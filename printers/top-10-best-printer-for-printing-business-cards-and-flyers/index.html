                   <h4> What People Say:</h4>
<div class="slideshow-container">
<blockquote><em><div class="a-row a-spacing-small review-data"><span class="a-size-base review-text review-text-content" data-hook="review-body">
<span>I am a long-time HP customer, and all my printers have been HPs.  My first printer, a black-and-white HP laser printer, lasted for many years.  It was followed by an HP DeskJet 940c color printer; this printer still works, but it is now difficult to find its cartridges (I only purchase HP cartridges, and the printer rejects out-of-date cartridges) and its function is limited to printing only.  My printers since then have been HP OfficeJet Pro All-in-One Printer/Scanner/Fax — HP 8610, HP 8630, and HP 8740 — each of which has unique problems.  The HP 8610 will scan to USB, but ruins the USB drive to which files and images are scanned.  The HP 8630 fails to recognize or acknowledge the presence of a USB drive but it will scan to PC’s using its wireless capabilities and it can print using both of its paper trays.  The HP 8740, the worst until now, fails to recognize or acknowledge the presence of USB drives, it will not scan to PCs unless the PC initiates the connection, it has frequent paper jams, and the second paper tray is useless as the unit will not acknowledge its presence.  As you might imagine, it is disappointing to spend money — at the time $399, $299, and $349 (after coupon and price-match), respectively — on these all-in-one printer/scanner/fax units and not be able to use all their stated features.<br/><br/>That said, the HP OfficeJet Pro 9015e is no different — it has problems too.  The first problem I noticed while removing it from the box is the lower quality of the build of the device.  The quality of my HP 8610, HP 8630, and HP 8740 is far greater than that of the HP 9015e; it feels cheap in comparison to the HP 8610, HP 8630, and HP 8740.  The HP 9015e does not even have a real paper tray — the back of its “paper tray” is open:  there are two long plastic hooks and no distinct location for the back placement of the paper.  Real paper trays have a clear front and back location for the paper within the tray.  The front door of the HP 9015e, via which one accesses the cartridges, does not have the high quality feel of the front doors of the HP 8610, HP 8630, and HP 8740, and this door does not close as soundly (and is not flush against the body of the unit!) as that of the other three units.  The HP 9015e does not even have a power button with a solid feel as the HP 8610, HP 8630, and HP 8740.  The sounds of the working HP 9015e are not satisfying as those for the HP 8610, HP 8630, and HP 8740:  the HP 9015e sounds rickety and as if it is falling apart.  Every time I print something, I wonder if this will be the last page I can print — I have owned this printer for less than one month at the writing of this review and there was a two-week delay before I could set up the printer at my office:  I should not feel this way about a brand new printer.  The output “tray” for the HP 9015e  is a disappointment and it does not hold printed pages well; it certainly does not hold printed pages as securely as the HP 8610, HP 8630, or HP 8740.  So far, I have been able to print several pages as well as scan to PC, initiated via the PC, but I have not been able to test the unit to its full extent.<br/><br/>Installation using the HP Smart App was TERRIBLE!  The connection options for the HP 9015e are wireless, ethernet, and USB:  all three should work, yet the HP Smart App refused to install the printer via USB connection.  After trying to connect the HP 9015e to my Windows 10 PC multiple times — too many times — using the HP Smart App, I downloaded the only other available software option to provide printer/scanner funtionality.  This software was also problematic as it directed me to wireless or ethernet connection, rather than USB connect to PC.  However, after multiple attempts, the USB connection between the HP 9015e and my PC was established — and accepted by the software; one should not have to endure inquires from software regarding one’s choice of connection type — the owner of the device chooses the connection type, not HP via its software/app.<br/><br/>Since I need a printer/scanner/fax at my office, I decided to keep the HP 9015e, rather than to return it.  However, I do have concerns about how long it will function and I am still in the process of determining which of its stated functions operate properly.  I do not appreciate HP trying to dictate how I connect and use the printer for which I paid:  I chose the USB connection and I chose to disable wireless printing since the printer is for my use (I paid for the printer and I pay for the cartridges), not for the use of others (who may wish to try to establish a wireless connection) at my place of work.  It is worth mentioning that the HP+ option did not appear when I installed the HP 9015e using the software rather than the HP Smart App; this is not good business, HP, as everyone purchasing this unit should be offered the same “bonus” options.<br/><br/>Based on my experience with a firmware update for my HP 8630, I would recommend that you disable HP updates.  After the last firmware update, my HP 8630 would not recognize the perfectly functional printhead installed in the printer; I had used my printer without issues prior to this firmware update.  After that update the HP 8630 displayed a message that the printhead was now missing or damaged!  To make a long story short, I was forced to purchase a new printhead for $179 in order to continue to use this printer!  I view this as unacceptable and bad business on the part of HP.  I have no intention of going through that for the HP 9015e; I plan to turn off HP updates so that they cannot be installed via my PC.<br/><br/>Due to the various problems that I have had with the HP 8610, HP 8630, and HP 8740 (especially its paper jams and the non-functional second paper tray), the HP 9015e may be my last HP printer because its build-quality does not compare favorably to any of the three.  What happened to the quality of my original HP laserjet and my HP 940c????  I have to wonder about the quality of future HP printers or HP all-in-one units based on the cheap feel of the HP 9015e.  I am disappointed, and I would not recommend purchasing the HP 9015e.</span>

<span>Setup instructions are woefully incomplete. Following the "easy three steps" shown, how can one expect the computer to see the printer if no provision is made to connect the printer to the network? Hidden on the printer screen and available in an auxiliary booklet "Reference Guide" and from the friendly phone service rep are the basic and easy steps to connect to the WiFi network. Printer setup seems unnecessarily intrusive, requiring (?) registration etc. However, once set up on a Windows 10 computer, the printer was readily discovered on Linux Mint (with HPLIP) and MacOS (with HP Smart). Scanning is rapid, and printing can produce glorious photos on photo paper. Lots of other features are available, but no instructions are provided. Some are intuitive, but what are all the pull out tabs and trays for?</span>

<span>Setup for printing, scanning, and copying was easy. The written directions that come with the printer are clear. I chose to set up on my Mac first and add the mobile device afterward. That is the reverse of the order HP recommends. But as a senior I find the computer screen easier to see and navigate than the smaller iPhone screen.<br/><br/>The printer goes offline when not in use. If you try to print while it is offline, you get a message that the computer can’t find the printer. This can be fixed by manually entering the IP Address in the Printers and Scanners App (Mac). If you don’t know how to do this, HP’s tech support will talk you through it.<br/><br/>Setting up the fax is a bit complicated if you use the same telephone line for voice and fax.<br/><br/>I mainly print and scan, make occasional copies and mostly send rather than receive faxes.</span>

<span>I’ve been a HP Printer customer for a long time.  I had enough of their high-priced cartridges, so I purchased the highly rated Epson EcoTank ET-15000.  It’s a very good looking and compact unit.  Easy to install and all functions worked great. But…<br/><br/>The reason I returned it was that its scanning of my old photos was disappointing (see pics).  I played around extensively with all the scanning settings but couldn’t get clarity or anyting that matched the HP.  I also printed some high-quality wedding pictures and clearly noticed that the Epson printed them out daker and less clarity.  In fairness I didn’t dink with the print settings and decided to return.  Its possibly my new ET-15000 was just a one off??<br/><br/>So I bought the HP 9025e which had improved results in scanning and printing (see pic) along with all the other functions needed.  Scanning Photos, scanning &amp; creating PDF Searchable documents, and quality photo printing were my top requirements.<br/><br/>Here is a summary of pros &amp; cons from my perspective<br/><br/>HP 9025e Con’s &amp; Pro’s<br/>- HP Support is weak, couldn’t help and wanted to send me to paid support<br/>- HP Support didn’t understand what a searchable (OCR) support was and sent me off to Adobe<br/>- Hard to install and get working using the internet connect option versus WiFi or USB<br/>-Tries to direct you to their HP+ SMART PRINTING app which I avoided<br/>- Not as good looking and too small of a printer user interface display<br/>O Initial Price but has expensive Cartridges<br/>+ Solid overall functional unit<br/>+ Much better Photo Scanning &amp; Printing<br/>+ HP searchable PDF scanning was imbedded into their software like the older units now😊<br/><br/>Epson ET15000<br/>+ Very easy to set up and phone support not required<br/>+ No push to move user to use Cloud services etc<br/>+ Great looking and compact<br/>+ Eco Tank versus Cartridges<br/>O I so wanted to keep the Epson 15000 but it was inferior for my key requirements<br/>- Poor photo scanning &amp; photo printing (see pics)</span>

<span>Ok this replaced my DEAD R2000 but I needed a 19 inch printer and did not have the money to invest in 800 dollar printer again. My Epson R2000 was 8 years old...and I did like that printer..but with lots of love hate relationships too. Ok this newbie arrived in good shape...happy to start learning the learning curves...a lot of differences between the two printers. It came with OEM ink I thought it wouldn't..but it did. That allowed me to get going instantly. I had ordered more ink however choose a non oem ink with good reviews. All went great to begin with. Printer was doing a great job with photos. I was doing a large 53 book project with 12 full half page photos per book. Also a large standup accordian photo display with about 20 photos. And four special photo albums with over 40 photos half page size. So lots of photos and asking a lot of a brand new never used printer to do. Now for the one star off. It sensed the low ink tank and warned me..it also stopped dead in mid job of printing if it ran out of said ink. I then replaced empty cartridge for new. It stepped up and printed just fine no flaws in the mid stop photo it was printing. This went on until all but the large black text cartridge had run out. Then the trouble begins. Printer did not always give me warnings that the tanks were low and it would print right through not stopping. OK...not good I had to make little to spare photo paper stretch for the project without changing to another type. This paper has great cardstock qualities for this kind of work. Ok so this happened once...twice....three times. By then I was checking  all the cartridges and if the back tanks were empty I replaced at the same time I had a warning for any other. So the question arises is this a bad cartridge problem from a Non Oem Ink product or is it the printer that isn't keeping good track. I have ordered new OEM cartridges to see how those work and new non oem cartridges from a different vendor. But I'm afraid that the printer is not counting the non oem cartridges properly. Now having nothing at all to do with that was the star off. When I changed a cartridge no matter if it was OEM or not the machine recognized that it was now full. BUT about half the time it did not print. It may or may not print when I switched out the new cartridge with a second new one and it printed fine..or problem still happened. The way this ink cartridge works would suggest air locks should not be a big problem. However that is what it appears to be. So I found a way to out smart the printer. I first check with a small color block page I made just for this purpose as it's a lot less wasteful and harmful to the printer than running head cleanings etc. If the color is not printing I close my program on computer. I turn off the printer then unplug the printer. This often is what is suggested to erase all previous connumications with printer. I wait about 20 minutes then turn printer back on and open program and resume printing but first of course running another color block check to be sure it is printing. It has worked every time this happened. It happened a lot. I went through a total of 25 cartridges todate during this project. And sure enough the very last cartridge it accepted but then did not print was a black and it was a new OEM ink cartridge...so that falls squarely on the printer itself.  There is some debate if the non oem cartridges are short in ink or if the printer is just not operating it's count. I can work around that. I am upset however that when I put in a new cartridge or two or three at a time the printer shows it's full thus accepting them but then not printing as if it's an air lock or ????? Makes no sense. This of course is all on a brandnew printer...my first experirence with it. I feel there is still a bit of a learning curve and shock it up to the fact I was spoiled rotten by the R2000 but it had it's elements of dishing out misery too and that major one was airlocking which started with it's own OEM ink. In fact I had never heard of off market inks until a year into the R2000 it began having airlocking fits. Using it's only cartridges. I had it under extended warranty and both them and the Epson help was working with me when suddenly the warranty folk accused me of using non-oem inks. I asked what is that? I got my education quickly. Turned out I ordered a batch and was thrilled with it and the printer for years worked fine actually better than it had with the OEM's and no air locking. Until one day a year ago troubles began again. So that led to worse problems and no amount of things that had worked previously helped. And finally one day it literally just died. WHich may explain why nothing was working because it had some internal programing problems or what have you and it was 8 years old. So for less than 140 dollars I decided to give this printer a try and needed one immediately. No complaints and why it's 4 stars overall with the exception of the refusal to print always after changing that color..but I explained how I get around this quirk. I can live with quirks within reason as long as I understand I need to do that. If I were a business however this wouldn't be acceptable..as a home office fun for the most part machine...I'm fine. By the way I didn't have one issue with any of the inks leaking. I took all review warnings about such to heart and handled all the cartridges carefully but no problem. I am concerned with the inside of the printer it looks like ink was thrown all over and splashes up on the cover and the bar above the rollers. I am not sure I need to clean that off periodically or just ignore. I'll double check with the customer service folks on that. For the price I'm more than happy with ink. Photos did not smudge and dried well using three different kinds of high gloss photo paper. They could be handled pretty quickly after printing though I usually gave them a few minutes to dry before cutting and glued some back to back for the books.</span>

<span>I bought this printer with the intent of printing my own art cards on 5 x 7 card stock. The set up was easy. The problem came when I wanted to print an image on one half of the card stock. The image prints all over the place and never in position of the formatting options. I use Microsoft OS and when I click on print I get the printer menu and it lists 5 x 7 paper and the option to print. The same for My Image Garden software that came with the printer.<br/><br/>First call:  I called tech support and explained the problem and the tech told me that I have to purchase 3rd party software to get the printer to print what it already is supposed to print. He suggested that I go online and search for software to print cards.  Seriously, this is crazy. When I called customer service an automated answering service took my information and then the line goes dead for anywhere between 15 and 45 minutes. I mean there is nothing and you might think you  where disconnected, but you are not, you are just in a phone limbo.<br/><br/>Second call:  I then called Canon again and made contact with a gentleman named Curtis. He took the time to listen to what I was talking about and together through a process of elimination we found the issue. My Image Garden was an older version, 2016, that came with the CD for installation.  It was a long call but I did get the printer set up for cards. So I will give then a another review and update when I print some cards and let you know how its working. So far, the images are beautiful, some more tweaking of the colors and I should be good to go.<br/><br/>UPDATE 3/11/2020<br/>This printer is amazing. The clarity of my prints and cards look fantastic. I purchase some metal coated paper and my automobile drawings are beyond what I expected. I have had to replace the cyan tank 2 times,, a lot of my art has strong blues in them and my local Office Depot carries them.  Next update will be around September.</span>

<span>I am very impressed by this machine and believe that Canon made a marketing error calling it a "business printer". I am an artist who uses photo reference, so I need a lot of good, detailed prints for my work. Previously, I was using the Pro9000 II. It made very nice photos, but I could not support its unquenchable thirst for ink. With 8 small cartridges, I was constantly ordering refills. The cost was terrible, but it was also extremely inconvenient--I never knew when I was going to be stuck in the middle of a project with no ink. I tried an off-brand refill system but it leaked all over the place. So, apprehensively, I decided to try one of the printers with fewer cartridges--at least with only 4 inks (I believe the pigment black is only for text) I could cut the problem in half. I decided that I could live with diminished print quality in exchange for the cost and convenience. Well, so far I am delighted with the prints from this model. With a little tweaking, I was able to get a near-perfect match to my monitor (I reset the printer with a bit less magenta and a tad brighter). I was never able to do this with the Pro9000 II, which was inconsistent from print to print. There is no visible deficit from having half the number of inks--transitions are just as smooth or better, colors are vivid, contrast is excellent. It's difficult to be certain, but details and textures might be ever-so-slightly sharper with the Pro9000 II, and the ink dots might be a tad more visible with the iX6820, but that's under very close scrutiny. So far I've printed about 12 8 1/2 X 11 prints and the ink levels are all above half--and that is using the smaller cartridges that came with the machine. That's already better than the Pro9000 II, which would have been demanding a fix by now.<br/>I have only been using it for about a week, so I can't attest to its durability--I hope it will continue to work this well. I also can't comment on the wireless capability. I just connected it to the USB cable I had from my last machine. It works fine with a cable but quite a few people have complained about wireless problems.<br/>UPDATE: Many months later, this printer continues to make excellent prints. I notice that when I don't make a print for a long time--maybe a few weeks--there will be a slight bit of banding in the first print that comes out, but that seems to work itself out quickly by the next print. This is excellent performance compared to the Pro9000, which had a lot of banding issues and needed to be cleaned and fussed with regularly. I have had 2 small problems that should be noted. The paper feed is somewhat unreliable--there have been a few times when I had to fiddle with the paper for 5 minutes or so to get the machine to grab onto it. Also, the ink sensor function is extremely premature, to the point of being useless. I was able to continue to make excellent prints for a very long time after the notification that inks needed to be replaced. Interestingly, when the ink finally does run out, the difference in prints is abrupt...you know right away. These are annoying defects, but the quality of the prints is still such an astonishing bargain that I am keeping the 5 star rating.</span>

<span>First of all, I own MANY printers, and I have owned about 20 different color laser printerS (HP, Xerox, older Brothers).  I am a printer fanatic, and currently have about 8 in operation in my real estate office.  I LOVE THIS PRINTER!!!<br/><br/>Setup was very easy (for wireless printing), or for USB.  The instructions were clear, and the printer set itself up all on it's own.<br/><br/>The time to 1st page out for full color printing is about 20 seconds, which while not the fastest on the planet is great for me, as I print LONG print jobs (mail merge letters of 1200 pieces at a time).  The print quality is superb!  I compared it side-by-side to output from a Xerox Versant 80 (a $70,000 printer), and the Brother prints we better!  The cost per page is outstanding!  Using 3rd party Super High yeild toner (which works great), the cost per page for full color is less than $.02/pg.<br/><br/>I have printed a couple of thousand pages so far in the first few days, and everything is working.  The rated print speed is 33 pages/minute.  On long print jobs the actual was more like 29 pages/minute as the printer stops to cool down from time to time.  A couple of minor complaints I have:<br/>1.  The output tray only holds about 200 sheets.  I wish it were bigger.<br/>2.  There is no "tray full" sensor to stop printing when the tray is full (the top of the printer).  If you don'y keep removing the output as it prints on large jobs, the output pages go all over the floor.<br/>3. The printer produces a slight curl in the printed pages, particularly with heavier stock..<br/><br/>Other than that, I love this printer!</span>

<span>I pretty much hate printers because they are so irritating - they run out of ink or they jam or they have setup issues or the ink and toner is too expensive or they don't easily hook up to my network.  I needed another heavy-duty color laser printer and loved my old Brother.  I have 9 printers in my office from label printers to ink jet to --- you name it, I've probably got it.  There's lots of brands that I've owned that I have not liked.  But I liked my other Brother laser printer so I decided to replace it with this one.  I am very impressed with the easy of getting it on my network and the great color.  It's fast.  The only one downside is that if I have anything like cardstock, it does jam.  I have tried feeding one at a time and that helps but it isn't so great for that.  I sometimes need to print my own inserts for different products I sell and it would be nice to be able to use thicker cardstock.  Other than that, it is a workhorse and is doing a great job for me.  I've had it for a while now.  I'm using it wired/ethernet.  Haven't tried it wireless.</span>

<span>I needed a printer that would handle 11X17 paper. My old HP wide-paper printer was starting to squeak and it was a pain to get to print every time I needed it. So I bought this one. It is very large but I managed to get it to fit in the space of the old printer. I didn't need the fax function nor probably the scan function. The set up of this printer went very smoothly, right up to the point where I told it to print something, then nothing. I had set it up to print via my wifi and it connected right away to the network, it just didn't print. As soon as I hit the print button the printer immediately sounded as if it were going to print but did not. I checked the "what printing" window via the control panel of Windows 10 and nothing was there. After trouble shooting for about an hour I gave up and plugged in the USB cable. I have another old HP printer that was supposed to work wirelessly but I never got it to work and I thought this printer might be the same. Shortly after connecting the USB cable I was printing no problem. After testing the 11X17 paper printing I decided to unplug the USB cable and the printer continued to printer wirelessly. Why's that? I have no idea. But the printer has continued to work properly via wifi since then. This printer has it's own email address and you can change the email address as you please. You take whatever document you want to print and email it to the printer's email address and it prints out. I tested that function and it was no problem. I noticed on some of the documents I printed to 8 1/2X11 paper that there was a black line down one side of the page. I have no idea what that's about. I'll try to fix that when I have time to waste. I found no printing funnies when printing 11X17 paper.  So far, except for the setup hiccup I described above, I'd give the printer a A-. I had to take off some for the setup hiccup. The printing is fast and clear, much faster than my old HP wide-paper printer and a clearer print I think too. I haven't tried photo printing on high quality paper as I have no interest in that at this time.</span>

<span>HP Smart app worked like a champ from ipad and iphone over wifi with no issues.  (I used ethernet port cable to my wifi router to get quick access).  I still need to vet the 11x17 quality, but first pass alignment and double sided 8.5x11 text prints look good.  Quick tip:  the ink cartridges are push to click ONCE, and a second push will release them, so make sure you know which state you are in.  Also, I managed getting this out of the box by myself, but recommend getting a second person’s help to avoid back strain and risk to the product / furniture.<br/><br/>UPDATED 4/4:<br/><br/>27 pages dual sided (14 pages effective) took one min to spool over wifi, 4 min total.<br/><br/>5.94 MB spool size<br/><br/>Single sided took 2:48 including spool time.  If you remove the one minute spool time then  this equates to 15ppm.  While this is slightly under the 18ppm advertised for color printing, that will vary based on print image density.  The resolution used for this document was 600dpi. (document was PDF : Credit Suisse Dec. 17 2018, “Initiating at Underperform, $102 target price for Zimmer Biomet Holdings”).  This document has many different font sizes and orientations as well as multi-color charts and graphs with fine resolution.  It looked good in both single and dual-sided versions.  One thing I did notice on a different document that had solid color headers : the two sides showed slightly different hues of the same reddish-brown color.  Odd pages were more brown while even pages were more red.  This was repeatable on multiple pages so it appeared to be a function of the print head, not the ink.  The effect was very subtle but this could matter to professional documents.<br/><br/>Received a local blue screen error “B85821E0” after scrolling thru a lot of usb pics and jumping around the menus.  I had to reinitialize the printer to recover from this.  The USB “in use” flicker warning kept blocking the menu bar, which is annoying.  In general I’d say the screen is nice but is not large enough to be useful for the level of touch screen swiping, etc. that we are used to on our phones.  The response rate is sluggish.  It was difficult to tell if this was due the large amount of pics I had on the flash drive or something else, but it was noticeable.  I need to explore what else can be done from the screen, but mainly I expect this to only be necessary for scan / copy functions.  Fax seems irrelevant if I can email my printer from anywhere :). I didn’t even see a phone cord in the box.  There is a sticker on the actual HP box confirming this but that is in contrast to the Amazon “what’s in the box picture”.</span>

<span>I'm (re)writing this review in the hope that it may help some of the folks out there who have struggled with the "Printer is offline" error message in Windows without much success. One post I ran across in an online support group said he had tried three different 7740 units and all gave the same error message and that HP tech support was useless. I'm sure that's probably true. I struggled with the same issue after a new wireless installation and it came close to driving me nuts. I seriously thought about sending the printer back, but the fact that the online poster had tried three different units gave me pause. The likelihood of three identical machines all being hardware defective in the same exact way is pretty darn small.<br/><br/>If you're lucky, the problem may be as simple as unchecking the "Use printer offline" box. Go to "Control Panel," "Devices and Printers," right click the HP 7740, click "See what's printing," then click "Printers" at the top of the next window and uncheck "Use Printer Offline." But if you're unlucky, like I was, "Use Printer Offline" won't be checked anyway. Don't panic. While I offer no guarantees that what I've written below will help and take no responsibility for any damage you may do to your setup trying to follow my advice, it may again be helpful for some people's situations, even for folks with a different printer.<br/><br/>Let’s think about what “Printer Offline” really means.  As many have said it doesn’t mean the printer is “off” or won’t print a test page from the control screen.  What it means is that Windows can’t find it.<br/><br/>There are at least two possible reasons for this.  One is that you have a driver conflict with a different printer.  You may not even think you have another printer installed, but because of how Windows operates you may.<br/><br/>Another cause may be that Windows can’t find your printer where it thinks it should be because of how your router is assigning your printer’s wireless (IP) address.  I suspect this is an even more common problem but has a fairly straightforward though involved solution.<br/><br/>The LEAST likely cause is a hardware defect.  As the example above shows, the likelihood that three identical units are all defective in the same way is practically nil.  It is almost always a problem with Windows “finding” the printer, that is to say, software communication issues, not with the printer itself.<br/><br/>OK – apologies for the length of this in advance.<br/><br/>In the case of a driver conflict – which I had, unbeknownst to me – I found the conflict when I right clicked on "Printer Properties" in "Devices and Printers (in Control Panel)," and then clicked the "Ports" tab.  There to my surprise was an HP driver installed for the HP Envy, even though I'd never had the Envy connected to this computer. (It was left over from cloning the boot drive from another OS.) The 7740 was listed as the default printer, but the Envy driver had the TCP/IP port and was “online.”  The Envy seemed to be confusing the OS into thinking that the Envy should be online and the 7740 shouldn't be.<br/><br/>The immediate solution there was to delete ALL the printer drivers (including the 7740) from the machine. (You can't delete MS XPS or Adobe PDF but that's OK.) You can try just deleting every printer listed in "Devices and Printers" by right clicking them and choosing "Remove Device," but you may need to use an uninstall program or go into the Windows Registry - which is NOT for novices.  (Basically DON'T if you don't know exactly what you're doing and aren't prepared to reinstall your whole OS. Fair warning!) Deleting drivers isn't always easy, but again, the error message is probably not caused by a problem with the 7740 hardware itself.  As other sites describe, I then manually reset the 7740 unit by unplugging it while it was still powered on, waiting 60 seconds, and plugging it in again. It powered on automatically.<br/><br/>Once I did that, I reinstalled the 7740 drivers MANUALLY in "Devices and Printers" using the "Add Printer" button. (It's usually the best way to do a wireless printer install anyway.) The OS found the 7740 using the TCP/IP port (the TCP/IP connection - always best), and it all worked fine – for a time.<br/><br/>That’s when I discovered the second likely cause for the “Printer Offline” error message.  Even though I no longer had driver conflicts, Windows still often lost track of the wireless address (the IP address) of the 7740.  Why would Windows do that?  Let me explain.<br/><br/>Modern routers assign IP addresses to any device that connects to your wireless network automatically by a protocol called DCHP.  Before DCHP, routers assigned addresses the way you get a social security number: each person gets her own unique number and no one else has it.  Good enough.  But because there can be so many devices connected to a home network, and also because as devices turn off and on they disconnect from and then reconnect to the network, DCHP will REUSE addresses from a disconnected device for a NEW device that connects (or an old device that reconnects), even if a device that reconnects had a different address before.  Or it may get an entirely new address.  Whatever.  This means that when your printer “goes to sleep” to save energy and thus disconnects from the network, when you go to wake it up to print something later, the DCHP router will give it a DIFFERENT IP address from the one it first had, but Windows, bless it, will still try to find the printer at its old IP address.  And if it can’t, which it often can’t, Windows will conclude that your printer is “offline” and refuse your new print job.  It’s the equivalent of the Post Office “Moved. No Forwarding Address.”  (DCHP is fine for most devices but for whatever reason doesn’t play well with many printers.)<br/><br/>Again, this isn’t the printer’s fault, though it is to some degree the manufacturer’s fault, since they don’t tell you how hard it can be to make a solid wifi connection for a printer to a network.  “Just put your install CD in your CD drive and…”  Yeah no.<br/><br/>So how to fix?  Well it can be intense but it’s been working for me for several days now, fingers crossed.<br/><br/>First, go to your router’s admin program.  It will have an address like 192.168.0.1  (Read the router manual.)  Type the address into your browser (the periods are important).  You’ll need the userid and password for the router, something like “admin” “admin1” depending on model.  Check the manual.<br/><br/>Go into your router IP address settings – maybe on a tab like "LAN settings" (manual will show).  This tab will show the router’s starting IP address setting – the numerically lowest address the router will assign to a device – and the highest IP address setting – the highest numerical address a router will assign.  These will typically be something like 192.168.0.2 and 192.168.0.255.  See photo.<br/><br/>Change the last three digits for the highest setting to any lower number – for simplicity’s sake say 250.<br/><br/>Apply the change.  Leave the router admin window open for now.<br/><br/>Go to your printer’s settings screen on the 7740 and locate the printer IP address, again something like 192.168.0.xxx.  Type that into a new window in your browser too.<br/><br/>You’ll then get the 7740 internal settings screen in your browser window.  Go to Networking, Wireless, and IPv4 addresses.  Deselect “Automatic IP” or “DCHP” and select “Manual IP.”  In the actual address space type in the first three segments of the numerical sequence you typed above, and then “251 (or 252 or 3 or 4)” for the last segment.  See photo.  Hit Apply/Save.  Also, on the “Network” tab choose “Network Protocols.”  “Check IPV4 Only” and “Apply.”<br/><br/>Ok.  A few more steps.  Go back to your router window to the LAN settings page.  If you’re lucky, your router will have a setting that lets you MANUALLY assign an IP address to a device.  See photo.  (Can’t help you here if you’re not.)  Get your MAC address for your printer from the printer settings “General Summary” page.  See photo.  Type that address into the “New Device” or whatever space on your router manual assignment page. The IP address should come up automatically.  See photo.  Exit your router setup.<br/><br/>Go back to your 7740 settings.  Go to “Network” “Advanced Settings” “Microsoft Web Services.”  Uncheck everything.  See photo.<br/><br/>Go back to HP 7740 in “Devices and Printers” and delete it by right clicking “Remove device.”<br/><br/>Next go to “Add Printer” on the “Devices and Printer” page on the upper bar, and choose “Add network printer.”  The wizard will search and should find the 7740 at the IP address you just assigned it, 192.168.0.251 or you can enter it manually.  (Remember, use the first three segments that your printer settings panel says, not this example.)<br/><br/>Go with “Use the current driver” or you may need to select the manufacturer and then the specific printer.  No worries.<br/><br/>When you get to “Print Test Page,” click it.  Your page should print, your printer now has a PERMANENT IP address so Windows should never lose track of it again and thus should never say it is “Offline.”<br/><br/>The reason this is so involved is why printer manufacturers don’t want to tell you to do all this to install a wifi printer.  And in many cases they don’t need to.  But in other cases they do.<br/><br/>This is also called “setting a static IP address.”  There are simpler procedures on the web but they didn’t work for me.  “Howtogeek.com” and “linerarthoughts.co.uk” are the main sources if you run into difficulties.  Again, when so many people are having the same problem it usually isn’t the hardware.  Hope this helps.  Please comment if you find mistakes.  Best of luck!</span>

<span>This replaced my old Officejet 2600. I shopped for quite some time and read all the reviews. I took a chance on this one. It does everything the old multi-function printer does and more. I really like the legal-size features and the scanner glass is huge. I do genealogy which sometimes requires very large sheets that fit the glass perfectly. It auto detects 2-sided documents and prints them. For even larger documents I use the HP Smart app which provides all the features I need to adjust and stitch them together. The Smart app takes a bit to get used to and is a little slow but it does everything I have needed. The install was fairly easy, it did take a bit to find and get on my wireless - maybe 5-10 minutes. The touch screen works fine, though it is a little small for my big fingers. No real negatives so far. It is fast. It has the ePrint feature like the old one and anyone that comes in can print to it from their mobile device. Be sure you check the footprint and have a space big enough to fit it - it takes up half my desk.</span>

<span>Hp smart set up didn't work. We went on hps page for this product and downloaded something called print doctor and diagnose and from there we had no probs wifi printing from the initial laptop we hooked the printer up to and subsequently all computers. We have had decent luck with hp products. We did have an hp printer die on us ages ago, but same with every company (Epson, brother, Canon especially absolutely horrible.) 2 year lifespan. We're hoping for the best. Family made me splurge on this 180 printer. Seems worth it. Fast period. Adding an edit: We didn't bother with the whole instant ink program. Idj</span>

<span>As usual, a great HP product. I upgraded (or downgraded depending on how you see it) from a Photosmart printer that has recently seen most of its apps be rendered unusable due to HP killing them off from that generation of printers. I was tired of the random quirks I was having with ePrint since they moved to a new service they call HP Connect. I'm also doing less photo printing and more document scanning.<br/><br/>First off: Yes, this printer can do automatic 2 sided scans! I was getting tired of trying to find if it did or not considering the material only points to automatic 2 sided printing and the ability to scan multiple documents to copy as 2 sided (2+ single sided to 1+ double sided). So I honestly bought it on a risk and also due to price when I bought it, $20 less than price shown on 1/18/17. When I installed it, I started messing around with settings and at the bottom of the page options for copying was 2 -&gt; 2 sided. It isn't mentioned anywhere, but that's the setting to take a 2 sided document and copy as a 2 sided document. There was also a 2 -&gt; 1 sided which allows you to undo the dual sided and copy each side as a single page. This will be a huge time saver with all the documents I plan on saving digitally.<br/><br/>Second: For the price, this is one of their faster models. Although color still lags behind after all these years, I feel it is still respectable at 11 ppm at best quality. The product page on HP claims it can be as high as 20 ppm or so if using draft. Considering the only color prints I'd use at best quality are photos, this is blazing fast to me. Black can get as high as upper 20's in draft. I have never seen a reason to print a document in best mode, so to have speeds of upper 20's black and roughly 20 color is more than adequate for most people. Also, draft mode ensures a longer life for your cartridges. Even during my heaviest printing times, I've had cartridges last me months using draft mode. And ever since getting the Photosmart as my first dual sided capable printer, I have bought paper in years! I admit though, I over bought paper a few years ago when Staples did buy 2 get 1 free on cases.<br/><br/>Third: I have always hated tri-color cartridges. Yellow is ALWAYS the first to go since black printing uses some yellow as well for whatever reason unless you set default document settings to gray-scale. Even when I would print photos way back when, the 3 colors never finished at the same time. A tri-color cartridge guarantees that you will have to buy a new one before using all the ink. Part of the reason I took so long to change printers was that HP seemed to have gone back in time to strictly tri-color. This printer though uses a single cartridge per color! Thank goodness. This is the 21st century, tri-color cartridges should be totally obsolete, or at the very least relegated to the cheapest of models.<br/><br/>Fourth: Wi-Fi connection appears very fast. There is a caveat though, this printer takes a while to start from a cold start. I sell often on eBay and print from the app. With the Photosmart, maybe due to the change in service, I used to have to wait a while before the printer processed what it was doing. With this one, as soon as the printer states it's online, it begins within seconds any print job received from either HP Connect or HP Direct (the mobile to printer connection that uses Bluetooth I believe). I have had consistent success with HP Direct since it takes out of the equation everything except my phone and the printer. HP Connect though I always had issues with. The eBay app seems to hate printer plug-ins, so I decided to try going the HP Connect route. This involves e-mailing the printer what you need to print. Well, I e-mailed a shipping label. I decided to sit down and wait the customary forever for it to print (based on Photosmart experiences). After hitting send and touching the chair to sit, the printer had already began the printing process. Since this printer was made after the switch to HP Connect, it went super fast! I can say I am completely impressed.<br/><br/>Fifth: Paper tray. Yeah I know how cares, it's a tray. But coming from a Photosmart, being able to put what looks like a third of a ream of paper into the tray is so nice. I always felt I was reloading paper too often on the Photosmart due to the small tray. I do miss the dedicated photo paper tray though.<br/><br/>That's all I could think of with my limited use of the printer thus far. The only negative is that I feel it takes too long to be ready from a cold start. I know it is partially my fault because I kill the surge protector to save as many pennies as I can. Florida Power and Light really loves shafting us with the power bills here in Miami. But I have restarted the printer without turning off the surge protector and it still took a bit longer than the Photosmart. But with 5 positives so far vs the Photosmart, whats a bit longer boot up time?</span>

<span>The print head on my Officejet 8620 went bad and it was almost the same price as buying a new printer to replace the print head. I should have just bought the print head. I mean this thing works but it is like a throw away printer that I feel like won’t last very long. I like to have things that last a few years.</span>

<span>I have owned HP printers forever.  Our old HP all in one was still going after 12 years but the scanner bed had gotten dirty and I also decided it was time to upgrade because I needed double sided printing and also the ability to print wirelessly from my iPhone and iPad.  A nearby Office Depot was closing its doors and having a big blow out sale to get rid of all its inventory so I decided to go look at printers thinking I could get a screaming deal.  I talked to one of the sales associates about my needs and she said this was a very popular model that offered all the features I want and then some.  They had it marked down from $180 to about $153 on sale.  Before I bought it I do what I always do and checked Amazon and was shocked to find that the exact same printer in the exact same package was only $99 with Prime!  I bid farewell to Office Depot (no wonder they're closing) and went right home and ordered it!<br/><br/>I have to say, so far I REALLY LOVE this printer!  First of all, it was the easiest printer to set up EVER!!  I mean, I truly couldn't believe it!  I'm a gadget tech nerd (built my own PC) and was prepared to have to spend an hour getting it all unpacked, turned on, calibrated, set up on my network and also connected to my devices for wireless printing.  That's what I'm used to.  Set up of this printer BLEW MY MIND with how simple it was!  Literally, you take it out of the box and remove all foam and plastic etc., plug it into the wall, press power, insert the ink (SO simple) and follow the instructions on screen to align the cartridges.  Once it was aligned the touch screen informed me to go to hp.com/setup to download the drivers I would need.  My computer/network automatically detected the printer and knew just what drivers I needed.  Download and setup was a breeze!  You can use the provided disk instead but I didn't even remove it from the sleeve.  The one thing I would say about HP and their software is that they tend to over do it.  My recommendation is to select the option that enables you to choose which additional programs you want installed instead of letting HP do it for you.  I always get way more than I bargain for and end up uninstalling a lot of the "bloatware" programs that I don't use that just take up HD space like HP photo etc.  I use photoshop.  There is an option for just the basic drivers that you can select.  Your printer will work just fine with those and you won't get blogged down with unwanted software.  Either way works great though.  I tried both.  The driver setup took 5 minutes.  Then I got on my iPhone and downloaded the HP ePrint app which IMMEDIATELY recognized and connected to my printer all on its own!  You can use it to print from your photos, the web, email and the cloud.  AWESOME!!!  That was it!  In about 12 minutes from the box I was completely set up, connect and printing!<br/><br/>Here are some other things I love about this printer:<br/><br/>- Fastest setup of any printer ever (yes I know I already mentioned this but it deserves repeating).  No having to manually enter IP addresses or anything like that!<br/>- Design is very sleek and modern.  I love the all black with little color screen!  It's pretty sexy as printers go!<br/>- Small/slim profile.  For everything this printer does and how well/quickly it does it, it really is quite small!  WAY smaller than my old HP all in one!<br/>- Touch screen is really high quality!  I often get frustrated with touch screens at check out stands and elsewhere because they're not very sensitive to your finger or pressing down in one spot causing a neighboring button to be selected.  That is NOT the case with this touch screen.  I find that it's very sensitive and accurate and also the display is crisp and beautiful!<br/>- AUTOMATIC DOUBLE SIDED PRINTING AND SCANNING.  HALLELUJAH!<br/>- Printing is very fast and the print quality is excellent, even and especially with photos!<br/>- I LOVE that this printer only needs one cable (unless you want to use the fax feature as well) and works so well wirelessly!<br/>- Printing from the app on my mobile devices is my new favorite thing<br/>- Unlike my old printer, this guy is whisper quiet when it's printing.  It's a little thing, but I live with an autistic 4 year old and a husband who sounds like he's calling in air support for a military strike when he talks on the phone so...sometimes the little things make a big difference!<br/>- Scan quality is really fabulous!<br/><br/>Honestly, I rarely give 5 star reviews to things, but this printer really does deserve it, from price point to set up to functionality and features.  I HIGHLY recommend this printer for all your in home office needs!  And no, I didn't get it for free or at a discount.  I paid full price for it and I would do it again!  I hope this helps someone else who is looking for an office upgrade!<br/><br/>UPDATE 1/21/17 - After a couple weeks I started having issues with this printer going offline spontaneously and the only way I could seem to get it back online to was by restarting my computer.  Around that time we also bought a Roku 4 and started having trouble with streaming.  The signal was dropping all the time.  I finally realized that it was because of our router, which, while a great work horse for many years, was getting seriously old in "tech years" and needed to be replaced.  I bought a dual band Asus router and ever since I installed it we have not only had flawless streaming but the printer now stays "online" all the time!  If you're having this issue with it going offline, I would look at your network setup before you blame the printer itself.</span>

<span>It prints so it's fine. I don't like it as much as my old one so I'm a little bitter. But the old did randomly die so maybe it's not that great. The paper tray is smaller so I have to reload more often. The screen/button area isn't super user friendly or intuitive.<br/><br/>You have to set-up through the app or a computer. They recommend the app, I hate having to download an app for set-up but it does work much better. Set-up was fine, pretty straightforward. If you have any issues/problems with the printer you solve them through the app or a computer it seems. The printer itself isn't much help. My printer randomly was having issues connecting to the wi-fi. I had to re-download the app after trying on a computer to fix it. I tried for like an hour and was about to return it (2 days left to return) when I tried one last thing - restarting my router. It worked. It's frustrating but I guess now I know. None of my other devices had issues so it's weird.<br/><br/>The print quality is fine, I've only done paper though. Double sided printing is annoying. You print the first side then turn the paper and put it back in so it can print the second side. Instructions pop up on my screen whenever I choose this option. However, if you already have more paper in the tray it'll automatically print on a second sheet. So you have to take all the paper out before printing double sided.<br/><br/>I keep getting errors when I print, it'll flash E 2 or something. Everything prints fine so I don't understand why it's giving me an error message.<br/><br/>I signed up for Instant Ink since it was free. Everyone recommends keeping it. It is super convenient to not have to think about ordering it. It just gets sent to your house automatically. You'll have to remember to cancel if you don't want to pay for it since you have to put payment info to get started. Starts at $1 a month, next tier is $4/month.<br/><br/>Overall, it's fine. It's relatively affordable and gets the job done. My old printer worked so much better and had better features for a similar price. Of course the new model is a lot more expensive so I opted for this one.</span>

<span>For the price, and for a home printer that’s occasionally used, it meets our needs. I got this printer a few weeks ago and it did take some time (an hour or so) to connect it to my laptop and cell phone (for the remote printing capabilities). I am not tech savvy, and I did get frustrated during the process. It also lures you in with “ink for 6 months!”…more like 1 month. I print the occasional paper for my kids school, a recipe here and there, and maybe a few sheets - it’s out of ink and I’d guess I’ve used 30 sheets. Definitely not 6 months worth, and definitely not if you’re using it as a primary printer. I’m disappointed because I think that was false advertising. For what I need it for, what it does and the cost, it’s fine for our home desk option. Don’t purchase if you’re using it for college kids who will need to print a lot, or for business/office use; you’ll run out of ink constantly. Let’s also mention the ink is $30…after 1 refill, I’m going to donate the printer and buy something else, or else I’ve spent more on ink refills than the device cost!</span>

<span>I'm shocked by the bad reviews. Setup was so easy. If you download the app and follow the instructions, the whole process takes 15-20 minutes and you'll be printing away. For a cheapo printer, it's does the job. The cost of ink (and the fact that they dry out quickly) has always been an issue for me, so I'm interested to see how this monthly subscription works out. $.99 cents a month seems like a good deal.

<span>Works well. HP makes you sign up for smart printing app to scan and it signs you out a lot.  More Passwords to remember. Nothing like needing to scan and having to sign in, but forgot your password.<br/>Important thing to consider is the cost of the toner after the original runs out.  Wow.<br/>The original toner does not last long. (maybe by design)  Replacement toner cost $420.00  for 2500 copies or $900.00 for 7500+- copies 414xl larger amount of toner....</span>

<span>The good:<br/> - Administration interface over HTTP/HTTPS is relatively intuitive and exposes a lot more functionality than the printer itself does on its touchscreen (as far as I could tell).<br/> - Sleep mode seems to work as intended, and as expected for a laser printer when not in use it is silent. Does not wake up for maintenance.<br/> - Supports a lot of protocols for printing to the printer (IPP/IPPS, AirPrint, some stuff through HP apps, Google Cloud Print, LDP, and a few more).<br/> - Thankfully allows for moderately complex setup of networking (can change hostname, configure/manage IPv4 and IPv6 networking, NTP time sync, etc.).<br/> - Wireless connectivity works as advertised. Did not try printing with a direct wireless connection, Bluetooth, or Ethernet (although options for managing all of those exist in the administration pages).<br/> - Printing works as expected. Seeing that this is my first laser printer, it is significantly faster than any inkjet I've printed. It doesn't take particularly long to warm up. Color printing of photos works well, although they seem a bit dark compared to a calibrated display (could also be the lighting in the rooms I was looking at wasn't the brightest). Details are sharp, and I'm honestly surprised at the quality. I'm not seeing any artifacting, really. I would still print photos with some other device (say, at Walmart or CVS or Walgreens using a dedicated photo kiosk) to conserve color toner (plus it'll likely be better), but this printer looks to be good for general purpose color printing.<br/><br/>The meh:<br/> - Support was prompt, but had me follow a pretty basic script to diagnose issues with the scanner. They were unable to fix my issues, and told me to get a replacement unit from Amazon, which I did. The fact that I had to get a new unit was an annoyance, and looking at all of the forums online, it looks like ADF issues with HP printers are very frequent. Either HP sells way more printers than everyone else combined, or HP has a quality control issue when it comes to ADFs.<br/> - Installation software for Windows is slow and sluggish (and hung once for me). I expect some of that is downloading a whole swath of archives, but it also hung for about 20 minutes trying to set up faxing (I think, the UI was glitching) even though I didn't need to set that up. The second time I went through the setup the software didn't hang, although sometimes it looked like it did. It went much faster.<br/><br/>The bad:<br/> - Bug in the web server: if the password for the email account one is going to use to send notifications has an ampersand (&amp;) in it, the web server or whatever service the printer has escapes "&amp;" to "&amp; amp" (without the space, Amazon seems to be filtering out the &amp; HTML code) (e.g. "abc&amp;123" becomes "abc&amp; amp123"), which obviously causes SMTP authentication to fail. Since the internal software for the printer is closed source, there is nothing I could do to fix that. This is something that HP will have to address.<br/> - For my original printer, ADF scanning was tilted/skewed, which seems to be a common problem. Seeing that I specifically bought this printer for its ADF (otherwise I would have picked a Brother with better reviews for a color laser printer), this was a deal breaker for me. I followed instructions from HP support to clean the (brand new) ADF sheet feeder rollers, and to adjust the paper binders of the ADF, to no avail. They told me to send the printer back for a replacement, which I received. The very first thing I tested was the ADF alignment, since if that was bad I was just going to request a full refund and just buy a printer from a different manufacturer. Lucky for HP (for now), this ADF seems to work better.<br/>- This second printer developed a squeak when feeding paper through the system. HP support thinks is the toner/drum, but I tested removing one at a time to no avail, and the drum is very securely held in the system so I did not remove it (requires removing parts of the casing and unscrewing some elements and manually disconnecting a bunch of small wires). HP support did send a technician to look at it, and they replaced the power board, which changed the squeaking/chirping noise slightly, but it was still there. The first printer did not have this. In the end, I returned the second printer to Amazon for a refund.<br/><br/> --<br/><br/> I did notice something about the ADF which seems like a design flaw, and might be the cause of all of the mis-alignment complaints that plague a lot of HP ADFs. Well, really two things, but related: 1. There is only one motorized wheel in the middle of the ADF to move papers through the ADF for scanning, and 2. it seems like this roller sticks out a tiny amount from where the paper rests in the ADF, so if the paper guides aren't set properly, the paper, once pushed into the ADF securely, will most likely lean to one side or another, likely leading to the skew or tilt I saw with the other printer. The paper guides must be set pretty much perfectly (tall order) to prevent this skew. I noticed this with my current printer, but I took a lot more care to make sure the paper guides were pretty much perfect to prevent the paper from tilting inside the ADF. The way to do this (or at least how I did it) is to take a stack of papers, place the papers on the ADF but don't push them all the way in (so the stack doesn't swivel around the wheel), make sure they stay as much as in a stack as possible, and now adjust the paper guides around this stack (the way I did this was over-adjusting the guides so the papers bent a little, then holding the guides with one hand and pushing the paper flat with the other slowly, so that the guides were slowly pushed to the perfect size). So long as nothing touches the guides after this adjustment (and one doesn't get a defective ADF), there should be next to no tilt or skew.<br/><br/>I've taken a few pictures of the print quality report the printer took. The first picture is one of both the original (on the left), and the copied one, read in from the ADF. Notice the lack of a skew. The second picture is a closeup of the original quality report, and the third picture is the copy of the quality report as scanned through the ADF. One thing to note with the third image is  that it seems that with solid colors, the scan produced some line patterns. Since I haven't played enough with the scanner yet, I don't know if this is a limitation of the scanner, the result of some pre/post-processing to "clean-up" the image, or just the quality of the scanner. Looking at the quality of the printer, it's not the printer part that's producing those artifacts.<br/><br/>Overall: If you get a printer with a decent ADF, it seems to be a good color laser printer for its price. Some units tend to have a bad ADF, and even with a good printer it looks like the ADF has a design flaw that makes it difficult to line up the pages, but it can be made to work. Printer works as expected and I am pleased at how fast it is, and the web administration is pretty nice. I'm taking one star away for the password bug I mentioned and how finicky the ADF can be, and another for HP's bad QA, otherwise this looks like a capable printer. I would like to see HP design a better ADF for future models, though. I'm sure some people will like the printer, but I just don't want to deal with the possibility of getting another bad one, so I will be taking my business elsewhere.</span>

<span>As other have mentioned this printer's setup is way too much for this day and age. I am very technical. HP needs to revamp the installation software. Runs through continuous loops. Scan to printer is hard to get working. Once setup works great.<br/><br/>Worst of all the toner is out of this world expensive. HP charges $800 for all 4 cartridges. You can get 3rd party on Amazon for $140 a set that work great. Come on HP. Really? A set of cartridges as much as the printer itself. At most should be 25% of the cost of the printer and even then you would be paying for another printer after 4 replacements.</span>

<span>This is our second Epson TM-C3500 and we'll buy a third when this one dies.  It's a reliable, flawless printer for us for printing wine labels.  Everyone knows that the manufacturers are sticking it to us on ink prices.  But at least this one is reliable, runs without problems, doesn't need nozzle cleanings except rarely and is a workhorse.  It's small, and versatile in terms of paper feed. With the pigment ink, our poly wine labels could go right into a tub of water and ice right after printing and never bleed.  All in all, just what we need.</span>

<span>The printer works great. I haven't had any issues with paper jams like some people. The paper tray doesn't hold as much as my previous HP printer. Maybe people try to put too much paper in it and that's why they get a paper jam. I read many reviews about setting up this printer. I wanted to make sure that I followed the instructions. I opted to set it up on my computer rather than with the QR Code thinking that it would synch the computer and printer during the process. I typed in the address and as it popped up there was a listing that had set up after the suggested URL. I believe I clicked on that. DON'T do that. It is a scam website pretending to be Canon. They tried to get me to pay for a tech support contract. I know that this isn't Canon's fault and it really doesn't have anything to do with the printer itself. However, I wanted to bring it to people's attention because the person I dealt with was very good at trying to convince me to pay for their service. That he was employed by Canon. While he was on the phone I checked the exact web address in the instructions and the screen was completely different. Use the EXACT web address in the instructions if you are setting this printer up through a computer and not with the QR Code.</span>

<span>First of all, I had to go to a bricks-and-mortar store to find out where the paper tray was.  I wanted to put the printer into a utility closet with an outlet and print without moving it, and until I could see the paper tray, I couldn't purchase it.  Just showing the front of the printer without the open paper tray was not enough.<br/>I set up this printer with my MacBook Pro running OS 10.14.6.<br/>The power button is all black -- it lights up nicely when it. is on but is a bit difficult to find when it's off, although the setup sheet does show the location.<br/>I had trouble getting AirPrint to work.  The setup sheet gives you enough information to get what I think is called Direct Print to work over your wireless network, but that's not enough for AirPrint -- you have to set up Wifi Infrastructure Mode, and the Epson online help is no help.  Using Google, I eventually found an Epson YouTube video that showed how to do this from the printer's front control panel.  Before I downloaded and used the 7100 User Guide, I also set up Epson Connect and the iPrint app, and after they did not help with AirPrint, I wondered if I would ever use them at all (but I did use iPrint, see below!). These different wireless print options and a one-sentence description of what each is good for should be on the Setup Sheet.<br/>Color print from MS Word, Excel, and Notes on iPhone and iPad worked perfectly the first time (once I had AirPrint).<br/>Then I started checking functions from the User's Guide, including several I've never done with any other printer.<br/>Duplex color copy and scan worked perfectly the first time, even though my input was an old and slightly<br/>wrinkled drawing.  I did both from the Automatic Feeder Tray with the printer control panel.<br/>Photo print from Preview came out really well, even though I had only Another Brand photo paper instead of the Epson Ultra Premium Glossy paper I prefer.<br/>Photo print from a camera memory card, using the front printer control panel, also came out very well (my photo wasn't so great, so I won't say it was excellent yet) and I was able to preview what was on the memory card and select a layout right from that panel, without my computer.  I didn't try transferring those photos from the printer to the computer because I put the memory card away before I saw that was possible, but I did confirm the Mac could see the printer over the network.<br/>I checked the printer supply levels from the printers and scanners icon in System Preferences.<br/>Finally I printed a layout of four 4x6 photos from my iPhone using iPrint.  Worked fine.<br/>I am amazed at what this printer can do.</span>
