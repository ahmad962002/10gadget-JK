<div class="slideshow-container">
<blockquote><em><div class="a-row a-spacing-small review-data"><span class="a-size-base review-text review-text-content" data-hook="review-body">
<span>I'm shocked by the bad reviews. Setup was so easy. If you download the app and follow the instructions, the whole process takes 15-20 minutes and you'll be printing away. For a cheapo printer, it's does the job. The cost of ink (and the fact that they dry out quickly) has always been an issue for me, so I'm interested to see how this monthly subscription works out. $.99 cents a month seems like a good deal. We'll see.</span>

<span>It prints so it's fine. I don't like it as much as my old one so I'm a little bitter. But the old did randomly die so maybe it's not that great. The paper tray is smaller so I have to reload more often. The screen/button area isn't super user friendly or intuitive.<br/><br/>You have to set-up through the app or a computer. They recommend the app, I hate having to download an app for set-up but it does work much better. Set-up was fine, pretty straightforward. If you have any issues/problems with the printer you solve them through the app or a computer it seems. The printer itself isn't much help. My printer randomly was having issues connecting to the wi-fi. I had to re-download the app after trying on a computer to fix it. I tried for like an hour and was about to return it (2 days left to return) when I tried one last thing - restarting my router. It worked. It's frustrating but I guess now I know. None of my other devices had issues so it's weird.<br/><br/>The print quality is fine, I've only done paper though. Double sided printing is annoying. You print the first side then turn the paper and put it back in so it can print the second side. Instructions pop up on my screen whenever I choose this option. However, if you already have more paper in the tray it'll automatically print on a second sheet. So you have to take all the paper out before printing double sided.<br/><br/>I keep getting errors when I print, it'll flash E 2 or something. Everything prints fine so I don't understand why it's giving me an error message.<br/><br/>I signed up for Instant Ink since it was free. Everyone recommends keeping it. It is super convenient to not have to think about ordering it. It just gets sent to your house automatically. You'll have to remember to cancel if you don't want to pay for it since you have to put payment info to get started. Starts at $1 a month, next tier is $4/month.<br/><br/>Overall, it's fine. It's relatively affordable and gets the job done. My old printer worked so much better and had better features for a similar price. Of course the new model is a lot more expensive so I opted for this one.</span>

<span>Light weight and compact enough to not get in the way. Prints fast for me. Easy to assemble but to setup you will need to install the App on your phone or PC for it to work. If you have trouble printing right with Windows 10 it is due to MS update and there is a patch for it, the link in the app so you can install the driver. Wireless and you can print from anywhere to the printer. Also an option for HP+ and Instaink so they send you ink when you are low before you run out, you pick your plan on how many pages per month you use or change it whenever. Never run out of ink. The basic low end is only 99 cents a month!  You can choose to opt out of it. Cannot comment on durability and life because I just go it the other day. But with HP+ there is a 2 year warranty included.</span>

<span>My HP 3 in 1 printer that I bought a long time ago finally died. So first and foremost HP products are awesome. The printer I had before which had the copy and the scanner I actually bought it at Costco and I'm going to say I had that machine for 10 years.<br/><br/>So when that one died I saw this one on Amazon and noticed the price had come down and I had to have something so low and behold I bought it. It's a nice little machine they have a program where you can buy ink for the machine at a discount rate if you join this club thing I think it's for 6 months. For me it just really wasn't worth it I would just rather buy the ink on my own. But it may work for you. I like to get the remanufacturing. And there's a couple of places that I buy it through online. I actually haven't checked here on Amazon but I will do that.<br/><br/>The scanning feature works perfectly I have no complaints. The copy feature works like a charm! And it folds up nice and neat. You pull out a little flap and it has a paper guide from when your item is done printing or copying and then it folds nicely back up. She don't have any flap sticking out that will break or anything like that it's nice it's perfect compact I love it. Also the other thing that I like about this machine is that instead of the paper being fed from the front there's actually a paper guide so you can only put in so many sheets of paper which prevents it from getting stuck into the roller. So if anyone has any doubts I would say go ahead and get this it comes quickly it's pretty easy to figure out. I highly recommend this.</span>

<span>So this was really easy to set up from the Quickstart guide. Just download the software, your quickstart guide gives the website address. Don't use the included disk because it will be out of date. Plug in the printer, plug in a USB printer cable, no it doesn't come with one but I have spares from old dead printers. Plug cable into computer, turn on printer. Windows will automatically install drivers, this isn't a problem. Run the software installer. It will walk you through the installation. Put in your network key when it asks you, not your router password. It connects right away to your network. Unplug USB from computer. After installation you can use the included IPrint &amp; Scan software tool icon to tweak your printer settings from browser based ip address that opens automatically when you click on the tool icon. You can log into your settings using the admin password that's on back of the printer and this will give you a more complete set of settings. You can print out the initial settings from there as a baseline in case you change something and don't like it. The menues are pretty self explanitory though lack detailed info. You can download all the many printer guides from the Brother site for your printer. The complete online guide is good for opening in your web browser and being able to click on the table of contents to quickly get to what you want. If you save it as a PDF you won't be able to click the TOC links. It's too fat to print out unless you like wasting toner and paper. This guide gives all the printer menu options on the LED and how to access them from the printer. You can set the toner Continue mode from computer, the deep sleep mode has to be set from there printer. I haven't had any problems with it coming out of deep sleep. The printer automatically enters sleep mode but comes out fast, warms up fast from power on and prints very fast. The double sided setting works very well. You can set your print preferences from your print options menu from whatever program you are using, toner save, paper type, toner density etc and save them in custom settings tab. I'm using a 20 lb paper, so it does curl from the heat. I'll try a thicker 32 lb paper for when I need better copies. I ran 80 lb smooth cardstock through and it handled it well but did get some heat curling. The printer doesn't feel hot. Paper just doesn't like heat. It's not that big or heavy and fits well in my small office. The cord is a decent enough length, 3 pronged. Paper tray is adjustable to different sizes. Print is good and clear, toner can be adjusted from very dark to toner save, in your printing preferences. Sign into brother-usa.com to register your machine. I'm using this to print plain documents and high quality black and white graphics. Grey tones are good too if that's what you are needing. Brother Creative Center has lots of free projects you can use for printing or to use their graphics. I like Brother products, have had good experience with them. Haven't decided if I'm going to use after market toner or stick to Brother. Depends on how fast I end up going through toner. I'm giving a 5 star rating for tech support though I haven't called them for this printer, that rating is based on tech support I've received with my other brother all in one ink jet and my brother scan n cut. The printer came new, well packaged and fairly fast. It's not pretty if you're looking for pretty. Please note I've had this printer only one day and if things change I'll update to reflect that. I paid full price for this printer, 115.00, so this review is totally my own.</span>

<span>Was easy to set up. I suggest you download the “HP Smart” app on every device you plan to print 🖨️ from. It makes it so much easier. I even downloaded the app to my kids devices so there is no issues. I placed the printer 🖨️ in the spare bedroom so that it’s easily accessible to all of us. That’s the best part of it being wireless. It helps if you have a decent Router with an extender which helps with the wi-if that you will need for setting up and printing🖨️.<br/>The print 🖨️ quality is nice for a desktop.

<span>Installing this printer was a little glitchy. I first removed the packaging material and plugged into power. I installed and ran the full software, not the HP Smart thing. When I ran the installer I choose to setup via wireless, It did not find the printer. I figured, whatever, and connected my USB cable. After installing the printer software via USB, I was able to double check the manual from HPs website to locate the option to change wireless settings. Under Tools &gt; Device Setup &amp; Software &gt; Reconfigure Wireless Settings. I was easily able to switch from a USB connction to wireless. It did prompt to remove the USB cable after though. The biggest annoyance was me not paying attention to the pictures. I wouldn't have bought it if I knew it only had the top paper feed tray instead of an actual hidden paper tray drawer. I had to tell myself it's a cheap printer. The main reason I purchased this printer was for the multi page scanning ability. My old HP Photosmart 6510 was only a single page scanner and took forever to scan a multi-page document, then the file size was enormous. For as much as I'll use this, I couldn't justify spending $250-500 on a nice full featured printer. It's a printer, it prints, it does what it's supposed to do.</span>

<span>I just realized that I've had this printer for a little over a year, and although I almost never post reviews of the many items I purchase from Amazon, this HP printer is worth a review.  I've had a number of wireless printers over the years, and I have never had sustained success keeping them connected to Wi-Fi - in each case, I could only use it when connected to a cable.  This printer set up quickly and easily, and does exactly what I need it to - print or make copies (both very occasionally) in my home office.  Printer quality is fine for what it is, as well as speed.  Once, it disconnected from Wi-fi and then seamlessly got itself reconnected with little effort on my part.  I can't emphasize how different this is from any other printer I've had.  Also, I have used it with a Mac, a Windows computer, iphones and ipads with ease.</span>

<span>I spent 3 hours on the phone with Epson customer &amp; tech support. I bought this printer mainly for the auto two-sided printing...I really wanted auto two-sided printing (plus the larger sizes). Monday, I spent 4 hours trying to get it to print on both sides on its own to no avail.<br/><br/>So I called tech support. For an hour the support guy tried to help, and failed. He said it was hardware malfunction. To get a replacement though I would have to let them put a ~$250 hold on my card. I said that was unacceptable [I get that their POV about sending a $400 printer to someone who already has a $400 printer, but I'm not giving you *more* money when what you gave me doesn't work and not everyone has $250 they can just "hold"... thats like a tank of gas for some of y'all right now] So I asked to speak to a manager.<br/><br/>The manager said the printer only auto prints for letter and legal. The website and all advertising online just says auto two-sided printing. The only caveat is anything bigger than 8.5x14 has to go in the back tray and that tray requires manual flipping. I was trying to print 7x10, which fits in the front tray. I explain that the company needs to be clear about what the printer does and doesn't do, that their website is MISLEADING--it's borderline fraud. Dude tells me it's in the manual ('cause I totally had a manual before I bought the printer???) and says I should have known; it's not their fault....<br/><br/>After I went off, he transferred me to customer service so I could make a formal complaint and they admitted the wording should be more clear.  They started a case/process for my complaint.<br/><br/>But I'm an engineer and I was not satisfied with the notion that it didn't work. Mechanically it didn't make sense. So I played around with it some more last night and as long as you choose a preset size that is close to your actual paper size (I chose JIS B5 since its closest to 7x10) the printer *DOES* auto 2-sided print for non-letter sized documents. The techs and managers just don't know how to use the products...which is understandable because it took someone with a PhD in Embedded Systems 2 days to figure it out...</span>

<span>I've been using an Epson Stylus 2200 for about 20 years and have loved it.  But recently it quit working and I learned they aren't making the drivers for Windows 10 any longer, so I was forced to buy a new printer.  I'm an amateur photographer and want my pictures to be vivid and look professional.  It took me only about 30 minutes to set this one up (and some of that time was just waiting for it to calibrate) and the first picture out the gate looked better than my screen version.  I then printed a 13 x 19 and it was brilliant.  Better than the one I had printed at a print shop.  Finally, I printed 10 4x6 photos and every one of them was true to color and I'm proud to give them as gifts.  If you're a pro, this might not be for you, but if you're like me, this printer is affordable (the printer itself) and produces more than decent results. I'd recommend it.  One thing...I'm not sure if it's my computer or the printer doing this, but every once in a while it closes photoshop when I press print.  I'll have to figure that out.  A small nuisance.</span>

<span>Only thing keeping it from 5 stars is it seems a little flimsy from my previous HP printer.  But I feel this is just trying to make things less expensive on the manufacturing side.  The print quality, auto feeder feature, scan all are top level quality so far.  I just feel like I have to be real careful pulling out trays and opening the top to replace print cartridges but so far we are very happy with it especially the size.

<span>I have owned HP printers forever.  Our old HP all in one was still going after 12 years but the scanner bed had gotten dirty and I also decided it was time to upgrade because I needed double sided printing and also the ability to print wirelessly from my iPhone and iPad.  A nearby Office Depot was closing its doors and having a big blow out sale to get rid of all its inventory so I decided to go look at printers thinking I could get a screaming deal.  I talked to one of the sales associates about my needs and she said this was a very popular model that offered all the features I want and then some.  They had it marked down from $180 to about $153 on sale.  Before I bought it I do what I always do and checked Amazon and was shocked to find that the exact same printer in the exact same package was only $99 with Prime!  I bid farewell to Office Depot (no wonder they're closing) and went right home and ordered it!<br/><br/>I have to say, so far I REALLY LOVE this printer!  First of all, it was the easiest printer to set up EVER!!  I mean, I truly couldn't believe it!  I'm a gadget tech nerd (built my own PC) and was prepared to have to spend an hour getting it all unpacked, turned on, calibrated, set up on my network and also connected to my devices for wireless printing.  That's what I'm used to.  Set up of this printer BLEW MY MIND with how simple it was!  Literally, you take it out of the box and remove all foam and plastic etc., plug it into the wall, press power, insert the ink (SO simple) and follow the instructions on screen to align the cartridges.  Once it was aligned the touch screen informed me to go to hp.com/setup to download the drivers I would need.  My computer/network automatically detected the printer and knew just what drivers I needed.  Download and setup was a breeze!  You can use the provided disk instead but I didn't even remove it from the sleeve.  The one thing I would say about HP and their software is that they tend to over do it.  My recommendation is to select the option that enables you to choose which additional programs you want installed instead of letting HP do it for you.  I always get way more than I bargain for and end up uninstalling a lot of the "bloatware" programs that I don't use that just take up HD space like HP photo etc.  I use photoshop.  There is an option for just the basic drivers that you can select.  Your printer will work just fine with those and you won't get blogged down with unwanted software.  Either way works great though.  I tried both.  The driver setup took 5 minutes.  Then I got on my iPhone and downloaded the HP ePrint app which IMMEDIATELY recognized and connected to my printer all on its own!  You can use it to print from your photos, the web, email and the cloud.  AWESOME!!!  That was it!  In about 12 minutes from the box I was completely set up, connect and printing!<br/><br/>Here are some other things I love about this printer:<br/><br/>- Fastest setup of any printer ever (yes I know I already mentioned this but it deserves repeating).  No having to manually enter IP addresses or anything like that!<br/>- Design is very sleek and modern.  I love the all black with little color screen!  It's pretty sexy as printers go!<br/>- Small/slim profile.  For everything this printer does and how well/quickly it does it, it really is quite small!  WAY smaller than my old HP all in one!<br/>- Touch screen is really high quality!  I often get frustrated with touch screens at check out stands and elsewhere because they're not very sensitive to your finger or pressing down in one spot causing a neighboring button to be selected.  That is NOT the case with this touch screen.  I find that it's very sensitive and accurate and also the display is crisp and beautiful!<br/>- AUTOMATIC DOUBLE SIDED PRINTING AND SCANNING.  HALLELUJAH!<br/>- Printing is very fast and the print quality is excellent, even and especially with photos!<br/>- I LOVE that this printer only needs one cable (unless you want to use the fax feature as well) and works so well wirelessly!<br/>- Printing from the app on my mobile devices is my new favorite thing<br/>- Unlike my old printer, this guy is whisper quiet when it's printing.  It's a little thing, but I live with an autistic 4 year old and a husband who sounds like he's calling in air support for a military strike when he talks on the phone so...sometimes the little things make a big difference!<br/>- Scan quality is really fabulous!<br/><br/>Honestly, I rarely give 5 star reviews to things, but this printer really does deserve it, from price point to set up to functionality and features.  I HIGHLY recommend this printer for all your in home office needs!  And no, I didn't get it for free or at a discount.  I paid full price for it and I would do it again!  I hope this helps someone else who is looking for an office upgrade!<br/><br/>UPDATE 1/21/17 - After a couple weeks I started having issues with this printer going offline spontaneously and the only way I could seem to get it back online to was by restarting my computer.  Around that time we also bought a Roku 4 and started having trouble with streaming.  The signal was dropping all the time.  I finally realized that it was because of our router, which, while a great work horse for many years, was getting seriously old in "tech years" and needed to be replaced.  I bought a dual band Asus router and ever since I installed it we have not only had flawless streaming but the printer now stays "online" all the time!  If you're having this issue with it going offline, I would look at your network setup before you blame the printer itself.</span>

<span>I have had many HP inkjet printers over the past 20 years, and this one isn't my favorite, but it gets the job done for a small Home Office. For us, the Home Office is defined as 2-4 computers running Windows or Mac OS, 30-100 pages printed per week, 300 scans per week). Despite the printer not being the best option for heavy scanning, it makes sense for printing quickly and cheaply in color. The ink quality on documents and worksheets that contain photos or clipart is rich, and outshines some color lasers I have used.<br/><br/>PROS:<br/>- Fantastic scanning of color-text documents. The scanning bed and auto-feed pick up great details from 75 to 1200 DPI.<br/>- The Auto Document Feeder (ADF) can actually handle quite a bit more than 35 pages! If you’re scanning hundreds of double-sided worksheets, you don’t need to babysit the ADF.<br/>- HP Easy Scan is a MUST for Mac OS users to get the most out of the scanning features. While Mac OS has great built-in scanning software, you’ll want access to Searchable Text PDF options only provided in the HP Easy Scan that uses fantastically accurate OCR software (courtesy of ReadIRIS software). I am archiving multi-language Hungarian, Japanese and English documents, and picking the more character complex language (i.e., Japanese) allows me to capture the Roman letters of Hungarian and English. Unfortunately, there is no multi-language function so it doesn’t pick up the accented Roman letters of Hungarian if I set it to OCR Japanese.<br/>- AirPrint and Bonjour functionality meant the printer was quickly and immediately discovered on our Mac systems running Mac OS 10.12 and beyond. We might've gone to Apple Support to install the latest of all HP Printer Drivers, but it was a quick fix that allowed printing within seconds.<br/>- Has USB port in easily accessible location on front of printer.<br/><br/>CONS:<br/>- Ink cartridges were very hard to release from orange twist-caps. We were concerned we would break them.<br/>- The Auto Document Feeder (ADF) rollers have a hard time picking up ultra glossy magazine paper.<br/>- The ADF CANNOT scan “too short documents” such as A5, or most "book-sized" documents. You’ll need a dedicated scanner for archiving books, unfortunately. This also means you cannot scan photos, business cards or receipts in the ADF, you must use the flatbed.<br/>- The "Scan to Computer" function is grossly under-supported. There is no Scan to Computer functionality for Mac OS--you must activate the scanner from the Mac in either Image Capture or HP Easy Scan. I recommend HP Easy Scan because of the Searchable Text function.<br/>- The printing drivers and scanning software on Windows systems is extremely slapdash. Windows 7 and some Windows 10 computers had a hard time finding the printer on the same Wi-Fi network. Once it was found, the Windows 7 computer took some time to locate the printer using HP Easy Scan/Scan to Computer. HP appears to have retired HP Easy Scan for their new "HP Smart" app for Windows 10 computers. But the new HP Smart app is also extremely buggy and may not find the printer, even when you type in the IPv4 address of the printer directly into it. The options on where to save the scanned files is also lacking. I set up 5 Windows Machines and 3 Macs to this printer for scanning--I spent 2 minutes on each Mac and about 20-30 minutes per Windows machine--including Windows 10! I do not have confidence in others to know the nuance for HP Easy Scan and HP Smart for scanning.<br/>- Cannot scan to network folders (i.e., if you have FTP or Shared Folders set up via your home office router, this cannot connect to them via SMB protocol). We don't need it since there is a shared public folder on one Windows machine where we'll save the Scanned Documents. It's a work around, sure, but it works.</span>

<span>This printer is exactly what I was looking for. It was delivered a few hours ago, and I had it all set up in under 20 minutes.  I set up the wifi manually because I was too lazy to find a USB cord, but it was very easy to do anyway. All I had to do was go to the network settings in the printer's menu and enter my passkey. I downloaded the drivers off of the website, but there is also an included cd if needed. I've had to set up a few printers in the last few years, all were inkjets, and this Brother laser printer was by far the easiest to get up and running. It is so nice to have a working printer again. Bye-bye inkjet printers!<br/><br/>Update: I am still really happy with this printer, so I'm leaving my 5-star rating, but I have found one minor issue. I currently can't print from my phone. I believe the issue is that I have a broadband modem that is a bit quirky and it randomly selects which band it will let me connect to, so I keep getting a message that my printer isn't on the same network even though it is. I can wirelessly print from my computer, just not my phone. If I could figure out how to get both my phone and the printer on the same band, it would work.<br/><br/>Update 2: I am very impressed with the "starter" toner cartridge that came in the box. I have printed a lot and it still says that my toner is full. With the inkjet printers I had in the past, I would already be needing to buy more ink by now. I am so happy with this purchase.<br/><br/>So it's been 11 months of printing and it still says I have just over half of the starter toner left. Maybe I should've waited on ordering that extra toner I thought I would need right away. I hope it won't be bad by the time I get around to needing it.<br/><br/>Pro Tip: If you're having trouble installing the software and can't figure out why it won't work, make sure you don't have a VPN on.</span>

<span>Print quality is fine but have not tried pictures yet. Setup was easy except for figuring out how to scan from the computer, I had to go looking for the software. Our 2 complaints about this printer: 1) It is LOUD. The printer is right behind my desk and I can't hear my customer on the phone if the printer is doing anything. 2) It keeps turning itself off. You would think it should have some kind of standby mode, but instead every time we need to use it it is off and we need to hit the power button on the device before we can do anything.</span>

<span>I just received a PIXMA G6020 from Amazon and wanted to provide some information given the disparity of reviews I saw prior to making the purchase. This review is only about the initial process of setting up and printer performance.<br/><br/>Set up<br/>Some of the reviews mentioned difficulty in setting up wirelessly, and I thought I might provide some details for potential consumers. First, Canon still provides a hard copy step-by-step instruction booklet which is helpful. Within the booklet are scan codes that can be followed or a web address to see a sequence of photographs that walk you through the setup process. I used this because some of the pictures in the manual were difficult to discern, but the photographs were very clear.<br/><br/>Once the machine is set up and plugged in (no cables attached to any computers), Canon provides a web address which is very clean and easy to negotiate. A clearly marked “set up” button takes you to a page where you select the kind of machine you have. You’re supposed to enter some letters, but none of these are PIXMA. That was a bit confusing, but scrolling down you can see a G020 button and clicking on that opens up a window with a start button and a picture of the printer so there can be no confusion.<br/><br/>Clicking on the start button begins the process of setting up from the pictures I mentioned above to downloading the drivers and joining the printer to the wireless network available in your home. The process went very smoothly with little input from me until an error message appeared which was associated with my Internet security system blocking the printer from the network. Importantly, there is a window from Canon during the setup process that warns you of this before it happened. As a quick aside, the hard copy manual was clearly adjusted to include anticipated problems people might have because there are several places where warnings about problems (both Windows and Mac) occur with suggested resolutions. I was impressed by that because often a set of documents are prepared and released without any consideration of problems consumers might have on their different systems. Anyhow, clearing the security issue, the download completed, and the printer was available on my computer already set up as the default.<br/><br/>The wireless connection to my home network worked great. As I headed downstairs away from the printer and our router to our second computer, the process went equally well and again the printer was available for function on the second machine.<br/><br/>Scanning<br/>Canon provides “IJ Scan Utility” as a rudimentary scanning software that allows you to direct the printer to scan documents or photographs. If you are scanning documents, multiple sequential scans are permitted (no document feeder, so you have to change the scanned pages yourself). These are combined into the same PDF when you save them. Both documents and images are by default loaded into a default Windows temporary documents folder which gratefully pops open when you are done. Otherwise, you would have no idea where your documents or images went. That’s a bit of a drawback because I could not find a way to change the default download folder, but since it opens, a quick drag-and-drop remedies the situation.<br/><br/>Printing and copying<br/>I agree with the other reviewers that the panel on the printer should’ve been backlit because it’s hard to read. Printing quality is good and fast, although I did not try any pictures. The copying function is simple as well. Just put the document on the scanner and click either the “black” or “color” button on the panel of the printer itself to produce a copy of the document.<br/><br/>Bottom line<br/>At least initially, this machine was exactly as advertised. It was straightforward and easy to set up, contained warnings and resolutions where they expected you might have trouble and then produced high quality printed documents. Some may not like that you have to interact with Canon via the web to get everything set up wirelessly, but to me it seemed like a really good way to ensure the process went smoothly which was the case for me.<br/><br/>Hope this helps everyone if you’ve been on the fence about what printer to buy given the many bad reviews that this and less expensive printers have. So far, this one completely met my expectations. If the machine fails in the future, I will update the review.</span>

<span>So after having Canon printers from way back in 2003 for a few years and getting excellent results and pictures (using the Canon high gloss photo paper back then) i switched to Epson when it died a few years ago. The Epson WF 4730 and most recently when that died the WF4740 (which also just died) I decided to go back to Canon again. I REALLY like the Megatank system. This printer has a pretty small footprint too as far as it's size compared to the Epson we just replaced.  It seems like it will be a lot more efficient on ink and the replacement bottles are really reasonable (on Amazon colors are only $11/each and slightly more for the black ink which is a larger bottle). The text prints fast and the colors are spot on. Haven't tried pictures yet but will update my review when I do try printing them. The only gripe I have with this printer are a couple of things. First, the LCD screen is small and doesn't light up making it basically useless. But, I have learned after having a few printers over the years I never use the bloatware by the printer company anymore. I use the print application on my Imac or Windows computer. Much faster to access and works better with less headaches. And, second, the operating panel which folds out HAS to be open when printing. This is good and bad at the same time. Annoying if you are in another room and want to print and forget to fold out the panel first (panel can be left forward position to print always or just pop it out when you want to print something. The good thing about the panel having to be open is if I leave the printer cover on the printer and someone wants to print from another room (and they haven't opened the control panel first) the printer won't print and jam up papers because the printer cover is on.  Scanning so far works great on this All In One. Haven't tried faxing yet and basically....who needs to fax anymore anyway. I scan and email any document. I can tell you even though Epson has their own tank version of printers (Ecotank) I am done with Epson for awhile. Best thing about Epson was the speed of print....that was it as far as superiority. The Canon so far has been a great machine. By the way, using the computer to print rather than the bloatware supplied by either Canon or Epson is not only fast to use but a lot easier when setting the printer up. So, after only owning this printer for less than 2 weeks (but we have used it quite a bit as my wife and I are both working at home during the Coronavirus quarantine) I can say that I would highly recommend this AIO to anyone looking for a great, fast and do all printer that is efficient on ink as well. I used to HATE running out and having to run to Office Depot or ordering online for ink only to have to spend about $38 for a small color ink cartridge for the Epson. The whole kit of 3 colors with black was about $125...crazy expensive. This computer comes with 3 colored ink bottles (enough to fill each of the 3 colors once) and 3 slightly larger black bottles (one fills it up and 2 extra bottles are included). I read all the reviews on Consumer Reports online as I subscribe and a lot of them pointed to the lower priced models by Brother or HP. The problem with the Brother printer they recommend (while easy on using the ink) was that the reviews stated that color printed papers came out very dull and light on color. Thus the "efficiency" of using ink on a Brother. Not like that with this Canon at all. Colors are superb on regular bright white paper. You definitely get what you pay for here. A top of the line refillable tank AIO printer that does everything very well....including saving money on ink (and the convenience of storing extra bottles to refill when needed). Spend a little more now on a great Canon G7020 but save in the long run. Hope this helps anyone who is on the fence about which printer to buy. I know even with having the Consumer Reports information online to view I spent a few hours doing research on the all around best printer. Oh, and also the print heads (2...one for colors and one for B&amp;W) pop in easy when setting up and that means replacing if ever needed should be easy. Hopefully I won't have to for a very long time though. Just buy this printer.....I can't imagine you'll regret it. I also purchased a NON Canon product that I would recommend as well. The semi-clear printer cover by Comp Bind is great. Made for this printer it keeps dust and anything else out of the printer when not in use. I truly believe using a cover extends the life of your printer too.</span>

<span>The lack of remote printing is the biggest weakness of this printer. This is common in Canon printers, so far as I can tell. There is no option to email to the printer, as there is with Epson and HP. Yes, I recognize the lack of security in e-mail, but I email to print Spanish vocabulary lists and knitting patterns I found online. I thought perhaps the Selphy app (more on that later) might solve this, but no, if the tablet and printer are on different networks, the app won’t print.<br/><br/>The app is, itself, another weakness, except in one thing – setting the printer up on wifi. The app can easily connect to the printer, link to the wifi the tablet or phone is on, and simply ask for the password. After that, wait a moment and it’s done. On the downside, the app won’t let you swap between single and double sided printing on a document basis. This is handled with a simple option in Airprint (again, more in a moment). Most of the maintenance options in the app do nothing but redirect to the printer’s web page, which is a pain to log into as the login often fails for no clear reason. It’s easier to do it on the printer’s screen.<br/><br/>The maintenance on the printer’s screen, on the other hand, is quite simple and efficient. I’ll say the excellent design here easily offsets the flaws in the app.<br/><br/>The print quality is the biggest strength of this printer. I use this to print photos for a scrapbook, so I need a quality print, and this does an excellent job of it. The colors are good. The printing is clean and sharp. The printing is quite fast, especially when it’s just text.<br/><br/>The ink tanks are the main selling point here, and of course, they are excellent. They’re easier to fill than any I have had before. Simply press the bottle onto the ink chamber, let the chamber break the seal on the bottle and it will make a solid seal and the ink will flow right down. The chambers each hold an entire refill bottle, and for the black ink especially, that’s quite large.<br/><br/>I have seen some modern Canon printers with the same mega tank capabilities that, for no clear reason, can’t support Airprint. To anyone who has any concerns about that, this supports Airprint with no issues.<br/><br/>I have seen some modern Canon printers that advertise being capable of double-sided printing, but the execution of such is that the user is instructed to print the first side, take the paper out, turn it around and print the other side. Granted, this is double sided, but I’d argue every printer is capable of that sort of double-sided printing. This printer handles it properly in the classic sense of it pulls the paper back in by itself to print the reverse side.<br/><br/>This printer is not without its flaws, but I would say on balance it is excellent. If remote printing is critical, you might look elsewhere, but if you are only going to print while on the same network, there is a lot to recommend this one.</span>

<span>I had an Epson printer that was very elaborate and sophisticated. I got it because of its high quality photo printing.

<span>This HP's had no issues so far. I was reluctant to get another HP after the last one I had a couple years ago, which had a really clunky and frustrating software package, combined with poor print quality. But then I replaced that with a Canon that couldn't get though five print jobs without jamming, and finally an Epson that had even worse print quality. After the Epson locked up because I dared to use non-Epson ink cartridges, I decided to give HP another chance. Glad I did.<br/><br/>So far, I love this printer. It was fairly easy to set up, but did take some figuring to do it without installing all of HP's software, which was my primary issue with the last HP I had. I eventually found HP's EasyStart installer on their website, and from there it was easy to select the options and software I wanted to use. I went with a very basic install and haven't had any problems with the software other than having to delete a few random new desktop icons.<br/><br/>After setup, it was like...having a normal printer! Refreshing. No jams, no stripy print jobs, no weird apps with a bunch of essentially useless features popping up when you just want to print something. I haven't had a printer that worked to an acceptable basic standard in years. The first thing I printed with it was a shipping label and was like "Whoa, a normal printout!" The second thing I printed was some instructions, and the text is comparable to a laser printer. It's also fast.<br/><br/>There are a couple other features that I like, starting with the icy-blue output tray light. It's calming and makes me feel like this printer's got it handled. Between that and the pleasant sound effects it makes for various functions, it feels like getting a little something extra. It doesn't have a touchscreen, but it does have a lighted icon-pad, which in my opinion is all a printer really needs. Lastly, though the printer has a wider footprint, the paper tray is contained and concealed; you pull it out from the output tray deck, insert paper, and push it back in. No awkward paper tray extensions or paper sticking out of the top.</span>
