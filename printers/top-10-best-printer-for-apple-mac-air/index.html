<span>It's a good printer to print photos. However it is not good for cardstock as the images print dull on the thicker paper.<br/>Printing speed is low as well.<br/>And you need to download 2 apps in order to scan documents.</span>

<span>You cant go wrong with Cannon, many say it is hard to set up, it was a breeze even connecting to wifi.  Many complain about the starter ink only able to print a few pages, so far, i've printed 8 Amazon return labels and a complete word document with the ink included and still more to spare.  Great bargain.  I've tried other brands in the past, but nothing compares to Cannon.  UPDATE  I've had it for over a month now.  I had to scan a photo and accidently printed it in full res blown up on 8 x 10 photo paper.  I've printed a 25 page document,  in addition to the things i mentioned above, I still have over 50% of the factory supplied INK.  Love  Cannon  UPDATE - Still using factory supplied ink  Well, its a few weeks later and am printing some photo's, I finally have to replace the ink, so all in all what I can say about the Cannon Printer  BUY IT!!!!</span>

<span>So far this is perfect for my wife and I being college students and having other print needs occasionally. Unfortunately, the seller didn't package it in an external box and rather shipped it in it's Canon packaging. It arrived rather beat up with a couple holes in the box and some minor cracks in the most exterior part of the lid of the scanner. I reached out and they didn't seem to care but it doesn't impede the function at all so I suppose I can't be too salty. I'm not sure yet about longevity but hopefully it is a good ink saver because ink is not cheap! It was really easy to set up wirelessly for both of our computers and works like a charm. I have yet to print any photos but plan to soon.</span>

<span>Light weight and compact enough to not get in the way. Prints fast for me. Easy to assemble but to setup you will need to install the App on your phone or PC for it to work. If you have trouble printing right with Windows 10 it is due to MS update and there is a patch for it, the link in the app so you can install the driver. Wireless and you can print from anywhere to the printer. Also an option for HP+ and Instaink so they send you ink when you are low before you run out, you pick your plan on how many pages per month you use or change it whenever. Never run out of ink. The basic low end is only 99 cents a month!  You can choose to opt out of it. Cannot comment on durability and life because I just go it the other day. But with HP+ there is a 2 year warranty included.</span>

<span>For the price, and for a home printer that’s occasionally used, it meets our needs. I got this printer a few weeks ago and it did take some time (an hour or so) to connect it to my laptop and cell phone (for the remote printing capabilities). I am not tech savvy, and I did get frustrated during the process. It also lures you in with “ink for 6 months!”…more like 1 month. I print the occasional paper for my kids school, a recipe here and there, and maybe a few sheets - it’s out of ink and I’d guess I’ve used 30 sheets. Definitely not 6 months worth, and definitely not if you’re using it as a primary printer. I’m disappointed because I think that was false advertising. For what I need it for, what it does and the cost, it’s fine for our home desk option. Don’t purchase if you’re using it for college kids who will need to print a lot, or for business/office use; you’ll run out of ink constantly. Let’s also mention the ink is $30…after 1 refill, I’m going to donate the printer and buy something else, or else I’ve spent more on ink refills than the device cost!</span>

<span>It prints so it's fine. I don't like it as much as my old one so I'm a little bitter. But the old did randomly die so maybe it's not that great. The paper tray is smaller so I have to reload more often. The screen/button area isn't super user friendly or intuitive.<br/><br/>You have to set-up through the app or a computer. They recommend the app, I hate having to download an app for set-up but it does work much better. Set-up was fine, pretty straightforward. If you have any issues/problems with the printer you solve them through the app or a computer it seems. The printer itself isn't much help. My printer randomly was having issues connecting to the wi-fi. I had to re-download the app after trying on a computer to fix it. I tried for like an hour and was about to return it (2 days left to return) when I tried one last thing - restarting my router. It worked. It's frustrating but I guess now I know. None of my other devices had issues so it's weird.<br/><br/>The print quality is fine, I've only done paper though. Double sided printing is annoying. You print the first side then turn the paper and put it back in so it can print the second side. Instructions pop up on my screen whenever I choose this option. However, if you already have more paper in the tray it'll automatically print on a second sheet. So you have to take all the paper out before printing double sided.<br/><br/>I keep getting errors when I print, it'll flash E 2 or something. Everything prints fine so I don't understand why it's giving me an error message.<br/><br/>I signed up for Instant Ink since it was free. Everyone recommends keeping it. It is super convenient to not have to think about ordering it. It just gets sent to your house automatically. You'll have to remember to cancel if you don't want to pay for it since you have to put payment info to get started. Starts at $1 a month, next tier is $4/month.<br/><br/>Overall, it's fine. It's relatively affordable and gets the job done. My old printer worked so much better and had better features for a similar price. Of course the new model is a lot more expensive so I opted for this one.</span>

<span>EDIT: 092122:<br/>First time I tried to print something since July, where it took over an hour to get it to print.<br/>AND GUESS WHAT?  PRINTER NOT ONLINE AGAIN!!!  NEITHER DEVICE (Air print my a. )..<br/>I’ve already killed 10-min rebooting and power cycling devices and printer, then trying to print again from both devices..<br/>SAME!!! (As back in July when it took me over an hour to print some thing), I find myself contemplating chucking this thing in the garbage.<br/><br/>Knocked off another star, and I’m very comfortable now with 1-star being where it belongs..<br/><br/>Because with todays technology the darn thing should stay connected, or at least connect back up without an hour of troubleshooting..  I don’t care if it’s my 5G router front-mobile, or whatever..  “because” other devices like my (Roku) for example is always connected (at least 98% of the time..  and e]when it’s not a power cycle and it’s working again).<br/><br/>Again, if I really needed to print something, it would be quicker driving to the Kinko’s that is 25 min away (50-min round trip)..<br/>Totally worthless to casually print a shopping list for example..  I’ve gotten in the habit of not even bothering (because I expect it not to print).<br/>This is unacceptable..<br/><br/>[older edit]:<br/>Hovering b/t 1-2 stars..  2-stars because people more likely to read..  There is no reason it needs to be this hard to print something..  Because my phone and iPad always connect to my internet router..  so does my (Roku)..  Same for my old router (phone &amp; (Roku) and oaf all 3, connected permanently and never forgot their connections)..  My work laptop connected to the router no problem..  Wi-Fi printing should be settled technology by now..  This printer was advertised to work with apple (AirPrint), so what’s the problem?  I give up..  If it continues to be a PITA; I’ll eat the $150..  it’s going in the trash..<br/><br/>EDIT: 070422:<br/>SAME OLD SAME OLD..<br/>Over an hour to print today (last time 3H troubleshooting)..<br/>GOOGLE Always has the same list of things to check and recheck over &amp; over again until the COWS come home (same WIFI, not in airplane mode, etc).<br/><br/>Now neither my phone or pad can see the printer.  I power cycled pad, phone and printer.. no change.. I went in and made sure IPV6 was set to no (no change).  I hope I’m not in for another 3-HOURS of troubleshooting like last time.  I guess I’ll try typing in the darn Wi-Fi password again on the printer (THAT TAKES 20-MINUTES at least .. because it’s a four word password.. and I only gave devices.. cannot plug in a laptop).<br/><br/>Confirmed, the darn printer forgot the damn Wi-Fi password again (same as it did two days ago)..  It’s a P.I.T.A! to type in that long Wi-Fi password with two buttons (I think it forgot the password because the field was blank, and after I typed it in again, it connected to the router immediately).  EDIT: I think I entered the password again because the interface made me believe there was no password (if the green light is not flashing, I now believe it’s connected)<br/><br/>NOW COMPLETELY DIFFERENT TROUBLE (from last time);<br/>Now neither phone nor pad can see the printer..<br/>If they can’t make a printer that works wirelessly, you think there would be a port so you could run a darn USB cable across the floor or something..<br/><br/>Also I’ve been getting the low toner message, and I barely used the printer (I doubt I’ve printed 200 pages of normal text).  Screw this, I’m about ready to chuck this thing in the garbage and buy some other printer (before sinking more money into this thing).<br/><br/>Who the hell has time to troubleshoot a printer every time you want to print a recipe or a grocery list?<br/><br/>EDIT: 070222:<br/>3-HOURS TROUBLESHOOTING; turned ipv6 off (on the printer), and then could print from iPAD (phone was apparently working the whole time)..  I listed to an expert somewhere in the comments to turn ipv6 on to stop the deep sleep (and forgetting the wifi password), but now I’m not sure this was ever a problem to begin with..  Verified for HL-L2350DW, turned off ipv6 on the printer and iPAD printing started working immediately..<br/><br/>EDIT: (same day):<br/><br/>Changed from 1 to 3-stars (because I don’t know what the trouble is).<br/>When I looked at the printer it remembered the Wi-Fi name, but the password field was blank..<br/>It took 20-min to type in that 4-word Wi-Fi password (with the two buttons)..  And it connected immediately.<br/>So PROBLEM; forgets that long password..<br/><br/>But I just now figured out it prints from iPhone, but not iPad (both are new models up to date software).<br/>So maybe it’s apple screwing he instead of brother (2H of my life this session I’ll never get back)..<br/><br/>So I bumped it up to three stars..<br/><br/>[original]:<br/>A PRINTER HAS ONE JOB (1-star)!<br/>It always takes AN HOUR OF SCREWING AROUND to get it to print anything..<br/>It would be quicker to drive to kinkos..<br/><br/>Why am I blaming the printer?<br/>Because I see amazon reviewers with the same problem, and I see hundreds of people with the same problem in apple help communities ie: “I have this problem too” button)..<br/><br/>When I do finally get it to work it’s a mystery how it got fixed..<br/>So every time takes the better part of an hour (and sometimes I just give up trying)..<br/>It would be easier to write my grocery list by hand..<br/><br/>Darn thing is always offline, and defies all attempts to get it online again..<br/>If it were only a one time setup I’d get over it, but after a few months a “CLEAR” pattern has formed;<br/><br/>I’m using apple devices (AirPrint), and successfully connected the printer to both my old router, and my new router.. I suspect the problem is it drops its Wi-Fi connection to my router, but that’s the last thing I want to mess with because It’s NOT a joy to stand there 30+ minutes using two buttons to enter those long network passwords..<br/><br/>I dread screwing with the dreaded two buttons again, but I believe this is what it needs...<br/>It takes so damn long to type in the passwords I can’t bend over that long because I’ve had back surgery<br/>(seriously thinking about chucking this POS in the garbage)..<br/>It makes it worse I have to use a flashlight and a magnifying glass the see the super tiny LCD screen..<br/><br/>It’s 3am,<br/>I’ve got my flashlight, and I’m off now to screw with the two printer buttons again (that I’ve become much more familiar with than I wanted)..<br/>Grrrrr.</span>

The print is crisp and clear and it can print on both sides of the paper. I decided to get one for my hubby, too, since like Mom, he doesn't print often enough to prevent inkjets from clogging. The laser printer is a good solution.<br/><br/>Unfortunately things didn't go as well with the second printer. We all came down with COVID so I didn't get it set up right away. When I finally got well and motivated, I set it up for him and the printouts had a dark thick strip of ink along the left side. After trying every trick in the book. I realized that the cartridge was damaged. It was supposed to be good for I think 7000 printouts. I contacted Brother and they said because it was past the time to return the product, they were done with me. I didn't want a return. I was hoping for at least a discount on a new cartridge. but apparently fairness and customer satisfaction isn't in their policy. While I like the printer, I have great reservation about the company.</span>

<span>I have purchased several HP printers over the years and have consistently experienced HP printer setup installation problems.<br/><br/>The problem is usually due to the end user having an incompatible default browser. The setup relies upon a compatible browser to complete the setup. Using an incompatible browser will result in a partial or incomplete setup.<br/><br/>I have finally resolved my HP printer installation problems by adhering to the following procedural steps. I have consistently and successfully completed installation to both my ACER and HP desktop computers, as well as to an ASUS laptop:<br/><br/>NOTE: All these following current settings may be restored following a successful HP Printer Setup installation.<br/><br/>1) Shutdown and quit any running VPN. Configure the VPN to not run on startup before quitting the VPN.<br/>2) In your Window's Settings default apps, temporarily set Microsoft Edge as your default browser.<br/> a) In Edge's Settings, select 'Privacy, search and services'<br/>  - Set Tracking Prevention to Basic.<br/>  - In the 'Clear browsing data now' sections, click on 'Choose what to clear' and select the time range to 'all time'. Check all boxes except for 'Passwords', then click the 'Clear now' button.<br/>  - Disable 'Do Not Track' requests.<br/>  - Disable the following: 'Enhance your security on the web', 'Use a web service to help resolve navigation errors, 'Suggest similar sites when a website can't be found', 'Show suggestions from Pinterest...' and 'Save time and money with shopping...'.<br/>  - In Services 'Address bar and search' section, disable both 'Show me search and site suggestions...' and 'Show me suggestions from history...'<br/> b) In Edge's Settings, select 'Cookies and site permissions'<br/>  - Click on the 'Manage and delete cookies and site data' section, enable 'Allow sites to save and read cookie data' and disable 'Block third-party cookies' and enable 'Preload pages for faster browsing...'<br/> c) Temporarily disable any Edge browser security extensions you may have.<br/> d) Close MS Edge.<br/>3) If you are running an Antivirus app, configure the Desktop folder to be excluded from scanning.<br/>4) Close all running programs and apps. Disable or quit as many system tray apps that you may have running.<br/>5) Download to your Desktop the HP Easy Printer Setup Software - Offline Use Only. The current version is HPEasyStart-13.4.8-EN6000_51_3_4843_2_Webpack.exe. This is the only software that you will need to perform a full installation.<br/>6) NOTE: Due to the peculiarity of the HP setup installation software, several HP installation prompts will hide behind the MS Edge browser window and the HP Smart app (downloaded by Edge during the HP installation process) will minimize to the taskbar. If during the course of the HP installation the Edge browser prompts you that 'The page could not be successfully displayed', don't fret. Just minimize the browser window and click on the HP Smart app residing in your taskbar to continue on with the HP printer installation.<br/>7) Follow the HP installation prompts to its successful conclusion.<br/>8) NOTE: The just installed HP TWAIN scan driver may not be active until you reboot following a successful HP printer software installation.<br/>9) Reboot.</span>

<span>I am not a happy adapter of new technology.  When my printer finally gave out, I searched for an unused model of the same kind, no longer manufactured, and used it.  It had actually been free as an Apple Store promotion when I bought my computer.<br/><br/>But the color function never worked, so I was limited to black-and-white.  It was somewhat compatible with my newer MacBook, but I found it easier to use the older one.  Finally, I realized I needed to move forward and purchased a new printer-- which was immediately returned because it was so complicated to install and never actually worked.  So, back to the old one for a long period, until I decided to be brave and attempt a new model again.<br/><br/>Researching online the best models for my computer, I found this one was rated highly.  My previous printer was an HP and, although the quality was never quite as good as my previous model (and I can't even remember the brand), it was good.  Most important to me, it can be used with a USB connection, as I have had terrible luck with wireless anything.<br/><br/>When it arrived it sat in the box for at least two weeks, as I avoided the presumed hassle plus endless waiting for tech support.<br/><br/>I was thrilled to find out that it was actually quite easy to set up and install.  The ink cartridges separate the three colors, which of course means you aren't paying the exorbitant cost to replace a triple cartridge when only one color is depleted.  But they install as my old HP cartridges had, so not a challenge.<br/><br/>The happiest aspect is that connecting the WiFi is as simple as entering the password for the modem.  I was absolutely thrilled to find it instantly functional.<br/><br/>In fact, I did not rate the tech support for this review as I had no reason to contact them<br/><br/>I have thus far only printed, and haven't attempted to use the assorted other functions, like faxing or scanning (I have a separate scanner which I have used for years and doubt that the smaller version included with the printer would meet my needs, though it could be fine for various documents).  The printing quality for scanned photos is so-so and a bit streaky, but I only have attempted this with garden variety copy paper as a trial for modifications before taking it to be professionally printed.</span>

<span>I have owned HP printers forever.  Our old HP all in one was still going after 12 years but the scanner bed had gotten dirty and I also decided it was time to upgrade because I needed double sided printing and also the ability to print wirelessly from my iPhone and iPad.  A nearby Office Depot was closing its doors and having a big blow out sale to get rid of all its inventory so I decided to go look at printers thinking I could get a screaming deal.  I talked to one of the sales associates about my needs and she said this was a very popular model that offered all the features I want and then some.  They had it marked down from $180 to about $153 on sale.  Before I bought it I do what I always do and checked Amazon and was shocked to find that the exact same printer in the exact same package was only $99 with Prime!  I bid farewell to Office Depot (no wonder they're closing) and went right home and ordered it!<br/><br/>I have to say, so far I REALLY LOVE this printer!  First of all, it was the easiest printer to set up EVER!!  I mean, I truly couldn't believe it!  I'm a gadget tech nerd (built my own PC) and was prepared to have to spend an hour getting it all unpacked, turned on, calibrated, set up on my network and also connected to my devices for wireless printing.  That's what I'm used to.  Set up of this printer BLEW MY MIND with how simple it was!  Literally, you take it out of the box and remove all foam and plastic etc., plug it into the wall, press power, insert the ink (SO simple) and follow the instructions on screen to align the cartridges.  Once it was aligned the touch screen informed me to go to hp.com/setup to download the drivers I would need.  My computer/network automatically detected the printer and knew just what drivers I needed.  Download and setup was a breeze!  You can use the provided disk instead but I didn't even remove it from the sleeve.  The one thing I would say about HP and their software is that they tend to over do it.  My recommendation is to select the option that enables you to choose which additional programs you want installed instead of letting HP do it for you.  I always get way more than I bargain for and end up uninstalling a lot of the "bloatware" programs that I don't use that just take up HD space like HP photo etc.  I use photoshop.  There is an option for just the basic drivers that you can select.  Your printer will work just fine with those and you won't get blogged down with unwanted software.  Either way works great though.  I tried both.  The driver setup took 5 minutes.  Then I got on my iPhone and downloaded the HP ePrint app which IMMEDIATELY recognized and connected to my printer all on its own!  You can use it to print from your photos, the web, email and the cloud.  AWESOME!!!  That was it!  In about 12 minutes from the box I was completely set up, connect and printing!<br/><br/>Here are some other things I love about this printer:<br/><br/>- Fastest setup of any printer ever (yes I know I already mentioned this but it deserves repeating).  No having to manually enter IP addresses or anything like that!<br/>- Design is very sleek and modern.  I love the all black with little color screen!  It's pretty sexy as printers go!<br/>- Small/slim profile.  For everything this printer does and how well/quickly it does it, it really is quite small!  WAY smaller than my old HP all in one!<br/>- Touch screen is really high quality!  I often get frustrated with touch screens at check out stands and elsewhere because they're not very sensitive to your finger or pressing down in one spot causing a neighboring button to be selected.  That is NOT the case with this touch screen.  I find that it's very sensitive and accurate and also the display is crisp and beautiful!<br/>- AUTOMATIC DOUBLE SIDED PRINTING AND SCANNING.  HALLELUJAH!<br/>- Printing is very fast and the print quality is excellent, even and especially with photos!<br/>- I LOVE that this printer only needs one cable (unless you want to use the fax feature as well) and works so well wirelessly!<br/>- Printing from the app on my mobile devices is my new favorite thing<br/>- Unlike my old printer, this guy is whisper quiet when it's printing.  It's a little thing, but I live with an autistic 4 year old and a husband who sounds like he's calling in air support for a military strike when he talks on the phone so...sometimes the little things make a big difference!<br/>- Scan quality is really fabulous!<br/><br/>Honestly, I rarely give 5 star reviews to things, but this printer really does deserve it, from price point to set up to functionality and features.  I HIGHLY recommend this printer for all your in home office needs!  And no, I didn't get it for free or at a discount.  I paid full price for it and I would do it again!  I hope this helps someone else who is looking for an office upgrade!<br/><br/>UPDATE 1/21/17 - After a couple weeks I started having issues with this printer going offline spontaneously and the only way I could seem to get it back online to was by restarting my computer.  Around that time we also bought a Roku 4 and started having trouble with streaming.  The signal was dropping all the time.  I finally realized that it was because of our router, which, while a great work horse for many years, was getting seriously old in "tech years" and needed to be replaced.  I bought a dual band Asus router and ever since I installed it we have not only had flawless streaming but the printer now stays "online" all the time!  If you're having this issue with it going offline, I would look at your network setup before you blame the printer itself.</span>

<span>I have been a faithful HP user for the last 5 years due in no small part to their quality and reliability.  My Officejet Pro 8600 Plus (n911g) finally died after 4 years of home use. So, after doing some web searching, I decided to fall back to the highly recommended HP Scanjet Pro 6978.<br/><br/>After 3 days of frustrating effort in trying to implement the wifi printer function, I was able to successfully enable it in my new printer/scanner. Seeing and experiencing the frustrations shown in purchase reviews, I decided to take the time to layout what worked for me.<br/>The bottom line is that HP Smart was not detecting that my computer was set up to not share devices.  The basic software at the HP Customer Support web page did and corrected this.  More detail below.<br/><br/>As background, I had used HP Smart with my previous 8600 printer and became frustrated with it, so I stopped using it and started using just the basic printer software.  Also, seeing the Instant Ink “horror stories” in the purchase reviews, I was determined not to let this happen during the install.  As it turned out this latter fear was totally un-founded and I was easily able to bypass the Instant Ink offer.<br/><br/>In retrospect, I believe HP Smart is a good addition to the basic software, however, over the years my 5-year-old laptop has been subjected to a lot of additional security and other software which I believe HP Smart was unable to detect and correct. Once corrected, I plan to continue with HP Smart and believe the underlying issue was also the source of the problem I had with it with my prior printer.<br/><br/>During the initial setup, I was easily able to get the printer into my network (solid unblinking blue wifi indicator on the printer).  Where the 3 days of frustration happened was in getting the computer to recognize the printer! Once I gave up on the HP Smart wifi and other USB and ethernet solutions, I decided to go back to finding the basic 6978 software.  On the HP support web page I found a it through web link HPEasyStart_14_6_6. Using it led to another piece of software (Full_Webpack-40.16.1234_1-OJ6970_Full_Webpack) that completed the installation on my laptop. I believe I had to start an HP account for this as well as use the sharing functions.<br/><br/>What the basic software detected was that my computer was not allowing my devices to share.  Once it corrected this, the software installation went quite quickly.  I believe this unsharing was done by my security software in order to eliminate the risks of remote hacking.  I may very well go back (or have to when the AVG software scans again) and limit the sharing to only the devices I want to access the printer.</span>

<span>This printer comes with VERY FEW printed instruction sheets, which one would assume means it is simple to setup. Unbox, plug in, insert ink cartridges, connect via USB, WiFi direct or add to your WiFi network and voila!<br/><br/>Except when I plugged it in and opened the front panel to install the ink cartridges, I could hear/see the cartridge carrier shake and vibrate but it would not move to the open area to allow installation. I looked inside for one of those large red/orange tabs that sometimes secures movable components, but none were visible. I checked the instructions AGAIN - nothing. I viewed the setup/get started videos on the HP website, no mention of anything to remove.<br/><br/>Error code 3E on the panel which means 'carriage malfunction' (no surprise). Instructions on how to clear the error were about removing paper jams. Have yet to print anything, so no paper has been through it. After 30 minutes of back and forth I am ready to box it up and return it and as I turn it over, I hear a 'rattle'....hmmm.  I shake a bit, more rattle. I look inside and shake and waaay in the back, I see a small white plastic piece. I cannot reach it with my hand, so I continue to turn and shake until this piece falls out (see picture).<br/><br/>Plug it back in and the carriage centers as it should and I can proceed with installation.<br/><br/>While the installable HP printer app is well designed and easy to use, and there are numerous pages of instructions you can print by pressing buttons on the printer, HP should include just a little more information - especially about the carriage lock AND use one that is a more visible color.<br/><br/>Another potential problem is if you sign up for 'Instant Ink' - the ink delivery service.<br/>This service requires connectivity from the printer to HP using a webservice. Unfortunately, this feature was disabled by default (at least on this printer). When I tried to register I kept getting a rather innocuous error. After a bit of frustration and way too much time, I found reference to how to enable it, but using a browser to connect to the printer directly. Cool - except I was prompted for a password, which wasn't provided anywhere. None of the 'usual defaults' worked, nothing listed on the HP site/web search worked but I found mention of how to reset it to not need a password, which I did. This also reset the WiFi settings on the printer - phhht.  Fortunately, the HP software made setting that up, AGAIN straight forward, but I mean - COME ON!<br/><br/>All total, I spent approx 2hrs of frustration getting this tiny box setup when it should have been &lt;30 minutes.<br/><br/>As a result of these experiences, I rated this printer 1 for tech support due to setup issues and 3 overall.<br/><br/>For those not familiar with WiFi Direct, be aware that when you are connected to the printer you are NOT connected to your internet connection. I've had more than a few friends get frustrated by that.  I recommend you avoid it unless you have used it before. It's benefits in your average home environment is, IMO- limited.</span>

<span>This thing uses up an entire ink cartridge every time I have a small project. It’s ridiculous. I could only print 8 full page photos on one set of cartridges. I tried printing out games for my baby shower and had to order more ink just so I could finish. Whether it’s color or black it goes through ink in one session. Not worth the buy. My old printer was half the price, did more and I rarely had to purchase ink. Same company, larger printer. unfortunately after moving I couldn’t get it to connect to my phone, computer or wifi after several attempts otherwise I’d never have bought this junky printer.</span>

<span>Heads up, they give you a pinch of black ink, so I didn’t know mine was out (the readout looked like it was half full) so after trying to figure out why it wasn’t printing….I finally put in a new ink cartridge and it works well.</span>

<span>I just finished setting up the printer so far, so good. It took less than 5 minutes to connect to wireless.  The print quality is good and the compact size of the printer is exactly what I was looking for. I don’t do a ton of printing so it’s perfect for what I need. So far I’ve printed from my iPhone and iPad with absolutely no problems. I haven’t tried printing from my MacBook yet because I’m too lazy to go it right now but if there are any problems I’ll update. If you are looking for an inexpensive, compact printer for basic printing go ahead and get this one.</span>

<span>I only have a need to print anything just a couple/few times per month.  My old HP printer after 8 years would paper jam every time I used it....still excellent print quality, and it only required two ink cartridges....but it also required an open source scanner program since the old HP Vista software was no longer supported with Win10 or HP.  All of the under $150 HP printers had too many one/two star reviews for a multitude of problems...same for Canon, and did not offer any on-printer control panel LCD or LED screens to easily view, and use the different printer functions.  Most of these functions are now preformed wireless via cell phone apps, and I only need a USB connection to my Lenovo desktop computer...obviously considered old school printer use, and connectivity now.<br/><br/>This Epson XP-4105 is not the latest Epson, and I'm not a 4 ink cartridge fan, and I do notice that the overall print quality sometimes doesn't match up to HP, but again my printer needs are not critical, and for a backup computer in the basement I have a10 year old Epson that I can't remember how old the ink cartridges are, connected to a Raspberry Pi 4B computer that the Linux based operating system recognized as soon as I plugged the old Epson into the Raspberry USB port, and it prints from Google Chrome web sites, or open source LibreOffice program beautifully.<br/><br/>Both the old Epson and this new Epson XP-4105 don't seem to use excessive amounts of ink...again that's probably more due to the fact that I don't print much...I have had no paper jams with either...neither would be considered "book shelf" compact size, but only need about one square foot of desk space, both are reliable, and well made....wouldn't it be great if the same could be said of HP occasional use printers.<br/><br/>As I type this review looking at this Epson with the green ring around it's power button changing from bright to dim slowly without distraction in standby mode, I know that I made a good purchase, and it will work the next time I click the print icon....maybe next month.<br/><br/>BTW...I ordered this printer on a Saturday night, the seller had a FedEx ship notification by Sunday afternoon, and it was delivered standard Amazon shipping on Thursday.  The whole Amazon buying experience was wonderful.</span>
