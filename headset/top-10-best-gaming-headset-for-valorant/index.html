<div class="slideshow-container">

<span>Bought on 07/16/2022 and the left side audio stopped working on 08/12/2022. The contact page says that chat is available daily at below mentioned timings.<br/>AVAILABLE DAILY: 5AM TO 2AM CST<br/>I just cannot understand how a company can have the above hours as support hours. Either their website is badly managed or it is just how it is.<br/>The S/N that is on the tag does not work and so cannot raise an enquiry.<br/>On the whole one of the worst product that I bought of late.<br/>Very disappointed !!!!</span>

<blockquote><em><div class="a-row a-spacing-small review-data"><span class="a-size-base review-text review-text-content" data-hook="review-body">
<span>My boyfriend lost his headphones while moving houses, and they were a real expensive pair, with the mic that muted if you flip it up and noise cancellation. He's got a loud Jamaican family, so that was nice for him. After he lost them I wanted to buy him a new pair, but I'm unemployed, so my budget was about 30 bucks. I saw these on sale from $40 down to $20 and figured what the hell, if the headphones are crap he'll still think I'm pretty.<br/><br/>But they're decent I'd say! Especially for the money. He can still hear his family pretty clearly, but it's not like this would be able to compete with the real bougie pair he started off with. If you care a lot about that, you gotta drop more than $30. The mic doesn't flip up to mute either, like the reviews say, but the audio quality, for both input and output, is good enough for Multiversus, Valorant, and late night discord calls. Good deal!</span>

<span>EDIT: Regarding my issue of the sound not working, I think I have determined the problem to be using Chrome Remote Desktop and TeamViewer. Whenever I use those programs, and sound plays on the PC with the headset plugged into it, it seems to bypass the headset and sound comes to my PC accessing the remote PC. Going back to my PC with the headset plugged in (and closing CRD and TV completely), that is when no sound comes out and I have to unplug the USB control box and plug it back in for it to start giving sound. I do not intend to stop using either of those programs, so unless I find a fix, I am OK with having to do this. I will not knock a few points from this headset that I already think is an awesome product; as it is an issue with a program and not the headset itself and as such I will change my rating from 4 *'s to 5 *'s. These have also been great for long periods of gaming and streaming. No headaches or sore spots on my head from wearing these, even with glasses on. My voice from my stream and recordings sound great, and playing Alien: Isolation is truly a terrifying thing when these are cranking up the noises and you hear metal clanking from the alien like it is right there above you! Things sound crisp and clear to me, like voices, even in movies and YouTube videos. END EDIT<br/><br/>I bought these several weeks ago from Amazon Warehouse, thought I would save $5. I know $5 might not seem that much, but having just spent $1400 on new PC parts for my build, every dollar counts! Anyway, I am new to PC gaming, been with consoles for years. I wanted to find a good headset that would give me good sound, good mic, good fit, good build quality, and cheap. I found these actually by accident, as I was searching for Logitech's headset, initially.<br/><br/>Now, these things are awesome... (The following is updated with my edit above) When they function, which to be honest is quite often. However, sometimes when I go to use these, they sometimes stop outputting sound. I go into my playback devices and I see that it is registering them active and that sound is being transmitted, except nothing comes out of the speakers. I have to unplug the USB control box from my PC and plug it back in for them to get back to working. I also have quite a bit of trouble getting these to work consistently with my HTC M8 (more so than with my PC). I sometimes have to reset my phone for these to work and I am not sure why that is. I am not sure if it is these that are just not very compatible, as I have earbuds that work every single time. That leads me to believe that these are defective in some way. It could be that by trying to save $5, these may have just been defective from the start.<br/><br/>The mic is pretty good too. I like that it is detachable and flexible enough to get out of the way if I need it to be. You can hear yourself when you speak, you just need to make sure that, in your recording devices, you set it to listen. I really don't like this though. There is quite a big delay (maybe around 1/2 second) in you talking to hearing yourself from the speakers. The first time I tried this, I gave myself a headache. Just try to talk, expecting to hear your voice, and as you are saying one thing you are hearing what you just said, it gets very confusing for the senses! My speech became confusing, something my brain couldn't reconcile, which led to my headache (yes, an actual headache!). I am not sure if this is something that is expected when you have to do this, but I would not recommend doing this (of course, your experience may vary). There is a little rubber piece that goes over the exposed port of the mic when you detach it, from the headset, that I see being lost quite quickly. It is a nice touch to be able to cover that port, I just wish that it could have somehow been kept on the headset, so it wouldn't get lost. I still do have mine, and I keep it in the bag that comes with this headset (more on that below) so maybe I just need to keep it there unless I use these on a trip or something.<br/><br/>The fit on these things are one of the best things about this. Very snug, very comfortable and when I have my glasses on, they don't press those into my head. You can either use the leather ones or the velour. I prefer the velour, they just feel very cozy and warm and plush!<br/><br/>The build of these things, to me, do not seem to equate to a $100 price tag. That is a good thing, as these things feel like I am stealing something from Kingston! I would honestly expect to pay quite a bit more for how well these things are built. 'How can Kingston sell these for what I paid?' I keep asking myself every time I put them on! They are built with metal along the top, padded underneath to rest comfortably on your head. With several hours of gaming, they don't feel heavy on my head. The stitching in these things is fantastic, it is a nice detail, that while it may not improve the functionality, it just proves my reasoning of thinking I am stealing something from this company, but I am glad I am not! The cord quality is great, it is braided so it doesn't tangle or get easily caught on something. The cord is standard length, from the headset to the end, which can plug into many things to be used for listening. However, it is short for having it just plugged into your PC (this is not using the USB control box). If you do use the control box, which I recommend, then it adds a lot of length, letting you sit quite a distance from your machine. The control box has a clip on the back that allows you to attach it to your pants pocket, shirt, anything else, really. This is nice cos now I don't have to figure out where my controls are when I quickly need to mute, decrease/increase volume/mic, enable/disable 7.1 virtual. So with these things not functioning properly for me at times, I am not sure if it is the control box, or the headset in general (like I said earlier, I have problems getting this to work properly on my phone too. This could all be due to the fact that I ordered from Amazon Warehouse instead of brand new). I need the control box to add the extra length as my PC sits farther away than some might have theirs. The carry bag that comes with this looks to be great quality too. I expect to use it for the first time in a couple days when I go on a trip and bring these along. It is large for these to fit and keep everything that comes with it, all in one space.<br/><br/>Now onto the 7.1. I cannot comment on how well this works. Let me give you some background information. I have a hearing disability. 95% of my left ear is not working and I need a hearing aid in my right ear, which is around 70% deaf. I use these things with and without my hearing aid. I cannot use the functionality of the 7.1, which is not that big of a deal for me as I have come to terms with not being able to hear very well in general. It does, however, seem to increase the volume, which sometimes I need when I listen to movies or TV shows on my PC. So read what others have to say about that, I'm sorry I cannot do this in this review. I will say though that these things can get LOUD. Which is why sometimes I use these without my hearing aid. They really do deliver a lot of sound to my ear that works. There is an audible tone when you push the controls and it is different when you reach the max and minimum. This is a nice touch as well.<br/><br/>Finally. I am writing this review for the product I purchased from Amazon Warehouse a couple of weeks ago. Last night (3/24/15) I initiated a return for these. Do you want know what I did after that? I purchased a brand new set of these, for the original price I was trying to avoid weeks ago! That should tell you what I think of them, flaws and all, that I actually want these again. If the new pair doesn't work correctly, or like these things did, yes I will be disappointed, but it will be a minor issue for me because all of the other benefits of these things! Plus, having looked over the reviews, I see quite often that Kingston will reach out to those who aren't satisfied with this and offer help. Not many companies care once they have your money. But when I see a company go this far for those who buy their products, being a small business owner myself, I greatly appreciate this large company for acting the way they do, even if the issue isn't resolved. It speaks volumes to those who love the products of a company and to those who may not be aware of what a company offers. But offering great customer service is another great feature of this product, and one you may not find from many others.<br/><br/>Now keep in mind, all of these things are coming from someone who just got into PC gaming, there may be others out there, others that are better, cheaper, more expensive, whatever... But I am glad I stumbled on these when I did, cos I don't really want to go to another product, I love these things!<br/><br/>One last thing, Amazon is amazing! I contacted them about these and when I order the new pair last night, they offered one day shipping free! There are a lot of bad companies out there, but Kingston and Amazon are among the elite in my opinion!</span>

<span>These are pretty decent though a bit overpriced. I actually use these for work because I don't need to charge them regularly so I haven't done any gaming with these. So far the battery life seems to likely last as long as claimed having used them for about 3 weeks and still having 70% battery life left (it gives increments of 10% upon power on) since first charged.<br/><br/>Audio quality seems fine, but mic quality while great sensitivity isn't as good as better headsets like the Arctis Pro, for instance. It definitely doesn't sound as clear or quite like my voice and I'm confident this isn't the audio quality playback that is the issue here as everything else sounds fine.<br/><br/>Using these on a work system I don't have the software installed so it might solve at least some flaws with the noise cancelling and the feature that lets you hear yourself. When I have the feature to hear yourself off I am basically shouting because of the noise cancellation. I don't think in any situation the noise cancellation should either be that strong or it shouldn't have the voice feedback off basically ever. It's too extreme and I've never had this issue with other mics despite them having good noise cancellation from external noises. Even with the feedback feature on to hear myself I can tell I don't quite sound like myself and my voice comes in harsh and kind of loud causing some fatigue. Maybe I can tweak it with the software if I could use it on the PC involved but I can't and I kind of doubt it would fully resolve this issue.<br/><br/>The default ear cushions are terrible. I had to replace them with 3rd party (Wicked Cushions in this case) because they hurt too much and were extremely uncomfortably hot after even just 20 minutes. Now I can wear them for several hours straight.<br/><br/>Mic mote button and power button could be better positioned.<br/><br/>Wireless range seems decent and reliable.<br/><br/>The circular connecting joins to the red part and earcups seem likely to break at some point and are a questionable design choice. Plus, they're not very aesthetic.<br/><br/>Mic is fairly flexible and good distance from mouth while being sensitive enough to use further from mouth without issue.<br/><br/>Overall, good headset but has plenty of room for improvement.</span>

<span>I'd like to say for starters that at time of purchase, I got these for $68 used-like new. You can currently get them for $56 used-like new which is a steal. I've owned many gaming headsets over the years (Razer Blackshark V2/Pro, Razer Kraken Ultimate, Turtle Beach Stealth 600 Gen 2's, Playstation Gold Headset, etc and I've never had a product that felt this well rounded. Lets talk exterior first. The build quality is magnificent. The outside of the headset is composed of some sort of metal and a sturdy plastic. The headband is stitched leather with foam on the inside and sits very comfy on the head. Despite it being a little heavy it does not interfere with long gaming sessions. You can't fold it or turn the earmuffs like some headset's but honestly that means nothing for a gaming headset. The buttons on the headset are simple but they get the job done. They are composed of a mic mute button, power button, and volume wheel which gives you feedback when you hit maximum volume and it has a nice feel to it, almost like a scroll wheel. The microphone also has a red led indicator letting you know when you're muted or not which is nice.  Overall, you're paying for a premium product and getting a great build quality, even though it does lack some things a premium price tag brings. Which brings me into another segment, price. For 149.99, personally I expect Bluetooth, 2.4 Ghz, and a wired option. But since I only paid $68 I will not let that negatively affect my review. I would price this personally at $100-$120 max since you are only getting a 2.4 Ghz connection and the build quality is great. Furthermore, the software for this headset is pretty barebones. You can set EQ's, update the drivers, turn on DTS, and you have the option of mic monitoring. Personally this is a plus for me cause I like simple software, unlike the dreaded Razer Synapse which is just terrible. Lets get to the main topic of this headset, the sound. I have no complaints here, the audio sounds crisp and the bass is boomy. The pleather ear muffs feel great and trap the sound in and are spacey enough to where your ears wont feel uncomfortable, I don't mess with EQ unless I have to but the default sound profile sounds amazing. The surround sound stands out for me and works better than the Blackshark V2 Pros terrible THX surround. I can properly hear where every enemy is coming from and haven't had any moments where someone was able to sneak up on me. The mic is pretty standard but better than most, I do find myself having to keep it closer to my face because my teammates cannot hear me sometimes but that's probably just me. Conclusion: If you are looking for a headset that won't break the bank, has excellent build quality and superb sound, look no further. For $56 used-like new, you are getting one of the best deals of your life. Thank you for reading!</span>

<span>My experience - I watched tons of video reviews, read headset guides and everything I could after I decided to go wireless. I've been avoiding wireless headsets for a while, because the performance to convenience trade off was just never there. Either the battery would die too often and need to be recharged, or the audio quality was complete garbage.  These are by no means an audiophile grade headphone, but I would definitely consider them to be above average for most listeners/consumers. I haven't tried a wireless set personally in 3 years, and the last one I tried was bad. The sound quality was bad, battery life was bad, it was all around a horrible experience and I returned them right away.<br/><br/>What/Why I'm replacing - I came from Audio Technica ADG1X headset that I've had for about 2 and a half years. They have been a great headset, although at a price point of $300 they should be.  They were light, comfortable and sounded great. However, I've since moved from a small house in the country to a condo and while I like the large sound stage you get from open back headphones hearing my neighbors and other people around me isn't ideal while gaming or listening to music. The headset was getting a little worn out and my cable is constantly twisting and getting caught under my chair or on my keyboard so I decided it was time for something new and began investigating wireless to see if the technology had come along for headsets as it has for mice (my Logitech G Pro Wireless mouse is a dream).<br/><br/>Look/Style - These HyperX Cloud Flights haven't been out long but clearly HyperX put in the time and research because they just got it right. I've seen several reviewers talk about them not looking cool or flashy enough and flagging that as a negative but in my opinion it's a bonus. You can't even see the headphones when they are on your head. Maybe it's a concern if you're streaming but even Shroud uses these headphones and they look fine. I love that they don't attract a ton of attention.<br/><br/>Battery Life/Buttons/Drivers - I've only had these for a few days but I've yet to run out of battery since the initial charge. I use them with the LED lighting off, because I can't see it anyways when I'm wearing them. The mute button is brilliantly placed and easy to get to, the mic is so easy to detach when you don't need to communicate and would rather not have something in your face.  The setup was extremely simple, although they do offer drivers/software you can download to customize further but I prefer the driver-less plug and play functionality and am glad that I can use these without that extra software. All of the controls/buttons are easy to reach and easy to use. FYI, the volume wheel controls the volume for Windows. The headset doesn't have a separate volume wheel. I actually enjoy and prefer this, because my ADG1X had it's own volume wheel (which causes audio to cut out sometimes) that even when working properly I would accidentally brush against and change my volume.<br/><br/>Comfort - Especially important since we tend to wear gaming headsets for hours on end. Several of the reviewers I read or watched said these were the most comfortable headphones they'd ever worn. I was still hesitant to buy into how great they would feel for the sole reason that my ADG1X were extremely light, and amazingly comfortable. I'm happy to say that HyperX got this right too.  I definitely feel a little more airflow with the ADG1X which is expected since they are open back, but my ears never got sweaty with the Flights and they were surprisingly lightweight for being a wireless headset.  The free feeling of no wires dangling down to your shoulders/chest is quite amazing. It would be extremely difficult if not impossible to go back at this point.  My ADG1X had 53mm drivers and the cloud flight have 50mm, but for some reason the actual cups on the ADG1X were a lot bigger and completely round. Whereas the Flights are more ear-shaped and not quite as large. This makes them feel smaller on your head which is a good thing, turning your head doesn't feel quite as cumbersome.<br/><br/>Sound - At the end of the day nothing else about a headphone really matters if they sound like crap. As I mentioned before, these aren't audiophile grade headphones, although I don't think any audiophile would even consider a wireless headset so it's a moot point.  You DO lose a certain level of audio quality by going with wireless over a wired connection. Just like you lose some connection speed going from ethernet to WiFi. For most people, this isn't an issue and the sound quality on the Flights is more than good enough to make the convenience of wireless 2-way audio with 30 hour battery life worth it.  Technically my old headset (audio technica ADG1X) WAS an audiophile grade headphone, although I didn't use a DAC, amp, or even a soundcard with it to truly push it to its capabilities.  That being said, I love the way these Flights sound. I'm actually hearing certain details now that I couldn't hear with my open back headset just due to noise isolation alone. Music overall sounds fuller since the bass is more prevalent (not overblown or shoved down your throat, but it was practically non-existent on my ADG1X). The highs and mids aren't as nicely detailed as on my other headphones but its' nearly impossible to tell without listening back to back and comparing, looking for a difference. The microphone is quite good as well, the people I play with on a daily basis couldn't even tell I was on a headset that cost nearly half the price of my old one. The few that I asked about it said it sounds really good. Now one big concern I did have was volume. It's very common for wireless headsets to have a pretty low volume cap due to power restrictions etc.  I even read a few comments from owner's of these headphones that said they didn't get loud enough. I'm happy to say they must have had something configured wrong in their windows audio mixer because these headphones get very loud. Not blow your ear drum out loud, but they can definitely get loud enough to be uncomfortable.  I have been keeping them around 50-70% depending on what games I'm playing, and most of my games have master audio set down to 50%. So there is plenty of power. I should note that the 30 hours battery life that HyperX advertises is said to be at a 50% volume. So if you regularly keep the volume higher or maxed you won't get quite as much battery life but it should still be plenty enough that you don't have to charge mid session.  I must also say the soundstage is surprisingly better than I thought it would be for closed back phones, and you can very clearly pinpoint the direction of enemy footsteps and gun shots.<br/><br/>Final Thoughts - I highly recommend this headset. The level of performance is unmatched for a wireless headset in this price range. Everything just comes together so nicely in an easy, convenient to use package that performs like a wired headset in many ways. I was able to walk my entire condo (1100 sq ft) without losing/degrading the connection to my PC playing music. I've always considered HyperX a solid contender in the gaming headset market, but to see this as their first attempt at wireless makes me a true believer in the brand and I look forward to seeing what they come up with next!</span>

<span>I like this headset. The sound quality is great, exactly what you'd expect out of a high-end gamer headset. The volume controls the physical output level of the headset itself, it's not a soft control for the volume levels on your device, which I personally like. It's also the most comfortable headset I've worn, while also managing to fit tightly on my head. You can move around, do light exercise, lie down, etc. and it will stay snug. No complaints on the battery life. The mic quality is whatever, but that's to be expected.<br/><br/>However I write this review to explain an issue which, although not at all a big deal, is frankly inexcusable in current year. 1 month after getting the headset, on a morning right before a meeting, I found out that the headset wouldn't turn on. Normally you hold the power button for a few seconds and it turns on, but this time it just wouldn't. I tried charging it for a while, no luck. Naturally I thought the thing was defective so I contacted customer support to return it. After the usual, they suggested that I try resetting the power on the headest. Huh? Not turning it off and on again (which I obviously couldn't do), but resetting the power. I remember that was a thing you did with like, old electronics. I looked up how to do it online, removed an ear cover (which is easy to do and replace, unlike on some other headsets, so that's a plus), and inserted a paper clip into the reset hole, and boom it worked again.<br/><br/>It's nice that this mechanism was in place. It's nice that it was easy. But for an electronic made after 2010, this shouldn't have happened. How often do people have paper clips laying around nowadays? And I checked, I was using the latest firmware.<br/><br/>So in summary, great headset, just remember that we're still not in the future yet.</span>

<span>I’ve always wanted to invest in a wireless headset but I spent so much time comparing. I added this to a private wishlist of mine to watch it when a friend mentioned she uses it and she sounded amazing in Discord calls, so when it went on a major sale, I snagged it immediately. I don’t regret it! Battery life has been wonderful, sound quality is amazing. The only thing that makes me give it 4 instead of 5 stars is that it shuts itself off if it doesn’t hear sound for a set period of time, and there’s no way to override the setting. There have been times where there has been sound on my computer, but it’s like it’s not loud enough or something, because it still shuts off. And occasionally it loses connectivity to my Discord after it shuts itself off and I have to turn it off and on again several times to be heard again. But otherwise, it’s amazing and definitely worth what I spent on it.</span>

The price is good, especially if you can find it discounted closer to $50. While not an audiophile-quality headset, the sound it does put out is surprisingly good across the board. I have not been disappointed by audio from music, movies, games, or even Zoom meetings. It is slightly bass heavy, and unfortunately (unlike some of the more expensive HyperX headsets) there is no equalizer to adjust this.<br/><br/>However, if you want a simple headset that you don't need to fiddle around with, this should more than meet your needs. The flip-to-mute mic is always a welcome addition, and this one works well, with clear vocal audio. I wouldn't recommend this if you want to record podcasts, although it will certainly do in a pinch. It seems to handle everything quite well.<br/><br/>I primarily use this as a backup headset when my primary headset dies, but I'm generally surprised with it each time I put it on. HyperX software and support leave A LOT to be desired, and I wish they would work on that, but with the affordable cost combined with the audio quality from the cans and microphone, I give these a lukewarm 5 stars. 4.5 stars is what I would give this if I could give it a half-star rating.</span>

<span>This is exclusively a PC review, so keep that in mind. Your mileage may vary depending on your console. That said, most of this will hold true regardless of platform.<br/><br/>This is the first Hyper X product I've owned, and I've got to say I'm very impressed. Even at this price point, the sound quality beats out much more expensive Logitech headsets I've bought in the past.<br/><br/>These aren't ANC headphones, so there will be some audio bleed from the outside world, though at higher volumes this issue rapidly dissipates. Bass is on the heavier side, as it is with most gaming headsets, while mids and highs are well represented and not over saturated.<br/><br/>I don't use the mic much for anything (online gaming tends to be pretty toxic) but in the minor tests I've done with it, it sounds OK; it's not good, but it's not bad. I did however have an issue where the mic was extremely quiet, even at 30+db boost. I suspect this a Windows issue, but I could never figure out how to resolve it. I didn't test it on my PS4, but I assume from watching other reviews that its a serviceable, if unimpressive mic. Having to flip the mic boom up and down to mute yourself will become a little annoying, however, as there are no in-line controls for this beyond a volume slider on the right ear cup.<br/><br/>Knocking off a star for both the PC mic issues as the muting mechanism.<br/><br/>There is a DTS Headphone X two-year trial that comes with it and I strongly encourage folks to use it; it changes the sound stage of these headphones in a stellar way and everything from music, to movies, to games sounds better and has better positional audio. It's stupid that DTS X is a licensed program rather than a buy once and be done like Dolby Atmos, but that's not Kingston's fault.<br/><br/>For PC users, the extension cable is garbage. Either I got a faulty unit, or they just plain aren't good. When plugging in the headset to the extension cable, my volume drops dramatically and there appears to be a faulty connection between the cable and the 3.5mm jack on the headset itself, as if the connection isn't strong enough. I've fiddled with the wires and can't see anything specifically wrong. When plugging the headset directly into my front audio jack, everything sounds fantastic and DTS works as it should. There is a small chance that this could be a motherboard driver issue on my end, however, so take it with a grain of salt. I'm not taking a star off for this as I very rarely, if ever, will use the mic; however, for other PC users that use one frequently, you might want to consider either a different headset, or, the better option, buying a standalone mic (headset mics are often subpar, no matter what the price point).<br/><br/>Finally, this thing is lightweight, but not cheap feeling. It's all plastic construction minus the metal sliders, but it's very lightweight to the point of almost being unnoticeable on your head, even during long sessions. The memory foam ear cups are good, though the pleather exterior will heat up after a while and you may need to give your ears a cool off. This kind of cheap material is expected at this price point, but it still grates.<br/><br/>Overall, they Hyper X Cloud Stinger is a great entry level headset for $50. At the $30 I got it on sale for, and the price that it is at the time of writing this, it's an absolute steal and there's nothing else at all in that range that will even come close to this.</span>

<span>Probably my favorite headphones I ha e ever got. Only complaint is when I connect them to my phone, I have to pull down the mic and put it up again to get them to connect properly. I don’t have this issue with anything else. Just my phone. I had this with an identical previous set I had before this one as well. Highly recommend these though 👍</span>

<span>I bought this product on impulse as i was originally going to buy a cheaper alternative. Once it got here i expected it to be pretty good, it astounded me with the amount of audio customization and clarity these give, I dont use the microphone but from what i can tell its a pretty ok microphone quality, nothing to good but nothing horrible either. The only thing im unhappy about is the pleather ear pads, they shift around easily and sometimes rotate when moved slightly, the inside of the earpad looks and feels like it is about to peel of, and i feel as if you would to scratch or rub it a bit to hard it would peel the entire thing of. the outside is nothing out of the ordinary, although it is clear it will eventually peel after a bit, might buy replacements for the ear cups down the line. But this headset is a great comfortable option even with the mediocre ear pads, although the plastic feels a bit to lightweight in certain parts, its not bad enough to warrant not buying it. I just wish it had a better plastic quality. Also forgot to mention that for music its quite ok, and for gaming its absolutely amazing, you can pinpoint an enemys location just by sound queues, its saved me multiple times in valorant.</span>

<span>First and foremost the headphones are great!! Incredible audio with outstanding 360 deg spatial audio. Hands down best headset I’ve owned.

<span>The Arctis Nova Pro’s are definitely a treat for people looking for higher quality audio on PC.<br/><br/>Off the bat, these headset’s sound and feel are amazing. Much better than 99% of gaming headphones commonly used.<br/><br/>In terms of audio being 10/10.<br/><br/>These bad boys hit a 10hz-40,000kHz frequency (99% of gaming headphones on average are 20hz-20,000kHz which is double the quality on both frequency ranges) and if connected to pc, can be maximized to 96KHz/24bit audio resolution which is the beginning standard to Hi Res audio. These headsets have great sounding highs and lows with more of a focus on highs. These headset’s can be turned up REALLY loud.<br/>My only complaint is I would wish the lows (bass) were much stronger feeling.<br/><br/>Comfort is 9/10<br/>The headband and earcups are very lightweight so it sits on your head weightless and perfectly. The earcups definitely block out most of the outside sound when audio is playing. Only complaint is the headset’s material feels rather cheap since it’s mostly plastic.<br/><br/>Features is 10/10<br/><br/>You use a DAC that lets you control everything. You have custom EQ settings, Chatmix volume slider (can be used in PC with app), and mic settings like sidetone sensitivity as well as mic volume.<br/><br/>Highly recommend for sure.</span>

Entonces, si quieres estos audifonos para hacer stream estan aceptables, pero si tú presupuesto te es suficiente, debrías comprar un microfono profesional aparte.</span><span class="cr-translated-review-content aok-hidden"></span>

<span>I've been using this pair of headphones for 1.5 years now, and they've served me well. As someone with big ears, I struggled to find something comfortable after my Logitech G430s broke (the 3rd pair, don't get those). After trying many, I had to give up on finding high-value headphones where my ears wouldn't make contact with the drivers. Since these are so well made and soft around the ears, I wasn't bothered by the contact and it was easy to get comfortable. The band that sits on the head is also quite soft. The sound quality is good, the mic is fine, and these are all around great.<br/><br/>For those concerned about the thin attachments that hold the headphones together, they haven't broken on me and seemingly aren't flimsy at all.<br/><br/>My only issue with these (and it is minor) is that at a certain point along the volume dial, the volume might become much lower for one side following some static during the adjustment. This hasn't caused any real issues because anything higher and lower is fine and volume can be further adjusted on the computer to compensate so that your desired volume can be reached regardless. Still definitely recommend it, and this issue hasn't been brought up by any reviewers so it's likely just my pair.</span>

<span>Here's the real breakdown. I watched all the product review videos on YouTube and I wanted a pair of affordable headphones with decent sound quality and mic quality. Overall, good sound, good surround, comfortable. Mic needs work.<br/><br/>Fit: Oval memory foam ear pads are super comfortable and there is plenty of room so my ears aren't pressed down or uncomfortable. I also wear glasses and that has been pretty comfortable and the glasses aren't digging into my head.<br/><br/>Sound Quality: You're not going to get professional-grade audio quality given the price point, but they do come with free Razor 7.1 surround sound software and it works pretty well for gaming. Footsteps are clear and easy to distinguish.<br/><br/>Mic: This is the issue with the headset. It is not removable so it is a bit of an eyesore but I was planning on only using this headset to game anyways. But out of the box, the mic is atrocious. Absolutely terrible, Discord and in-game voice chat cannot pick anything up. What you need to do is go to your mic settings and turn your Microphone Boost up to around +20 dB in order for it to sound better. Also, many people report that the issue is the provided audio jack splitter, so if your mic problems persists, purchasing a better one may solve your issue. The mic arm flexibility is okay, but it doesn't tend to stay in the same place after positioning it and may drift back to its original position. I've also read reviews that say it weakens over time and won't be able to hold its position anymore.</span>

<span> Sorry for long review but it’s detailed and honest and will absolutely help with your decision.<br/><br/>This headset is designed for GAMING and they do just that and more, I GURANTEE you will be beyond happy with this product. ((Id like to say I’ve owned and used these almost everyday for 5 and half months)) If you’ve never owned a Razer product I promise they won’t disappoint you, you should see what your missing out on. Plus 2 year warranty and awesome customer support. I LOVE this headset and I’ve owned turtle beaches, Astro a-10’s, and I’ve tried arctic steelseries 5. Blackshark V2x is simply a better product and you should buy them.<br/><br/>1.) SOUND QUALITY: The 50mm triforce drivers should make this headset more and $50-60. With frequency range of 12hz - 28hz you get the most dynamic sound range which is crisp, clean, and defined, plus the triforce technology that no other headset has..Most headsets in the price range are usually 40mm drivers and 20hz-20hz with neodymium magnets which is basic and nothing new. The bass hits HARD and crisp with mids and treble being very clear and loud.  not a muddy/staticky  sound of all three combined. They’ve got a super wide range of volume,you can just keep turning and turning the volume nob until they are so loud but still crystal clear audio. </span>
<span><br/><br/>2.)COMFORT AND BUILD QUALITY: They are very lightweight and super easy to wear for longgg periods of time. The overall quality and feel of the headset is sturdy thick plastic, not cheap creeking plastic, with metal or aluminum adjustment sliders. The ear cushions and very soft leathery material and stays nice and firm, with the material quality being superb, so after months of use you won’t have flat, hard earpads. The actual size of the ear cups and awesome not to small to here the crush the tops of your ears they go completely around them for nice comfortable seal on the sides of your head with plenty of room for your ears.  This the kind of headset that you will forget you have on. They got the perfect clamping force to stay put and not feel like it’s crushing you, the memory foam keeps them comfortable and in place. The headband is nice and cushioned with leathery material. When it comes to adjusting it on your head it has a dirtent type of adjustment functionality. You can get precise adjustment perfect for you head. It’s not one singular piece to move it slides and 2 diffrent parts on left and right side to get the PERFECT position you like, with ear cups being able to swivel to help even more to seal around your ears and countour of your head.<br/></span>
<span><br/><br/>3.) NOISE CANCELLATION: Razer did a very good job with noise cancellation because of the memory foam ear cups that get a good seal on side of your head as I said above. My mom hates it because she can’t yell at me from living room when I have them on. They make for awesome immersive experience, only being able to hear the sweet sounds of gaming,with no background outside noise. The memory foam ear pads really help keep outside noise out. I’m assuming if they were some fabric material sound would seep through.<br/></span>
<span><br/><br/>4.)MICROPHONE QUALITY: I’ve gotten multiple compliments about the clarity of the mic, always asking what mic I have and their surprised by the answer. It’s pretty damn impressive for this headset in this price range, the mic is just as good as some “streamer mics”. I Never have problems with echoes or like static background noise. It’s literally dead quiet until you speak and it only picks up your voice. We all know if you have a ceiling fan on it can be heard when you talk. This mic doesn’t pick up that sound literally just your voice and you don’t need to have the mic super close to your mouth, can have it decently away and you’ll still sound loud and clear on the other end. Like I said it’s pretty damn impressive for the price of this headset.<br/></span>
<span><br/><br/>5.) CONS I DONT LIKE: •Microphone doesn’t flip up(blackshark V2 has removable mic).<br/>•The cord is a rubbery material and no matter what it never seems to straighten out completely, braided cord would be better.<br/>•The headset cable is not removable, so if you break it the headset is toast.</span>

<span class="cr-original-review-content">Llevo usando estos auriculares por un año y he tenido que gastar en varios extra. Los auriculares son muy buenos, pero las almohadillas son muy delgadas que lastimaban mis orejas, tuve que comprar unas nuevas que sean más gruesas para reemplazarlas, de ahí todo genial hasta que al año empezó a fallar la batería, no le duraba ni 5 minutos. Tocó comprar un reemplazo y cambiarla, me parece que por el precio deberían por lo menos incluir una batería de mejor calidad para no tener estos inconvenientes al año de uso.<br/>Por lo demás son muy buenos, físicamente se ven casi como nuevos.

<span>While I enjoy this headset for the most part, there has been some negative qualities.<br/><br/>Before I get there though, I do want to say that these are comfortable. I used them all day and my ears never hurt. I use these for both PC and console play. The sound quality is really good on all platforms I play on. The 3D audio works well for PC and console. And I have yet to receive any complaints on how I sound when using the mic.<br/><br/>Now to my complaints.<br/><br/>First, you get two different experiences based on if you use iCue or don't use iCue. For some reason if I don't use iCue while using these I get a lot of background static noise, as if it has some kind of listening mode turned on. But that's not an issue if iCue is running.<br/><br/>Second, I absolutely hate the voice assistant saying "power on" or "power off." It's unnecessary and it's annoying if you have some kind of audio running, it talks over it.<br/><br/>Third, it seems that the headset can't tell when I have audio running at times. I'll be watching a video and randomly it will say it's going to power down. I've even had this happen a few times while playing a game. So I'll be listening to something or in the middle of an online match and I hear "powering down initiated." Then I have to press the power button once to stop it and it then says "powering down stopped." That's really annoying when you're watching something or in the middle of an online match.</span>

<span>I bought this headset in December of 2020 and now in August of 2022 the wireless part of the headset is a joke. It has to be plugged in at all times and there's a very noticeable buzzing or sometimes ticking electrical sounding noise on the left ear. I know its not the side tones because I turned those off. That being put aside all other aspects of the headset still are great. It still sounds great when it works and is comfortable plus the wear on it seems to be minimal. But the technical issues definitely make me want to look towards a different headset.</span>

<span>Listen, I bought this headset about 2 years ago and have been using it on a daily basis. I use it for work where I take calls and for gaming. The sound quality is great and the mic is decent. I never had any issues with compatibility. I also used it on my PS4 and PS5.<br/><br/>Here is the one thing you should know:<br/><br/>This headset is apparently well known for having battery issues. I had a coworker who used it and it stopped charging around the same time as mine did (2 year mark). This could honestly be normal for a charging headset, 2 years is a decent amount of time but my recommendation is to go with the 3 year extended warranty. I am going to be repurchasing this headset with it this time. (Yes, I like it so much I will buy it again).<br/><br/>I tried purchasing a different headset, the HyperX Cloud II which is a modern headset but the sound quality and mic quality was not as good and it's much more expensive than this. The HyperX also has a terrible feature where it auto shuts off if no sound is coming in, the Corsair HS70 will only auto shut off if you leave the connection range and it will beep a few times as a warning before it does.<br/><br/>My current Corsair HS70 headset does still work it just can't survive unplugged. I did look into changing the battery and in the instructional video I found they pulled out a puffy battery (that is bad) and the replacement did not work until they rewired it. I am pretty tech savvy but I am not an electrician, okay? So yes I could save myself a little bit of money but replacing the battery is a no go for me. But maybe you can do it. :)<br/><br/>Pros:<br/>-Sound Quality really good (in my opinion)<br/>-Mic is decent<br/>-Comfortable, can wear for 8+ hours straight and I have sensitive ears<br/>-Wireless range is decent<br/>-When new the length of battery charge is okay but will slowly decline over time<br/><br/>Cons:<br/>-Battery will die at about the 2 year mark if you use the headset as often as I do. Around the 1.5 mark it would slowly lose more and more time off charge until now when it finally cannot survive unplugged (but still works).<br/>-It is a little heavy on the head which could bother some</span>

<span>Personally, I don't think anyone needs to be using mics that are integrated to the headphones... they're all trash, let's be real.  None of them are good.  And if you think any of them are... i dunno.. yikes ig.  Dedicated mics are so accessible and cheap.. get Q2U.. get an elgato wave on sale.. razer mini often on sale for $30-40.<br/><br/>I want a wireless headset that uses 2.4ghz and not bluetooth because bluetooth is trash.  Needs USB type C.  Needs to be light and comfy.  For me, the logitech G553 was the most comfortable wireless headset.  And I would say this is more comfy, for me. .. so if you also liked the G553, you'll probably find this comfortable as well.  I really like that there are different color options.. tired of just black and grey or w/e.  Not really fan of the two tone.  Should have just made the pads and padding the same color.  The head padding should have been the same material as the earpads.  No idea why razer used w/e that pleather material is.<br/><br/>It definitely feels "cheap" but that doesn't mean it's bad.  It's plastic.. so ofc it's going to feel light and "cheap"... that's a good thing imo.  Also.. I take care of my stuff... sooo.. not really a problem there.<br/><br/>I love how these look.. minimal.. no gaudy rgb.. no distasteful logo placement..<br/>Razer provided a great number of cables which I truly appreciate.  The USB C dongle is an odd shape, but I don't really care.. they provide a cable for it.. and I can see how this is a better shape for stability and possibly less chance of hitting it and breaking it if it was the usual long rectangle shape.  It literally weighs nothing.. it's lighter than a piece of paper.  One nice thing would be the ability to store the 2.4ghz adapter on or inside the headset somehow? i dunno.. maybe some sort of cap for the USB C male end and then that cap also has a tie cable that one can string around the headset when storing it.  I can see this easily getting lost by people who are unorganized.<br/><br/>Dunno why companies do this.. but the earcups should go inwards towards a persons chest.. not outwards... why? why do this? it's moronic.<br/><br/>for $30~.. the sound quality is fine.<br/><br/>I would definitely recommend this at $30-40 if you don't care about the mic.  Which you shouldn't tbh.  Buy dedicated.  I'd also be okay with buying this for a bit more than $40 if I really wanted them for aesthetic reasons... there really aren't a lot of nice looking white/pink 2.4ghz wireless headsets out there.  imo, these look fantastic.  Once you start looking at the MSRP of this headset ($70-100), I would NOT recommend this headset (again, unless you really want it for aesthetics which is fair) because then you're in the price range of other headsets that are much much better. and you might ask.. which ones, sir? I would say literally anything else that is selling over $100.  IMO, the barracuda x wireless headset should've been msrp at $59.99... and on sale for $29.99-39.99.</span>

<span>Please note that this review is based off of roughly 30 minutes of experience - I wanted to get my thoughts down while they were fresh.<br/><br/>Upon loading my usual playlist, I'm struck by a few things: First, bass is unusually punchy and well-tuned for a wireless headset. Second, vocals stand out very well from the rest of the soundscape, but not in a way that feels forced or unnatural. This has already lead to my detecting new vocal details in favorite songs.<br/><br/>Coming from an old pair of wireless Arctis 7s, I have to say that I'm pleasantly surprised by the sheer volume these cans are capable of putting out. Some may even find the max volume uncomfortable. I hesitate to speak to wireless consistency as I've not had the Barracuda long, but the signal has been clear and lossless so far.<br/><br/>The seal is pleasantly tight and not uncomfortable, though folks with larger ears may be better served by stepping up to the Razer Blackshark. The removable mic is a very welcome feature. I can't speak to latency yet, though a quick glance at the other reviews will tell you that other people find it to be a non-factor.<br/><br/>I already prefer these cans to my old $129 Arctis 7 headset. With that in mind, my current (and may I remind you, very early) impression of the Barracuda is a very positive one. The current price of $59.99 is a steal.</span>

<span>I am such a sucker for quality products for gaming and in pink. Razer provides both. These USBC  headphones are perfect for what I need them for. Mostly being a silly trash talking raid mom, who yells at her degenerate raidmates in discord.<br/><br/>The sound quality is crisp and clear  and I can get 20 to 30 feet from the PC before the headphones cut out. They will also auto turn off if there is no activity to them. Ie. I have my chat programs to come through headset and games to come from speakers. So if there is a long period of silence they turn off.<br/><br/>I don't have much to say about the microphone. I have it detached as I use the razer siren mini for mic. So I cant really provide feedback save...its cool you can detach it.<br/><br/>Also it works with my android cell phone when I plug into the USBC on the phone.</span>

<blockquote><em><div class="a-row a-spacing-small review-data"><span class="a-size-base review-text review-text-content" data-hook="review-body">
<span>While working from home, my Logitech on-ear headset was beginning to cause rashes on my ears from hours of continuous use.  To be fair, the maybe 2 hours of day they were used pre-pandemic when I was working in the office was fine.  However, the 8 to sometimes 12 hours a day was not working.  I wanted to find an over the ear headset but didn't want to invest too much into some of the game headsets.  I already have two Sennheiser gaming headsets which fill their role but are on the expensive side.<br/><br/>The Corsair HS60 is a good set of headphones, especially if you can pick them up on an Amazon sale.  I have a relatively small head and the headset fits snug.  The top is padded but it can start to bug you if you are wearing the headset for many hours straight (and you have little to no hair for cushion).  You can adjust it so it's not resting on your head but then the headset will lean forwards or backwards which you will feel around your ears.  I've had extended days of working and have worn the headset for almost 10-11 hours in a day.  Not continuously, but total and have had very little discomfort.<br/><br/>The sound quality is really good for the price (on sale).  No, it's not going to beat an expensive Sennheiser set, but it does not disappoint with sound quality.  I'm an avid music fan and have not been unhappy with the quality.  Keep in mind, this might vary depending on what you are using to drive the headphones.  If you have an elaborate Schiit system or something higher end, look at higher end headphones.  For normal computer and/or soundcard output, the headphones do really well and have a good range.<br/><br/>The mic is another topic.  As you can see from the pictures, the mic is not a boom mic.  It is optional to use and plugs into the headset with a 3.5mm connector.  The headset does not echo your mic through the headset.  Also, these are a close back headset.  This means you can't really hear yourself taking and sometimes has you yelling into the mic to hear yourself through the close back headset.  The other thing is that the mic reads extremely quiet in Windows.  I did some searching through online forums and found this to be common.  Even with the mic cranked to the maximum in Windows, it still reads low when you talk.  The good thing is that I haven't had any complaints of co-workers not hearing me but it does make you feel like you need to speak louder.<br/><br/>Since the mic isn't a boom mic, you can't just swing it out of the way.  You can bend it out of the way of your mouth (if you are eating or drinking) but you can't really get it out of your viewing area which may bug you.  Next, when you lay down the headset, since the mic isn't a boom mic it's a little awkward.  If you lay it forward, you have to bend the mic back.  If you lay it backwards, you will move the dial on the back for volume.  If you have a headset stand, then it doesn't matter.<br/><br/>The volume dial, this is likely the weakest part of the headset.  The volume dial is extremely easy to accidently move.  The last complaint is the USB cord.  I believe it's got a nylon coating which means it's forever tangled.  I've had similar cords before on other devices and trying to untangle and keep them untangled typically does more damage than good to the cord.  I wonder if some of the reviews complaining about the cord breaking were trying to keep it untangled.<br/><br/>Overall, for the money (on sale), it's a good product.  Don't expect $200+ headset quality for $50 (or whatever the current sale price).  I do think at $100, there are some other options out there but at $60 or less, these are good to have in your consideration.</span>

<span>The overall build of the headset is very solid. I honestly thought that it would be a bit flimsily but trying it for the first time, I was pleasantly surprised. The metal and material hold up extremely well. The microphone is also adjustable and fairly flexible. It bends in almost every direction and is very dynamic. The sound quality from it sounds very clear and thorough, great for gaming or just talking in general for Discord or Zoom calls. My only gripe with this amazing headset is that it is definitely geared towards smaller heads. The headset band is very rigid and feels very tight for someone with a bigger head like me. The cushioned earpads cancel the noise almost to perfection but they're really tight in my opinion. They clamp down really hard and it feels cramped for my ears.<br/><br/>Of course all of these issues might be completely non existent for someone with a smaller head but for a bigger person like me, it causes a lot of pain after just like 30 minutes of usage. It crunches down on my head and it pains me head after a while. Just a little note for the bigger folks in search of a head set.</span>

<span>The audio on the headphones are so loud that if you are in a voice chat or party it echos very bad, you literally have to turn it down to the point where the game volume is almost unbearable to be able to not only hear ur friends but cut off the echo. I would definitely recommend if you are a solo player looking for audio quality for your games, but if you play multiplayer I would suggest a different mic unless u have no problem with turning it down everytime.</span>

<span>I'm not picky, but most headphones hurt my ears. These ones sit comfortably around my ears. Sound quality seems better than my other audio devices. The headphones do muffle outside noise at least a little. Sometimes when I am gaming I need to reposition the mic for my friends to hear me better, but this sensitivity seems worth it. Loud noises that are away from the mic do not seem to get picked up as easily.</span>
