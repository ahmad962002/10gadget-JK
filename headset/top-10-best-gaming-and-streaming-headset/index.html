HyperX Cloud II features a newly designed USB sound card audio control box that amplifies audio and voice for an optimal Hi Fi gaming experience, so you can hear what you’ve been missing. Open up a world of detail other gamers will never know — the rustle of a camper’s boot, the scuttle in a distant vent. This next generation headset generates virtual 7.1 surround sound with distance and depth to enhance your gaming, movie or music experience. The headset must be selected as the default audio device in your sound settings. For Windows: 1. Open up Control Panel and select Hardware and Sound and then select Sound. 2. If the “HyperX 7.1 Audio” is not currently the default audio device, right click on the option and select “Set as Default Device.” 3. This should place a green check mark next to the default audio device. Repeat the same steps for the microphone portion of the headset, located under the “Recording” tab (also found in the Sound program in Control Panel.) For Mac: 1. Click the Apple menu and select “System Preferences” from the drop down menu. 2. In “System Preferences”, click on the ‘Sound’ icon. 3. Click on the Input tab and select “HyperX 7.1 Audio” for default sound input. 4. Click on the Output tab and select “HyperX 7.1 Audio” for default sound output. Note: The headset may appear as "USB audio" instead of "HyperX 7.1 Audio". Hear the rich, impactful sounds of your games with clarity and precision.
                   
                   <h4> What People Say:</h4>
<div class="slideshow-container">
<blockquote><em><div class="a-row a-spacing-small review-data"><span class="a-size-base review-text review-text-content" data-hook="review-body">
<span>I'd like to say for starters that at time of purchase, I got these for $68 used-like new. You can currently get them for $56 used-like new which is a steal. I've owned many gaming headsets over the years (Razer Blackshark V2/Pro, Razer Kraken Ultimate, Turtle Beach Stealth 600 Gen 2's, Playstation Gold Headset, etc and I've never had a product that felt this well rounded. Lets talk exterior first. The build quality is magnificent. The outside of the headset is composed of some sort of metal and a sturdy plastic. The headband is stitched leather with foam on the inside and sits very comfy on the head. Despite it being a little heavy it does not interfere with long gaming sessions. You can't fold it or turn the earmuffs like some headset's but honestly that means nothing for a gaming headset. The buttons on the headset are simple but they get the job done. They are composed of a mic mute button, power button, and volume wheel which gives you feedback when you hit maximum volume and it has a nice feel to it, almost like a scroll wheel. The microphone also has a red led indicator letting you know when you're muted or not which is nice.  Overall, you're paying for a premium product and getting a great build quality, even though it does lack some things a premium price tag brings. Which brings me into another segment, price. For 149.99, personally I expect Bluetooth, 2.4 Ghz, and a wired option. But since I only paid $68 I will not let that negatively affect my review. I would price this personally at $100-$120 max since you are only getting a 2.4 Ghz connection and the build quality is great. Furthermore, the software for this headset is pretty barebones. You can set EQ's, update the drivers, turn on DTS, and you have the option of mic monitoring. Personally this is a plus for me cause I like simple software, unlike the dreaded Razer Synapse which is just terrible. Lets get to the main topic of this headset, the sound. I have no complaints here, the audio sounds crisp and the bass is boomy. The pleather ear muffs feel great and trap the sound in and are spacey enough to where your ears wont feel uncomfortable, I don't mess with EQ unless I have to but the default sound profile sounds amazing. The surround sound stands out for me and works better than the Blackshark V2 Pros terrible THX surround. I can properly hear where every enemy is coming from and haven't had any moments where someone was able to sneak up on me. The mic is pretty standard but better than most, I do find myself having to keep it closer to my face because my teammates cannot hear me sometimes but that's probably just me. Conclusion: If you are looking for a headset that won't break the bank, has excellent build quality and superb sound, look no further. For $56 used-like new, you are getting one of the best deals of your life. Thank you for reading!</span>

<span>My experience - I watched tons of video reviews, read headset guides and everything I could after I decided to go wireless. I've been avoiding wireless headsets for a while, because the performance to convenience trade off was just never there. Either the battery would die too often and need to be recharged, or the audio quality was complete garbage.  These are by no means an audiophile grade headphone, but I would definitely consider them to be above average for most listeners/consumers. I haven't tried a wireless set personally in 3 years, and the last one I tried was bad. The sound quality was bad, battery life was bad, it was all around a horrible experience and I returned them right away.<br/><br/>What/Why I'm replacing - I came from Audio Technica ADG1X headset that I've had for about 2 and a half years. They have been a great headset, although at a price point of $300 they should be.  They were light, comfortable and sounded great. However, I've since moved from a small house in the country to a condo and while I like the large sound stage you get from open back headphones hearing my neighbors and other people around me isn't ideal while gaming or listening to music. The headset was getting a little worn out and my cable is constantly twisting and getting caught under my chair or on my keyboard so I decided it was time for something new and began investigating wireless to see if the technology had come along for headsets as it has for mice (my Logitech G Pro Wireless mouse is a dream).<br/><br/>Look/Style - These HyperX Cloud Flights haven't been out long but clearly HyperX put in the time and research because they just got it right. I've seen several reviewers talk about them not looking cool or flashy enough and flagging that as a negative but in my opinion it's a bonus. You can't even see the headphones when they are on your head. Maybe it's a concern if you're streaming but even Shroud uses these headphones and they look fine. I love that they don't attract a ton of attention.<br/><br/>Battery Life/Buttons/Drivers - I've only had these for a few days but I've yet to run out of battery since the initial charge. I use them with the LED lighting off, because I can't see it anyways when I'm wearing them. The mute button is brilliantly placed and easy to get to, the mic is so easy to detach when you don't need to communicate and would rather not have something in your face.  The setup was extremely simple, although they do offer drivers/software you can download to customize further but I prefer the driver-less plug and play functionality and am glad that I can use these without that extra software. All of the controls/buttons are easy to reach and easy to use. FYI, the volume wheel controls the volume for Windows. The headset doesn't have a separate volume wheel. I actually enjoy and prefer this, because my ADG1X had it's own volume wheel (which causes audio to cut out sometimes) that even when working properly I would accidentally brush against and change my volume.<br/><br/>Comfort - Especially important since we tend to wear gaming headsets for hours on end. Several of the reviewers I read or watched said these were the most comfortable headphones they'd ever worn. I was still hesitant to buy into how great they would feel for the sole reason that my ADG1X were extremely light, and amazingly comfortable. I'm happy to say that HyperX got this right too.  I definitely feel a little more airflow with the ADG1X which is expected since they are open back, but my ears never got sweaty with the Flights and they were surprisingly lightweight for being a wireless headset.  The free feeling of no wires dangling down to your shoulders/chest is quite amazing. It would be extremely difficult if not impossible to go back at this point.  My ADG1X had 53mm drivers and the cloud flight have 50mm, but for some reason the actual cups on the ADG1X were a lot bigger and completely round. Whereas the Flights are more ear-shaped and not quite as large. This makes them feel smaller on your head which is a good thing, turning your head doesn't feel quite as cumbersome.<br/><br/>Sound - At the end of the day nothing else about a headphone really matters if they sound like crap. As I mentioned before, these aren't audiophile grade headphones, although I don't think any audiophile would even consider a wireless headset so it's a moot point.  You DO lose a certain level of audio quality by going with wireless over a wired connection. Just like you lose some connection speed going from ethernet to WiFi. For most people, this isn't an issue and the sound quality on the Flights is more than good enough to make the convenience of wireless 2-way audio with 30 hour battery life worth it.  Technically my old headset (audio technica ADG1X) WAS an audiophile grade headphone, although I didn't use a DAC, amp, or even a soundcard with it to truly push it to its capabilities.  That being said, I love the way these Flights sound. I'm actually hearing certain details now that I couldn't hear with my open back headset just due to noise isolation alone. Music overall sounds fuller since the bass is more prevalent (not overblown or shoved down your throat, but it was practically non-existent on my ADG1X). The highs and mids aren't as nicely detailed as on my other headphones but its' nearly impossible to tell without listening back to back and comparing, looking for a difference. The microphone is quite good as well, the people I play with on a daily basis couldn't even tell I was on a headset that cost nearly half the price of my old one. The few that I asked about it said it sounds really good. Now one big concern I did have was volume. It's very common for wireless headsets to have a pretty low volume cap due to power restrictions etc.  I even read a few comments from owner's of these headphones that said they didn't get loud enough. I'm happy to say they must have had something configured wrong in their windows audio mixer because these headphones get very loud. Not blow your ear drum out loud, but they can definitely get loud enough to be uncomfortable.  I have been keeping them around 50-70% depending on what games I'm playing, and most of my games have master audio set down to 50%. So there is plenty of power. I should note that the 30 hours battery life that HyperX advertises is said to be at a 50% volume. So if you regularly keep the volume higher or maxed you won't get quite as much battery life but it should still be plenty enough that you don't have to charge mid session.  I must also say the soundstage is surprisingly better than I thought it would be for closed back phones, and you can very clearly pinpoint the direction of enemy footsteps and gun shots.<br/><br/>Final Thoughts - I highly recommend this headset. The level of performance is unmatched for a wireless headset in this price range. Everything just comes together so nicely in an easy, convenient to use package that performs like a wired headset in many ways. I was able to walk my entire condo (1100 sq ft) without losing/degrading the connection to my PC playing music. I've always considered HyperX a solid contender in the gaming headset market, but to see this as their first attempt at wireless makes me a true believer in the brand and I look forward to seeing what they come up with next!</span>

<span>Let me just start this off by saying I never leave reviews. I'm not very easily impressed. I usually buy something, receive it, and carry on with my day. However, I've had these for over two years now, and it only just recently dawned on me how much of an anomaly this headset has been compared to others I've had in the past. In the hundreds, if not thousands of hours I've used this headset for, not once has it ever consciously occurred to me that they're being worn while in use. You slap them on out of the box, adjust the earcups to your liking, and then forget they're there. These things are so damn comfortable that I regularly forget I'm wearing them when I leave my apartment to go do other activities. I can't sing its praises enough in terms of comfort, since it feels like wearing nothing at all once properly adjusted.<br/><br/>As for the sound quality, it's pretty damn good. I've never really been much of an audio snob, but this is more than sufficient if you're just looking for something with quality sound. I've used them for everything from games to podcasts, and there has never been an instance where I was underwhelmed in any capacity by the sound quality here. Absolutely zero complaints from me in this department. The noise cancellation is pretty good, too. I mean, it's not gonna completely tune out anything and everything, but background noise is definitely reduced. My apartment's AC is only about ten feet from my desk, and it gets to be decently loud at times. Though the noise from it is still noticeable when wearing them, it still becomes maybe 30% quieter; even at that close a range. Get sucked into a game, movie, podcast, or album wearing these, and you'll soon forget about any white noise going on in your immediate vicinity anyway. You can also buy HyperX's 7.1 surround sound USB adapter to beef up the sound a bit should you so choose, but I mainly use it for additional volume control and ease of use instead of the surround sound. Maybe I'm using it wrong, but it's just never worked for me.<br/><br/>If you're sometimes rough with your peripherals like me, you probably are looking for something that can take a bit more punishment than most. Rest assured you won't be disappointed here, because this thing's rock solid. Just off the top of my head, my Cloud Alpha has survived:<br/><br/>-Being slammed in the heavy wooden door leading to my apartment<br/>-Being slammed in a car door<br/>-Being accidentally rolled over at least two dozen times by sixty pound steel office chair<br/>-Being tossed onto hardwood flooring when I missed my intended target of the couch more times than I can count<br/>-Being dropped six feet onto solid concrete<br/>-Being stepped on at least two hundred different times<br/>-Being vomited on on more than one occasion, though that can probably be attributed to luck more than anything else<br/><br/>Seriously, there are times when throw this guy around and have the headband pretzel in a concerning fashion, only to pick them up again, put them back on, and continue where I left off none the worse for wear. Every time I'd get a little alarmed at the aggressive way that I'd just manhandled my headset, it'd be a completely irrational fear. Barring smashing these things with a hammer or actually trying to bend the headband 180 degrees in the opposite direction, there's no conceivable way to me you could break these in day to day use. I've included a few pictures of the wear and tear they've accumulated over the years, as well as the lengths to which they regularly bend just to give you an idea of the punishment they can take. Believe me when I say the build quality is second to none.<br/><br/>Now, at this point you know the headset itself is durable, but you might still be wondering about the cable used to connect said headset to your preferred device. Wonder no more. The included cable is 48 inches of (what might as well be) braided steel, and in my two years of usage, it's accumulated nary a scratch save for a small, nearly nonexistent kink below the volume control. It's detachable too, so you never have to worry about the annoyance and potential stress point that comes from having a cable permanently anchored to your headset. I've coiled this thing up all sorts of ways, tossed it into my pockets and backpack in a ball, and it's none the worse for wear considering. Even if you DO somehow manage to break the cable or render it otherwise unusable, don't worry; it can be replaced with any other 3.5mm audio cable with zero hit to sound quality. Trust me. I've checked.<br/><br/>My only real gripe about this product is that my microphone has never worked; even brand new out of the box. I've since bought a replacement mic that also hasn't worked either, so my guess is that it's a manufacturing defect rather than something that broke during use over the years. This is really only something that you should think about if you don't already have a mic and/or will be using this mainly for games. Even if yours also turns out to be broken, I'm sure the folks in customer support would be more than willing to exchange your defective set for a functioning unit.<br/><br/>But yeah. This has got to be the best headset I've ever purchased in the ten odd years I've been using them. The price is a bit steep compared your standard headset fare, but the price of admission is well worth it. I've used these things so much that the pleather on the earcups is starting to peel off, and I'll continue to use them until I literally can't anymore, for whatever reason that may be. Can't recommend them enough.</span>

<span>These are pretty decent though a bit overpriced. I actually use these for work because I don't need to charge them regularly so I haven't done any gaming with these. So far the battery life seems to likely last as long as claimed having used them for about 3 weeks and still having 70% battery life left (it gives increments of 10% upon power on) since first charged.<br/><br/>Audio quality seems fine, but mic quality while great sensitivity isn't as good as better headsets like the Arctis Pro, for instance. It definitely doesn't sound as clear or quite like my voice and I'm confident this isn't the audio quality playback that is the issue here as everything else sounds fine.<br/><br/>Using these on a work system I don't have the software installed so it might solve at least some flaws with the noise cancelling and the feature that lets you hear yourself. When I have the feature to hear yourself off I am basically shouting because of the noise cancellation. I don't think in any situation the noise cancellation should either be that strong or it shouldn't have the voice feedback off basically ever. It's too extreme and I've never had this issue with other mics despite them having good noise cancellation from external noises. Even with the feedback feature on to hear myself I can tell I don't quite sound like myself and my voice comes in harsh and kind of loud causing some fatigue. Maybe I can tweak it with the software if I could use it on the PC involved but I can't and I kind of doubt it would fully resolve this issue.<br/><br/>The default ear cushions are terrible. I had to replace them with 3rd party (Wicked Cushions in this case) because they hurt too much and were extremely uncomfortably hot after even just 20 minutes. Now I can wear them for several hours straight.<br/><br/>Mic mote button and power button could be better positioned.<br/><br/>Wireless range seems decent and reliable.<br/><br/>The circular connecting joins to the red part and earcups seem likely to break at some point and are a questionable design choice. Plus, they're not very aesthetic.<br/><br/>Mic is fairly flexible and good distance from mouth while being sensitive enough to use further from mouth without issue.<br/><br/>Overall, good headset but has plenty of room for improvement.</span>

<span>I have been using this headset for a few months now and have really liked it. Have had no issues with it. Sound quality I think is decent for the price (not amazing, but pretty good). Very comfortable, my head does not hurt at all after wearing them for hours (with glasses). My only complaint is that it seems like when I use these with my laptop, the headphone jack slips out pretty easily, but I think that could just be my laptop.</span>

<span>I'll start off by saying that I absolutely love these headphones. They're bigger, and I have a big head, so if they're a bit loose on me, wellllll maybe not the purchase for you if you have a small head. They're a bit heavy but I don't mind that. My previous headsets have given me headaches from being too tight, and these headphones don't do that.<br/>I have a standalone mic, and my friends have told me that the mic quality on this headset sounds better than the microphone, so that's something.<br/>The RGB options on the kitty ears and the outside of the ear cups were the main reason I got them, let's all be honest, and I love them. They sync perfectly with my other devices, including ones that are not razer brand. I have received many compliments on zoom calls over them.<br/>Noise cancellation is better than most headsets I've used claiming to be noise canceling. If I don't have anything playing sound but I'm wearing them, sounds are only slightly muffled, but if you have anything playing sound, you're not going to hear most things. Sometimes I don't even notice it's storming until a really loud crack of thunder goes off nearby.<br/>Honestly, worth it. I only have regrets because I got a kitten and he is on a mission to destroy the cord.<br/>10/10 gaming headset.</span>

<span>Upon initial testing, I was struck by how much muddier these headphones sounded compared to the set of corsairs they replaced. Music seemed to be too bass-boosted to the point where the high end was getting drowned out by the low frequencies.<br/><br/>However, after fiddling with my audio drivers, I ended up custom EQ-ing the sound to my liking - namely boosting the highs and upper mids, as well as the lower lows.<br/><br/>If you care about how music sounds through these headphones, don't despair. Fiddle with your audio settings to tune the sound to your liking.</span>

<span>=== Update January 23, 2021 ===<br/><br/>After months of struggling with Razer's unacceptably bad customer support, I finally got a replacement for my headset. Everything I love about these headphones still stands (comfortable, padded metal headband, good sound), and now, with the replacement, the mute button doesn't generate a loud staticky noise for people on the other end. I feel confident that I can use my headphones for work.<br/><br/>Good customer support is key to repeat customers and word of mouth. I normally have excellent experiences with customer support because I'm polite and treat the support people like the human beings they are. I can't explain why Razer's support is so terrible. I find myself wondering if it's designed to make people give up on getting service.<br/><br/>Bottom line: read the reviews. Find a company with better customer support.<br/><br/>=== Update January 12, 2021  ===<br/><br/>TL;DR The headset's mute button has a known flaw that sends a staticky noise to anyone on the other end. Getting my headset replaced by Razer under warranty has been an ongoing saga. I recommend any other headset than this one. You might be lucky and get a great headset without the mute button flaw. But if you aren't lucky, you'll need the patience of Job to deal with Razer customer support.<br/><br/>Here's what's been happening: Razer has opened three warranty support cases, telling me I have 30 days to return my headset. In the first two cases, after many emails from me to them about problems with FedEx rejecting the tracking labels, they closed the cases before the 30-day time period had expired. In the most recent case, they closed it after only 11 days.<br/><br/>Each time they closed my case, I called Razer again. The tech support persons acknowledged that the cases had been closed too soon, but said there was nothing to do but open a new case, with all the time-consuming emails and proofs of purchase that a new case entails.<br/><br/>Latest incident/case: On January 1, 2021, Razer opened a third warranty support case, and then closed it on January 12. In this case, they claimed they emailed me another return label, but that I hadn't used it within the 14 days allotted for the label, so they were closing the case. (Math doesn't seem to be their strong suit.) But although I checked all possible email accounts and folders, including the spam folders, I didn't see the label. I emailed Razer three times asking for them to re-send the label, and they didn't.<br/><br/>I'm mind-boggled. I normally have excellent experiences with tech support and customer support, even with companies that are notorious for bad tech/customer support.<br/><br/>I called Razer again today to see if I can get this straightened out. At least this time they aren't opening a new case, and they sent me a label, so there's that. Here's hoping I get a replacement without the mute button flaw. If I do, I'll give the headset more stars, but I can't in all good conscience give their customer support anything but zero stars.<br/><br/>=== 12/31/2020 update ===<br/><br/>So the replacement process for the second case proceeded exactly as the first one did. Many emails back and forth with Razer, me asking for help with my FedEx tracking label, the responses ignoring my requests. (The FedEx website kept telling me the tracking number was invalid. I didn't want to take the package to a drop-off box if the tracking number was invalid.)<br/><br/>Once again, the tech support person handling my case closed the case early, claiming it was because 14 days had passed on the RMA. It's true that more than 14 days had passed, but as before, in multiple emails, they said I had 30 days.<br/><br/>I called Razer today and spoke with a support person. He said my case should not have been closed (because, obvs, it's not January 3 yet). He cheerfully opened yet another case for me. We'll see how well this goes.<br/><br/>By the way, if you're having the same trouble, I finally figured out the FedEx problem--you have to call FedEx and speak with a person. You can't use their automated phone scheduling and you can't use their website. I don't know why Razer didn't tell me this the many times I asked them about it.<br/><br/>Although the headset is good quality overall, the mute button problem makes it unacceptable for professional work. The headset has been sitting in a box to be returned to Razer since October, and meanwhile I've been making do with my decrepit backup headset.<br/><br/>=== Original review November 2020===<br/>I use my headset every day for work, and I've been buying inexpensive Logitechs, which are good but wear out in a year. So this year I treated myself to a more expensive headset.<br/><br/>I love the look of this headset, and I love how comfortable the earpieces are. The sound is good and the noise-cancelling is excellent.<br/><br/>However, from the very outset, people on the other end of a call complained of an irritating staticky noise every time I used the mute button. I looked it up and found many reviews in which this same problem was mentioned. Of course, this is unacceptable in a professional environment. The last thing you want to do is to generate an irritating noise while discussing important, tricky issues with your boss or co-workers.<br/><br/>Bottom line: getting the headset replaced by Razer under warranty has been an ongoing saga. I recommend any other headset than this one. You might be lucky and get a great headset without the mute button flaw. But if you aren't lucky, you'll need the patience of Job to deal with Razer customer support.<br/><br/>Here are the details of my interactions with Razer.<br/><br/>On October 7, 2020, I started the RMA process with Razer. After almost a month of emails back and forth in which they asked for a lot of testing on my end, they agreed to replace the headset. They issued an RMA and a FedEx shipping label on November 9. They told me the RMA would stay open for 30 days from the day it was opened. Take note of that; it's important.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, the email with the label went into my spam folder. Since I was receiving all their other emails, I had no reason to expect it to go to spam. I emailed Razer asking the status and they weren't helpful. It took me over a week to find the label email. I emailed them again saying I'd finally found it, and asking for help on the return, since they included only the instruction that I must return everything that had come in the box.<br/><br/>After many email exchanges with no adequate answers from Razer, I contacted FedEx to arrange a pickup. FedEx said the tracking number was invalid. I emailed Razer several times telling them that. Razor kept responding by saying it was either my error or a problem with FedEx. They advised me to contact FedEx for help. I finally emailed them on November 24 asking them point-blank if the tracking number had expired, and if so, could they send a new one. I got this response on November 28.<br/><br/>"Upon further checking your case, your prepaid shipping label with the tracking number, XXXX was created last 11/09/2020 and is still not used until now. However, please be advised that both your RMA XXXX and shipping label are already expired since it's already beyond 14 days from the date it was created. Our RMA is only valid for 14 days from the date it was provided. Please be informed that I will now close the case and RMA. This case is now considered closed. Since the RMA and shipping label are already expired, please contact our Technical Support team for a new case, new RMA and new shipping label to be provided to you. Don't worry, they will be able to assist you to schedule a pickup using a new shipping label."<br/><br/>At this point I feel like I was getting the run around and experiencing delaying tactics, especially the support person said my RMA had expired, but they had earlier said my RMA would be open for 30 days, and that it was the _label_ that would expire in 14 days. November 28 is NOT 30 days from November 9.<br/><br/>I was tempted to give up, and it feels like that's exactly what they want me to do, but instead I persevered and contacted Razer on 12/3 to restart the RMA process.<br/><br/>I hope I will get a replacement product that doesn't have the staticky sound when using the mute button. I'll keep you posted.</span>

Like anything else the cable does eventually good bad at the plug end however every set has lasted me over a year. I think the shortest time frame was about a year and a half and that is using them basically every day for hours on end. Sound is not broadcast quality by any means but it's not terrible either.

<span>First off, for a cheap headset, you get what you pay for. The build quality is rough but it works. Sound quality is decent, typical Razer bass heavy EQ out of the box, mic is good for a wireless headset.<br/><br/>My only issue is that I look like an air traffic controller with these on, they’re huge. The earcups combined are almost as big as my entire head. For me, it makes no difference since I don’t stream, but if I saw someone wearing these on twitch, I’d roast em for strapping two car speakers to their head</span>

<span>Great set of headphones, there’s not much else to say. I really enjoy the mic design, it’s not too small or too long. Sound quality is amazing, and the noise canceling is top.<br/><br/>The only thing I really recommend to those who do not use headphones for long periods of time is- if you’re looking for a lightweight headset.. this is definitely not the one for you. Overtime, the these headphones start to make my ears feel sore. Im not sure if it’s only me, but that’s my experience.</span>

<span>This wireless headset is nice.  It fits snugly and wraps around your ears.  After a full day of wearing it, your head might be feeling its snugness, but perhaps that's because it's new.  Not painful, but you'll know you've been wearing it.<br/><br/>This means they also reduce external sound.  When the wife asks me a question from across the room, I have to flip one ear off to hear her, or she has to raise her voice.  Don't get me wrong... you can't use these for construction noise cancelling or anything, but they will cut out your computer fan noise or other din sounds.<br/><br/>The audio is great. Good treble, good bass.  I'm not really an audiophile, so not sure what else to say about it.  For gaming, it's wonderful.  For watching videos, it's wonderful.<br/><br/>A charge lasts for 4-5 days, and that's of several hours per day of use.  I don't turn my sound up super loud, so if you do, I assume you'd get a little less time per charge.  I just plug my headset in at night once or twice per week into the micro-USB cable (not USB-C).  You CAN use the headset while the cord is plugged in, so no worries if you get the battery low warning during a game, just find a moment where you can reach down and plug in and continue your game.<br/><br/>The range is excellent.  I can take a bio break and keep listening/talking even while in the restroom or getting a beverage.  When I take the dog outside, I start to lose about 50% of the connection, but hey, that's pretty darn good!<br/><br/>Been using it for about 2 weeks.  Loving it!</span>

<span>I like these and use them constantly... on and off for over 12 hours a day.  For normal use (telecom) they are great.  But for music or loud gaming I find the distortion distracting and I simply can't use them to play.<br/><br/>If you don't need it loud, they are great.  Comfortable, weight is reasonable, noise canceling is as good passive cancelation as I have personally used, though my experience is not broad (maybe 4 headsets that were noise-cancelers).  For my main use, voice coms, they are excellent.  But I took away a star for lack of versatility overall, and 2 stars for lack of high-volume support.</span>

<span>Must download Steel Series GG software and go to Sonar to configure the EQ profile to get the MOST out of these headphones. THere you can adjust spatial and surround along with many more preconfigures but adjustable EQ presets. Alternately there is EQ adjustment on the display unit.<br/><br/>The noise canceling is only noticable when sound is actively flowing through the headset. If you plan to sit in silence with NC and expect silence, you will be dissapointed. During gameplay it is sufficent but AlienWare and even logitech I believe has them beat. The Transparent mode is awesome if like me you have people chiming in now and then or if you need awareness for whats happening in the real world while you game (kids).<br/><br/>As far as overall experience I love them but they arent the BEST sound or NC ive tried. The battery is good and it comes with a spare thats charges in display unit for quick swaps while playing. I would recomment these because they are a total package if more a jack of all trades master of none. The wireless range is EXCELLENT as well</span>

<span>I don’t have a small head but these feel loose like they’re gonna fall of my head if I lean forward or backward. They’re very comfortable if you’re sitting upright though. Sounds quality is pretty basic in my opinion. No bass. Not very loud. The microphone is the main reason I got these and that’s what’s keeping them at four stars. The mic is very good. I like how the tip glows red when you mute it. The chat mix in discord doesn’t work very well or at least it isn’t intuitive to set up. The lag to the wireless receiver is amazingly negligible. Pairing and swapping devices is very quick and simple once you get the hang of it. Not impressed with the feedback sounds for on/off/paired/muted, they seem very cheap and harsh for how well-designed they’re supposed to be. I wish these had Bluetooth.</span>

<span>I game A LOT and been through several headsets over the years. I picked this up because my Arctis 1 started having mic issues along with audio issues. Imo this is the best headset you can get without being tethered to a gaming dac which is something I'd like to get some day but more wires is not desirable for me rn.<br/><br/>I play a lot of Apex and this picks up footsteps a lot clearer and more accurately.<br/><br/>The sonar software on PC is awesome but takes time to setup and get to your liking.<br/><br/>Plug and play with PS4/PS5/PC (if you don't like to fiddle with settings that is)/Switch is a huge bonus.<br/><br/>I've never had a headset that had a fabric band for support and my god have I been missing out, this thing is comfortable as hell. As for the ear cups they're comfortable for me however I have read several reviews across all Steel Series headsets and everyone complains about them being uncomfortable. I guess if you have ears that stick out more these would not be ideal and you may want to switch them out with aftermarket ones.<br/><br/>As for music, these are good but I still find myself wanting more even after spending 2 hrs tweaking frequencies. Don't get me wrong they're loud as hell but if you're a true audiophile you'll know what I'm talking about.<br/><br/>The mic is extremely sensitive and I may add a piece of foam over mine. The headset provides feedback so you can know it's working and I never realized how much shit could be picked up until now. I'm definitely adjusting my settings more so people don't get annoyed with me (I have asthma so I breathe heavier than normal and I didn't really realize it until I got this headset lol) but the clarity my friends hear is crystal on their side. I also really like the light on the mic, if it's muted it's red and I can see it out of my peripheral vision. I spent so much time checking to see if I was muted or not with my Arctis 1 that this minor detail brings a quality of life improvement I didn't know I wanted.<br/><br/>The power button on this is also very responsive. Anyone that's used the Arctis 1 will know it takes an eternity for it to turn off. This headset, is less than a second and it beeps and turns off.<br/><br/>This came with several cords as well for different connections which I applaud. USB C is amazing, 3.5mm Jack, and then another one I'm really not sure what its called but it also acts as a 3.5mm.<br/><br/>Overall this is a 4.8/5 stars for me. Would definitely recommend anyone to pick this up.</span>

<span>I had been looking for a wireless headset and hadn't had much luck elsewhere. Because of my previous bad experiences, I was wary of this headset. I'm glad I went ahead and purchased them anyways. They're wonderful.<br/><br/>Pros:<br/>-Super Easy plug in and use<br/>-Very customizable sound and mic quality through G-Hub App (15 minutes tinkering to your liking and you're good forever)<br/>-Solid construction and still comfy to wear<br/>-AMAZING Range (Literally I can walk away from my computer throughout my condo - to the kitchen, bedroom etc. and still hear at the same quality as well as chat with friends through vc)<br/>-Easy Mute Button on back of headset so you can mute if you forgot to when you were at your computer<br/>-Customizable lights at front (You can't see them while wearing, but it's a cute little extra detail)<br/>-Easy to charge USB-C cable<br/>-Great Battery Life (I charge every night to be safe, but I'll wear these all day with no signs of drop in quality)<br/>Cons:<br/>-They take up a USB slot on your computer<br/>-You need to have G-Hub running in the background of your computer for full effect (doesn't take much cpu from what I've seen and you can set to auto start in the background with your presets)<br/><br/>Seriously, I was looking to get a wireless headset because I was sick and tired of wired headsets having their wires bend the wrong way and lose sound quality or have random other mic quality issues. I'm so impressed by the combination of hardware and software here. Every time I'm chatting with friends over discord and I walk to my kitchen to grab some water or a snack, I'm so happy I can stay in the conversation.<br/><br/>tl;dr A solid wireless gaming headset with great range and lovely sound/mic quality (especially if you take the few minutes to download G-Hub and tweak things to your liking).<br/><br/>UPDATE: 10/26/2020 - I've used these for a couple weeks now and wanted to update after reading some complaints from other reviewers.<br/>-I'm not anywhere near an audiophile, but I've been plenty happy with the sound coming through this headset. I played around a little bit in the software to get a preset sound I liked, and just stuck with that. It seems severe audiophiles are having issues with minor tweaks, so if you need a really specific sound these probably aren't for you.<br/>-I stream on twitch and my community commented my mic sounded a tad worse than my old wired headset. This made sense given it's not a wired connection, but I also went in to the Blue voice settings in the GHub software and asked a friend who is studying to be an audio engineer their opinion. They happily told me that a lot of the settings on their presets were excessive or just wrong and removing/adjusting those more severely created a much more solid sound overall (things like turning off the de-esser and removing the sound gate or compressor since they essentially did the same thing). That made the mic much better, but I still use my old wired one when streaming to be safe since I don't need the convenience of the wireless for that. I use these for everything other than streaming and the mic is still plenty great for chatting with friends over discord etc. Plus if I was concerned about having an amazing mic for streaming I would invest in an actual full desk microphone rather than just using my headset.<br/>-I want to re-iterate I have had absolutely no issues with the range. I live in a 900 sqft condo and literally will wear this everywhere while chatting with friends and have had no quality drop or anything. Any reviews that say they can't go to the other side of the room likely received a defective model and should request a refund.<br/><br/>Knocking off a star for the amount of tweaking you need to do to really make the mic less bad (that's what the presets should have done, but my audio engineer friend is outraged at some of the choices made on that software  and how much the average viewer would need to tweak it). Overall, still happy with the headset. With how much stress trying to find a wireless headset that works well enough for me as an average gamer/streamer etc. has been, I'm happy this is a solution that does work.</span>

<span>UPDATE 5/20/22: I still love this headset and the software updates that have been added since I got it. The newest features block out chewing noises, something I never knew could be so useful. I actually haven't noticed the volume wheel giving me any issues lately, which is nice, but I still haven't bothered with the rgb custom settings.<br/><br/>I have found that sometimes the ear pads will move lower than my ears and sit really close to my cervical lymph nodes, which I'm only aware of because I got an infection and swelling in my throat on one side that nearly closed my airway before I was able to see a doctor and get it treated. Now I keep the sizing on a smaller setting so it won't sit low enough to put pressure on that area. I don't know for sure that's what caused the problem, but I'd rather not go through that again to find out.<br/><br/>ORIGINAL REVIEW:<br/>There are so many big, bulky, black and red/gray/blue headsets out there, but not a lot that are feminine unless you want PINK. Which I don't. I was very excited to find this in white with a swappable fabric strap, though the purples and blues in the strap are pretty much exactly what I was looking for.<br/><br/>First off, I have a very soft voice. Cheap headsets do a poor job of picking my voice out of background noise, and I end up being suppressed more than anything else. While gaming with friends, they have expressed concerns that I am being smothered with a pillow, have fallen out of my chair and my headset slid across the room, or that I am sleep-gaming. Right out of the box, this headset has put all their worries to rest. It transmits my voice at a volume that no longer requires them to turn their game volume nearly all the way down just to hear me. I installed the G Hub application, enabled the Blue VO!CE feature, and selected the "High Voice - Soft" profile after testing out a few others. Suddenly I could be heard as well as any one else in the chat, and I had to remember to keep my under-breath commentary to internal only.<br/><br/>Those friends say the noise suppression is great on this headset too. I have a loud brother who, on a regular basis, walks around the house with his headset on, wailing his superiority for all the neighborhood to hear. With my previous headset, I could see my name light up in discord when he was talking in the next room over MORE than when I was talking (a testament to how quiet my voice is). With the G733, he can be screeching like a YouTube gamer right outside my room, and the noise suppression blocks him out. The thick cushion earpads do a pretty hefty job of blocking him out of my own cranial receptors, so we no longer have to pretend he is in the voice channel with us.<br/><br/>The only down side I have found so far has to do with the volume control. Sometimes, the display pops up showing an incorrect 100% volume level, and turning the wheel seems to have no effect on the volume whatsoever. Other times it just decides to work. My 10 minutes of internet research found that this is a problem with most Logitech devices, so I'm not going to be mad about it.<br/><br/>The LightSync feature allows you to change the colors that show on the LED strips, as well as the way they glow. It rarely seems to work when I try to pick just a couple of colors, and once I unplug the receiver and plug it back in, that setting is dumped, and the default rainbow rotation begins again. I have given up trying to personalize it. I don't have the patience to repeat myself over and over.<br/><br/>All in all I am extremely happy with the abilities of this headset for the price I paid. It is super cute, makes my voice audible, blocks out my brother's raid commentary, and is actually surprisingly comfortable.</span>

<span>IM SO MAD. I'VE WASTED SO MUCH MONEY . So I've had these headsets for about 1 month and I'm SO UPSET IT TOOK ME SO LONG TO FIND THESE.<br/>  I wish I bought them sooner. I would of saved money because I wouldn't of bought all the other headphones in search for that perfect audio quality.<br/><br/>I'm a HUGE fan of PS5 and I've been having a hard time finding a decent pair of headphones that would give me that good directional sound effect that ive been seqrching so long for.  I mostly play Dayz, but I also play Fortnite, Call of duty, Rocket League, and other fps games.<br/><br/> Some brands claim that they are "3D", "7k","hi-def", or even "Hi-Fi", but NONE of those headphones can even come close to comparing to the amazing sound these headphones have when using them on PS5. The noise canceling and other features are AMAZING.<br/><br/> Sonys Pulse 3D headphones are JUNK, even after adjusting the settings within the PS5 audio software. I've also tried many different brands such as Astro's, Turtle beech, xcloud, and Razer. Trust me when I say NONE of those are better than these SteelSeries 7P+. They might be cheaper, but if your looking for quality over price, these are the right choice. Plus, When I decide to make the switch to PC gaming, I'll still be able to use these headphones.<br/><br/>I also purchased the warranty protection plan, because when (or if) these decide to fail, I WILL be getting another pair. I'll be sticking with these headphones throughout the rest of my gaming days unless they decide to sell a better pair within the same price point.<br/><br/>Thank you so much SteelSeries for building such a quality set of Headphones. Your a God</span>

<span>I purchased this headset for work in an office where I did not want complete noise cancellation but was instead looking for an over-the-ear option that helped muffle office noise but where I could still hear someone speak if they were next to me. With this headset, the volume of ambient noise is reduced enough to lessen distractions while still letting me hear what I need to.<br/><br/>I am one of those people who is rarely able to use standard plastic-adjuster baseball caps, because even the largest setting is too small, and I particularly wanted to share that these headphones are extremely comfortable. Without being able to actually tell how easily the headband bends or how stiff the ear pads are, I am always nervous to purchase online. The plastic in the headband gives easily and isn't noticeable on top of my head even after wearing the headphones for a while, and most importantly, I don't have the ear pain nor pain around my ears from it being too tight, even when I am wearing glasses. The earpads cover my ears nicely and are soft enough to not put any extra pressure beyond what is needed to keep them on my head. The fact they are so lightweight probably helps this as well, as it doesn't have to squeeze inward as hard to keep a heavy headset from sliding off.<br/><br/>The earpads are covered in cloth instead of vinyl, which also reduces the amount squeak or noise that is created by me moving my head or speaking. Any contact with the headband that happens isn't loudly conducted through the headphones either, which is an issue I've had with some that are very tight-fitting and have vinyl pad covers and a metal frame. The sound quality is good, though my primary use is quiet music listening and conference calls, so I can't speak to gaming or movie watching.</span>

<span>Updated Review (05/23/22):<br/><br/>Logitech reached out to me and sent me a new pair of headphones with a firmware update that can be installed online. They truly went above and beyond, and I have yet to experience any issues with this new pair. They've now outlasted my old pair by a sizeable margin, and my faith in this product has been restored. I would highly recommend these headphones as long as you are willing to look online on a computer to install the firmware before use with other products or your PC. They sound great, they're comfortable, and they have a great battery life. Thanks to Ambrose Lee of Logitech for showing me such kindness and for giving me absolutely above and beyond levels of customer service.<br/><br/>Updated Review (10/20/21):<br/><br/>These headphones are now having loads of connection and sound issues after just about a month of use. I've used them with multiple devices using the USB port and they have constantly had problems with random disconnection and failure to reconnect. I have done my diligence in attempting a lot of troubleshooting methods. There is no excuse for releasing a product that has this little testing, or advertising a wireless headphone like this with no option for connecting it with a 3.5mm audio jack when the wireless technology is this pathetic, shoddy, and unreliable. I would recommend avoiding these headphones at all costs.<br/><br/>Initial Review:<br/><br/>For about 3 and a half years, I've used Sennheiser HD 559 headphones for gaming at my PC every day. They sounded incredible and got heavy use. However, recently, they had come into having some issues, so I went on Amazon to check out their headset options.<br/><br/>At first, I was going to purchase another hi-fi open-back headphone, but Amazon recommended me these Logitech G435 headphones, which featured wireless USB connectivity.<br/><br/>I was intrigued about what kind of quality I could get for just $80 in a wireless over-ear gaming headset, so I decided to purchase them. I had used Logitech G433 headphones in the past and was very fond of them, and I have trusted Logitech for a long time, as they have always made solid products.<br/><br/>This headset is no exception to that quality statement.<br/><br/>Fit:<br/><br/>I first want to talk about the fit. These headphones are not very big. However, they are just the right size for people who have smaller to normal size heads. I, though, have a decently large head. These headphones fit very well on me, but I had to adjust them nearly all the way to their max extension. Despite this, they rest very comfortably, give my ears plenty of room inside the earcup, and are pretty much exempt from producing any fatigue due to their astonishingly light weight of just 164 grams. The only complaint I have is due to the headband, which could have used far more padding, but it suffices as it is and doesn't cause too much discomfort.<br/><br/>Sound:<br/><br/>As for sound, they definitely don't match my previous headphones, the Sennheiser HD 559. But that's okay, because I didn't expect them to. These headphones pack in a decent quality microphone, wireless connectivity, high quality build materials, and above-average comfort for $20 less than the aforementioned Sennheisers at MSRP.<br/><br/>In lieu of that, these headphones sound very good for their price. They sound almost identical to the Logitech G433 headphones, with even a little bit more clarity on the low end.<br/><br/>It is worth noting though that these headphones will not do well at cancelling out any background noise, so if that is something that is important to you, I advise you to look elsewhere.<br/><br/>Battery &amp; Connectivity:<br/><br/>The listed battery life of 18 hrs is pretty accurate from my experience, which is plenty of juice for multiple days of average gaming spans. As long as you plug the headphones in to charge every few days, they should never run out of battery on you.<br/><br/>The connectivity blew me away. There is absolutely no noticeable latency, which is already an improvement over countless other wireless gaming headsets I've tried featuring USB wireless connectivity, with some being almost double the price of these G435s. I will disclaim, however, that I have NOT tried these with their Bluetooth mode, nor have I tried them on any consoles that support these headphones, only my PC.<br/><br/>Overall Verdict:<br/><br/>I have very positive opinions about these headphones. While they are definitely not perfect, they are a very good choice for the price of $80 in my opinion, and I plan to use these headphones as my daily gaming headset until it's time for me to move on again due to wear and tear. Good job, Logitech.</span>

<span>TL;DR : good headphones for the price definitely recommend! Wish they headband fit better when wearing anything else on head.<br/><br/>Honestly I’m a fan of these. They’re great for the price (especially when on sale)! Not only that they are light and fit almost perfectly, I can even fit my AirPods under comfortably. Great battery life and works well with my pc with the dongle and on my oculus with Bluetooth. Definitely good with Dolby atmos. Though I’m no audiophile, the only thing I really feel is left to desire is more headband room. They fit my head great on their own, but when I wear a hat or have my oculus on it can be a bit of a stretch and they sit at a weird angle. Otherwise I like them :)</span>

<span>I was searching for an over-ear headset with the USB to Gaming PC as well as Bluetooth for my Android...believe me when I say that there are not many options from well known PC companies until you hit the $200 mark or so.<br/><br/>I did some measurements (best i could) for anyone else concerned with the smaller size head factor, I'm 6 ft tall and skinny, so i expected it to be an issue.<br/><br/>I wear these while wearing my baseball cap and still have a bit of wiggle room so its not half as bad as they make it out to be, the one downside to being designed for kids is even the black pair has the yellow springs that make them look that way a bit.<br/><br/>I would say they strech downward between 7-8" from the top band to the very end of the ear.<br/>I measured from my baseball cap top button to past my ear and got about the same, for anyone wondering how to measure something so odd.<br/><br/>Measuring from ear to ear at that the 7" length (wearing them) I had a 7" width , which is perfectly comfortable on me. they can go wider but i can't speak on how tight they might get if they did.<br/><br/>The ear piece (including outer foam) is about 4", so if you measure from the top of your ear to the bottom and your around 3" (give or take a little) you should be good on that end.<br/><br/>As for quality:  They sound great on PC and my Android, I use an EQ on my PC for my speakers so its hard for me to tell if I'm getting the full surround or not since I'm used to it...but the options are definitely there and I don't feel like I'm missing sounds. At least not yet, they're fairly new to me.<br/>The Mic does not have the best noise cancellation considering its on ear, I can hear myself shuffle over my shoulder going to press the buttons and such if I'm recording...but its not overly bad either. I figure its no worse than using a Mic right in front of you or a webcam, except when your hitting the buttons (since they are right there)<br/><br/>Switching modes can be a hassle if your wearing them, but if you do it while you holding them you can clearly see a color difference telling you which mode your in at the moment...I had a small issue getting the Mic to work on Bluetooth but once I forgot the device and reconnected it was gone.<br/><br/>No issue on Windows 7 or 10, drivers installed automatically and everything worked as long as I wasn't in the wrong mode.<br/><br/>I haven't had them long enough to comment on battery life but they did charge fast enough.<br/><br/>All in all, if you can overlook the yellow springs, and they fit you comfortably...it the cheapest total package you'll find from most companies. If they added a detachable noise cancelling mic and lost the springs in exchange for a bigger sized fit, these would be top tier.<br/><br/>For what they cost and what you get, definitely worth it. If they don't fit, you can always return them.</span>

<blockquote><em><div class="a-row a-spacing-small review-data"><span class="a-size-base review-text review-text-content" data-hook="review-body">
<span>Let me preface by stating I am reviewing the Blackshark v2 pro. Sometimes amazon combines similar item reviews, this is important and that I have owned this for over a year with consistent usage, using it multiple days a week for 1-8 hours.<br/><br/>This thing has a lot going for it with very few downsides that in my opinion do not outweigh the pros and if you can get this for $150 or less it is 100% worth it.<br/><br/>Pros<br/><br/>- Noise cancellation is so strong, sometimes I don't hear my wife when she calls for me. She was the one who bought this for me lol<br/>- Sound quality through synapse can be adjusted to your liking, and I can't recommend it without it (kind of a con)<br/>- Incredibly comfortable even with glasses. There is a lot of good padding on the head and ears, prior headsets this was always an issue, recently before this I owned a corsair void elite and even that wasn't perfect, but it was close in this category.<br/>- Battery life is actually really strong, just be sure to charge it after each usage. I've only ever gotten this to low battery where it beeps at me if I use it for 10-12 hours without charging it. Sometimes thats a long gaming day sometimes thats multiple days. I'm pretty good about keeping things charged, so this isn't a pain point for me, but may be for you. That said you can charge while using it.<br/>- Removable microphone, probably not a huge deal for most, but I use these as headphones not a headset. I use an external USB mic for better quality (I'll get into that later).<br/>- Ability to use this with 3.5mm port. I wouldn't recommend this without the USB function, as the USB DAC it comes with is decent enough and having used it without it, this is where it fails, but I'm labeling the 3.5mm port as a pro in case you have a multipurpose headset in mind<br/>- THX 7.1, now this is just virtual surround sound but in the couple games I have tried, notably monster hunter world, it performs really well, its weird to get used to but its done well enough. Not a huge selling point, you can get this elsewhere, but noted.<br/><br/>Cons<br/><br/>- Without the USB DAC and synapse you are losing a lot of potential. This thing is really good for sound quality once you configure it, but on it's own it's horrible, this is why I did not get the wired version of the blackshark v2 with just 3.5mm.<br/>- Microphone quality isn't great, its honestly worse than most and for $180 it should be a lot better, this is why I use an external mic. Unless you're yelling, your friends will probably say you're quiet.<br/>- Intermittent disconnects, unsure if this is a hardware, connection or synapse issue but it happens infrequently it doesn't bother me, but should be noted.<br/>- Synapse, I swear I've had issues with every gaming software (ghub, icue, synapse) but recently synapse has been a pain. I love iCUE (or did) but hate corsair software, but if synapse continues to get worse I will look elsewhere for another headset.<br/><br/>Overall, if I had to buy this thing again I'd do it for $130 or so. I wouldn't spend $180, I'd just get professional wired headphones, but this thing has a lot going on that it made it worth it to me. I recommend these headphones to anyone who is in the market for a wireless headset in this budget range who doesn't hold grudges against razer. In that niche, I think its perfect.</span>

<span>9/10<br/>Overall, I LOVE the product. I am usually a stickler for a Hard Wired connection to reduce latency as I am a gamer but, this did not let me down in the slightest. My biggest letdown was the earcups, specifically their noise cancellation ability. I came from leatherette earcups with a solid back for ridiculously noise cancelling and great audio quality (Astro A40's) and I know these are different and I do love them but, I miss that closed-back, REALLY noise cancelling. If you're wanting a wireless product that's affordable and has a removable microphone. HIGHLY HIGHLY recommend! I had been looking for headsets for years with a removable mic, why I originally went with Astro and just recently they seem to be getting that most gamers go with an external microphone and are allowing the flexibility with a removable one!</span>

<span>I use headsets mostly for discord, playing survival games, and listening to music—and although I would not classify myself as an audiophile, I can appreciate some degree of layering, and I certainly enjoy my bass.  What I want in a wireless headset is comfort, lasting build quality, clear mic, good sound, and good range (tall order, I know, but I can dream).  I am aware that wireless headsets are mostly not yet comparable in quality to wired headsets, I don't think technology is far off and I like being able to stay in conversation or listening to music while making food in the kitchen. In the end, I returned this headset after one month's use as the mic suddenly stopped working one morning when it was working perfectly the previous night.  I tried to have the issue resolved to no avail and gave up.  I simply did not want to push it when it failed me after one month with subpar range and sound quality.  Read on for my in-depth ratings on each feature this headset has to offer.<br/><br/>THE GOOD<br/>Comfort - 5 stars<br/>I liked the ear cuff size and material, the material is a breathable mesh which I have come to prefer after using this headset as it does not cause irritation around my ears like other leather-like materials tend to do.  The build is overall light but surprisingly sturdy.  I feel that these qualities allowed me to use them for long periods of time comfortably, which can go on for even 12+ hours sometimes (I am an artist so sometimes I get in the zone especially while listening to music).<br/><br/>Volume Knob - 5 stars<br/>I also liked the volume knob, it has a middle divet so you always know where 50% is.  It has just the right amount of resistance to not get accidentally bumped but still turn the dial effortlessly.  I like the placement, easy to reach, but not in the way.<br/><br/>Battery Life - 4.5 stars<br/>Battery life was great, I had only a couple times where battery was low during gaming sessions, in which case I was able to simply plug it in for charging and still use it at the same time.<br/><br/>Mobile Wire - 5 stars<br/>I also like the feature of the included 3.5mm jack so I could use my headset with my phone, which came in handy if I wanted to be in discord while making food in the kitchen as the range does not reach too well.<br/><br/>THE MEH<br/>Mic Quality - 2 stars<br/>My friends did not note anything spectacular about my mic sound quality, but it got the job done and they could hear me just fine.  I was previously using a Razer Nari Essential prior, so maybe there were no significant changes to their mic technology.  However, the mic mysteriously stopped working altogether for me after a month.  I did everything I could to try to resolve it, but to no avail.  I didn't want to keep a pair of $170 headphones so I have since returned them.<br/><br/>Sound Quality - 2.5 stars<br/>The sound quality of the headphones are definitely subpar out of the box so you will want to download the program (I am personally unaware if other programs will work just as well).  The preset options weren't amazing so it took some messing around to get it to something decent, but I imagine that audiophiles would rate the overall sound quality below average.  The bass wasn't perfect but it did the job for me, I didn't sense a whole lot of layering in music unless I really strained myself to listen for them.  I am not good at anything music-related but to me it seemed like there were blurry lines defining the sounds.  Perhaps for that reason I did not experience immersion in my games anymore than the nari essential did.<br/><br/>THE BAD<br/>Wireless Range - 2 stars<br/>Finally, my qualms with this headset... the range of this wireless headset was not amazing.  My kitchen is maybe 15 feet from my room and the connection starts getting spotty once I enter the kitchen, and drops completely after two more feet.  I was only able to get the extra two feet before dropping after moving the dongle from the back of my computer to the front.<br/><br/>Mute Button - 2 stars<br/>While I like the way the mute button pops in when muted and is popped out unmuted, the mute button is, in my opinion, poorly located.  Even after a month I still had struggles reaching for the mute button sometimes despite being raised.  It is just an awkward placement.  There is no other indicator that you are muted unless you can feel whether the mute button is raised or pushed in.<br/><br/>THX Spatial - 1 star<br/>I did not care for this feature at all.  I tried it with discord, music, and games, but all it did for me was muddy up sounds and make voices have a weird echo.</span>

<span>I had been using the Corsair Void Pro for a long time, and decided it was time for an upgrade.  I tried many different headsets from many different companies, and they were either uncomfortable or had terrible sound.  Then I found the Razer BlackShark V2.  Although a simplistic design, the headset is extremely comfortable and has great sound.  I tried the THX Spatial sound app from Razer and it really didn't seem that great to me.  Instead, I got a DTS license and turned on DTS Headphone X spatial sound through windows and it sounds awesome!  The only negative about this headset is that it doesn't control the system sound like most headsets.  The volume dial turns the headset up and down separately from the system sound.  Not a huge deal, because once you figure out how to set the system volume, you can get the sound at the perfect level.  I'm very happy with this purchase and highly recommend this headset.</span>

<span>After about a month of use the mic started to randomly stop working. Really frustrating when I’m in a call and one second the mic is working and the next it is not.</span>

<span>I purchased this headset so that I could use it during meetings for work. This headset is great at noise cancelling as well as allowing me the best audio quality. I use it when I game as well. Since the receiver uses USB C I can use it on my mac, my gaming computer as well as my phone. It works great for listening to music as well. Since I can remove the microphone, the headset acts like over the ear headphones. Which is just great.<br/><br/>My one complaint is that if I ever lose the receiver, I will have to buy a new pair. Other than that, they are phenomenal.</span>

<span>They are so comfy! And the sound is amazing. I like that you can remove the mic as well. I haven't had many issues with connecting to my laptop. I think the constant beeping when it's low in power can be annoying, but I stopped noticing it. The headphones are also very comfortable. They don't do the noise cancellation where it feels like your ears are being sucked in, so that's nice (that makes me nauseous).</span>

<span>These were the 3rd headset brand I tried. I returned the first two. I've not had any issues at all with the Razer Braccuda X's. Been using them for a few months. All the switches are in the right place and they feel super comfortable even with my big head.<br/><br/>One thing to note here is they are NOT BLUETOOTH enabled, you have to connect the supplied wireless dongle which is usb-c however they also provide a usb-a to usb-c conversion cable in the box that is actually nice and long which really helps in some situations. For real-time gaming bluetooth is far inferior anyway adding about 100ms latency between cable. dongle wireless latency is negligible so hearing that gunshot 100ms quicker can be the difference.<br/><br/>I've also found that some older electronics like my Sony TV give me a "not-compaitable" message.<br/><br/>There is a newer version of these available for $99 which is why these have been discounted and that version I believe does have bluetooth, I'm not sure if it also has the dongle capability.<br/><br/>One thing I do really really like about these is you can also connect them via a supplied audio cable and you can charge them while using them with the supplied USB-C cable in both wireless and wired mode and from what I've been able to test they charge faster than the batter is depleted so battery life is not really that big of a deal. It does however last at least 7-8 hours which is great. That one time though when I forgot to put them on charge and really needed to use them to play it was amazing that they charged up almost completely in two hours while playing and using them at the same time.</span>

<h2 style="text-align: center;">FAQS</h2>
<h3><h3>Can you use a gaming headset for streaming?</h3></h3>
    

It Depends on the headset. Many gaming headsets are not equipped with the necessary components to stream.
<h3><h3>What is the best gaming headset for sound quality?</h3></h3>
    

There is no one "best" gaming headset for sound quality, as different headsets offer different features and benefits. Some of the factors you may want to consider when choosing a gaming headset include the type of audio connector (3.5mm, USB, or optical), the type of audio codecs it supports, the noise cancellation capabilities, and the brand or model.
