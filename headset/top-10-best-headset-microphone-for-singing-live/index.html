<span>works for my friend's microphone system.Good buy. I was lookingfor an extra microphone headset that will work with my single wireless system and my friend's dual wireless microphone system. You need to know which one will work based on the indicator on the tip of the connector. The only problem is there is a hissing sound when you talk. Overall price it  ok.</span>

<span>I was looking for a cardioid microphone to use with my Rode Filmmaker for YouTube videos.  I want a cardioid microphone because it is directional I wanted it to preferably pick-up my voice over background sounds.  This mic is directional off the end.  Unfortunately the gooseneck it is on is too short to point the mic at you mouth.  The other issue is it will not stay up in place and droops down.  The mic works electrically with my Filmmaker and the capsule sounds fine when pointed at something you want to record.  If the gooseneck was longer, had more girth, and would stay up this would be a winner.  The too short and limp gooseneck makes microphone a looser.  It is too bad since it could have been a nice product, but It was useless.  I sent it back for a refund.</span>

<span>I bought this mic because I wanted to busk (street perform) using a small guitar amp which features a mic input.  I wanted a mic that would leave my hands free to play guitar, but failed to find a mic that would work because most of the ones I saw need phantom power.  My busking amp can't provide phantom power.  Finally I saw an affordable wireless lavalier mic outfit, and it worked, but the mic was too far from my face for singing.  This mic is the answer to that problem.  Can't say anything about the sound quality, but since the amp slings 5 watts, has a 6 inch speaker, and will have to amplify guitar, voice and backing tracks, I don't think that the MIC'S sound quality will be an issue.  Score!</span>

<span>The headset is overall good. It does the job but the quality is not there. Cheaply manufactured. It is a shame since I love Pyle products however over the last 5 years, this company has gone downhill with overall design and quality in their products.<br/><br/>Come on PYLE, Do a better job!</span>

<span>I bought this mic for my son who plays electric guitar, so he can hear his voice over the instrument amp when he's practicing. It's great in that he doesn't have to play around with a boom stand and having to angle the mic to get the pickup level he wants. He can practice in a lazy position on his bed or on the couch, without having to ditch the mic, and it sounds as good as your setup will let it sound. I run it straight to an acoustic amp with 6 band eq, and it sounds no better and no worse than my SM 58. The pickup is not as sensitive, though, so it needs a little more amplification to get the level you want, but I guess that's a good thing for this kind of mic. The only thing that I'm really concerned about is the durability of the cable. It is very thin, and feels a lot more fragile than say, a usb phone charger. The XLR connector is made out of really thin plastic, and could probably break if a heavy person sat on it, so I'm going to have to insist that my son restricts the use of this mic to those under a certain weight limit.:)That may become an issue as time goes by, but hopefully my son can avoid mistreating this thing, and we can have a few good years with this product.</span>

<span>I have this hard wired to my speech recognition system. I have used a number of microphones over the last 10 years.I have been using this one for over a year.<br/><br/>This device does not care if my refrigerator, air-conditioner, fan, or television is in the background, regardless of volume(within reason). I am using it now and listening to a rock station in the background on speakers about 18 inches from my heirs(first mistake it's made. I meant ears).<br/><br/>As long as I speak clearly, it types exactly what I say. It likes to have the microphone in the same position every time I use it, but this is not nearly as crucial as with others.<br/><br/>After fiddling with the set up for a while, it works seamlessly  with my  eyeglasses. Sometimes I leave it on for so long I forget it's there when I go to get up .I rigged the end of an extension cable so that, regardless of angle, when the cord is pulled it disconnects smoothly.<br/><br/>Back on subject. When compared to the last, $60.00 headset which I destroyed the plug on, the difference is truly amazing. All I did was change to this microphone.<br/>Team it with Nuances latest Dragon offering, and a dedicated Andrea USB soundcard with noise reduction software, and it does not matter if I'm on laptop, desktop , home, or train. All that changes is the speed.<br/><br/>there were three mistakes in this article. When played back, it is only me not enunciating clearly in each case.  I will have to work on that. I am the weak link in my system, now.<br/> It is worth every penny. Try it, you'll like it.<br/><br/>Update December 16, 2015. I have worn the foam off the ear pads, otherwise it is still doing fine.</span>

<span>I’m a small business owner who uses Zoom for client appointments.<br/><br/>I work in health + fitness coaching and need the ability to move around and demonstrate concepts fluidly.<br/><br/>Prior to this mic I had gone through a couple of the Kimafun wireless options but they started cutting out around 6 months of regular use and the sound quality wasn’t great.<br/><br/>Looking to step up a bit, I purchased this mic only to return it for a replacement and I’ll now be returning that as well before getting something a bit pricier.<br/><br/>Hermes’s my breakdown:<br/><br/>-Better audio quality than the cheapy wireless mics<br/><br/>-Pairing and setup were simple.<br/><br/>-Mic itself could be angled up toward you a little, which was nice if it’s sitting horizontally on a regular T shirt collar.<br/><br/>-Upped the gain all the way but even maxed out and at full volume I almost had to shout to be consistently heard and I’m a loud person. Every other mic I have access to is louder; MacBook built-in, iPhone headphones even.<br/><br/>-Batteries need to be changed weekly at the rate I use it.<br/><br/>-Battery drain is indicated by a gradual fading of an indicator light that you won’t see easily because it’s on your hip. You’re left guessing as to when you’re truly about to run out of juice.<br/>-Hip clip was very tight and needed to be manually loosened.<br/><br/>-The mic started cutting out within a week of use. Happened with both units I ordered.<br/><br/>-The USB body is so big that on my Anker dock attachment it blocks the other USB A port so I had to purchase a USB extender.<br/><br/>In the end the mic was an improvement in sound quality but a hassle on most other fronts.<br/><br/>It sounds like other folks have had a good experience but it looks like I’ll be moving up a price bracket.<br/><br/>Hope that helps you!</span>

<span>I bought these mics for wedding work. They kinda work but I've had times where the audio was unusable. They don't work very far. The reciever is the worst part because it has a very sensitive big on button that has multiple times turned on in my bag without me knowing and been dead when I need it. I like that they are rechargeable but I wish they had a battery option as well. When it works it's great, but it's died on me so many times when I needed it.</span>

<span>Finally getting around writing my own review after having these for almost 2 years. I've mostly use them with my Sony mirrorless camera and they've worked fine. Better than expected for the price. Nothing compared to some of the higher end and higher priced options available but again for the price you really can't beat these from what I've experienced. That said I finally got around to trying this with an iphone. I pulled out the cable that's supposed to be for an iPhone and plugged it in. Strangely enough I was still only able to get audio to come through the built-in mic of the phone. I played around with it for quite a while and I tried a few of my other similar mics and just couldn't get it to work and that's when I realized that they had actually included two cables for DSLR cameras and not one for cameras and one for phones. You can tell this by looking at the 3.5mm ends. In my case they're identical but if you look at the pictures here in the description I'm missing the four pole adapter. Not a huge deal. It did take me three tries to get the correct adapter from Amazon but now that I have it these actually work pretty well with the portable phone setup I put together. I'd still recommend the setup but I'm only giving it four stars because of the mix-up in regards to including two of the same adapter. By the way I double confirmed this by trying the supposed phone adapter with my mirrorless camera and it works fine. I knew it would but I had to try anyway. Just make sure you get all the right accessories and you should be good to go.</span>

<span>I'm sending it back right after just receiving it. It does everything it's intended to do, which is: to plug the receiver to a speaker in order to be heard. This is by no means meant for streaming or blogging. The quality is not good enough for clean audio recording by any means. The mics pic up only a few centimeters from the sound source, so the lapel mic is out of the question, the moment you turn up the volume you get a large amount of noise. So the only option is the headset, which again, if you're doing live stream you cannot have a headset like that on video. This is good for connecting to a speaker in front of a crowd, for the purpose of being heard, and that's it.</span>

<span>I got this dual UHF mic kit to use with a portable battery operated PA amp (Behringer MPA40BTPRO). So far, I’ve tried the mic kit out but have not yet used it in the field. I will be using it to give tours in a bus in a few weeks. It will also be used for dance teaching and to MC events with music playing simultaneously. The description is not clear on a few things. It’s actually better than I expected.<br/><br/>Receiver pairs instantly with the mics regardless of frequency change.<br/><br/>There is an extremely clever mounting shoe adapter to use the receiver with a camera or smartphone.<br/><br/>The mics are of average quality but great for PA use. I suspect a professional singer would want to use a higher quality mic.<br/><br/>The mic transmitter body packs have independent volume controls (this part was not clear from the description given). This allows two people to be mic’d at different levels.<br/><br/>In the event of feedback one just touches the volume up and down buttons together for instant suppression.<br/><br/>I tested it with the Behringer amp while simultaneously playing music from an iPhone via Bluetooth through a different input in the amp. You would not expect Bluetooth and UHF to interfere but I wanted to make sure. They passed the test with flying colors.<br/><br/>The construction quality of the parts of the kit is good. They thoughtfully include an adapter from 1/4 in female to 1/8 in male and 1/8 female to stereo mini male.<br/><br/>The various pieces come in a die cut foam block in their box. I would suggest keeping this for storage. I would have loved the option of a small handle bag to store the components. It will be easy to get the headsets, lav mics and wires tangled. I intend to find one but keep the foam block to use with it.<br/><br/>Overall this dual mic kit is well made, easy to use and works very well. I think it compares favorably to the Audio 2000 dual mic kit that costs 2.5 x as much. The Audio 2000 I’ve used had better mic quality but the receiver is much bigger and takes more setup. I’m not sure that quality difference would convince me to spend the extra money on it if my use was to be simple PA amp or PA amp with simultaneous music or video<br/><br/>Photos show back of portable PA am with the mic receiver plugged in--very compact and easy to use.<br/><br/>NB: I may obtain a discount by leaving this review but I believe my review not to have been influenced by this possibility.</span>

<span>I got this because it was cheap  and cool looking.  It is PLASTIC! The plus to that is if you have a shi&amp;*y ground you won't cook your lips.  The minus  if you drop it  say  goodbye .  I tested this with a sm58  same cord and pa. The Pyle is tinny  but you can eq it out . It doesn't distort and is unidirectional so  a lot of background noise stays out.  It comes with a 15 foot  cable.. the cable is xlr to  1/4 inch so  this would be a cool cheap  mic for karaoke parties .  It mounts on a standard stand and has the adapter for that other stand.  I would use this mic for practice and once it is mounted to a stand leave it.  I recommend a gooseneck,  The threads are plastic too.  They make a die cast shure knockoff  for around $69 that is decent. this one was $32 with shipping . Bottom line  if you want a cool  mic that is decent on a budget and can refrain  from  swinging it around  and smashing it  ... it's  worth  the $30. Oh  also  it has an  on  off switch .  I read this came with  a case.. This did not.  it was in a box  in  bubble wrap.  And worse case scenario if someone says you suck  you can  blame it on the cheap  mic.</span>

<span>Good sounding microphone! BUT... DO NOT use the included cable!!!<br/><br/>I saw this thing, and how inexpensive it was, and I was skeptical. But there were lots of good reviews, and it just looked so “vintage”, so “retro”... and the Amazon listing said “Free Returns”, so... nothing to lose...<br/><br/>I opened it up, plugged it in to a Behringer B205 powered speaker. I used one of my own XLR mic cables before trying the one that is included. It sounded very good, and seemed to have decent output. Then, just to see, I tried the cable they included... sounds about half as loud, gotta turn the level way up to hear anything at all. I have no idea why Pyle includes an XLR to 1/4” cable rather than a normal XLR cable.<br/><br/>So the sound is good, and the output is good if you don’t use their cable. I cannot comment on durability, since it just arrived; time will tell. But so far, I like this mic.</span>

Plug-and-play after five minutes of fiddling around including remembering to turn on Dragon. Two things: if you keep Dragon open on multiple PCs one microphone will broadcast to all of them at the same time which will alter the document that you don’t intend to be updating. Second, if usage battery down and won’t function until it has been charged again which is to say you can’t plug it into the charger and get speech right away. Won’t be functional again  until it has charged so you could be out of operation until it is sufficiently charged.

<span>I am a recording Engineer, Producer, Singer performer. I have been giving concerts Solo (15 years), Trio with two others (10 years) and Duet concerts (1 year) . . . All three are concurrent and ongoing. I have recorded and mixed and mastered three CDs. I use Bruel and Kjaer 4011, Bruel and Kjaer 4006, and AKG Perception microphones for recording. I have designed an amazing compact PA system that I assembled from components purchased that has outperformed all commercial PA systems costing 10 times more. The system fits into my Toyota car and puts out 800 watts per channel with a frequency response that extends from 20 Hz to 35 KHz!!  I use Shure Handheld condenser Wireless Beta 87A as well as the AKG digital wireless microphones for routine concert use. Occasionally I pull out my $600 Countryman wireless. I decided to try this because it was so inexpensive with a double ear "suspension"<br/><br/>I was simply amazed at the sound quality... yes, perhaps not the same quality as my countryman but pretty close to it!! And if any one is picky but has a good ear, you can easily fine tune this mic to match the frequency response of the Countryman. As Bob Carver, my Audio mentor and friend has often told me, as long as one starts with a good quality microphone, you can make it sound like any other microphone with the proper EQ!! This microphone does the job splendidly... so much so, I have purchased a total of 8 of these at $15 each. I use this exclusively for all my live concerts. I have also recommended this to quite a few musician friends.  The only problem I found is that this company does not make a carrying case for this. It is awkward to transport. So I had to buy a Pelican case 1170 for $37 in which I can carry 4 or 6 six of them.</span>

<span>Excellent.  Not a sonic replacement for an E6 or a WL-93, but pretty darn close especially for the price.  For 13.99 you can buy 30 of these instead of an E6.  Having been in audio for 3 decades I was helping with a meagerly budgeted sound design for a high school musical.  There was some investigation into name brand gear before I got involved.  With students we needed a low cost solution to get as as many kids miced as possible.  At this price the mics are almost disposable - and indeed during two dress rehearsals and a 3 night run the kids managed to toast at least 6 of the 30 mics I bought.  After having been through 2 musicals with students my suggestion would be to buy these and immediately remove and throw away the ear hooks.  The wire design where it clips onto the ear hook at the back of the neck was the problem.  Kids hastily adjusting the mic would slide the metal frame back from the end of the mic and put strain on the clip holding the wire the the frame.  This would cause rapid failure - sometimes only after one use as the strain breaks the wire.  The best solution is to lose the ear hooks altogether which leaves you with the mic only on the end of a gently bent stiff wire that is perfect length to run through the hair emerging above the forehead as a head mic.  Clip it into the hair discretely with small hair clips or bobby pins and you have an almost invisible mic!  Plus it sounds better than the mic at the side of the mouth.  I compared several of these and indeed most of the mud, woof and resonance from the chest/neck is gone when the mic is at the hairline.  Plus with it lying against the skull my guess is that you are getting a bit of sub 100hz bone conduction that helps define the voice.  I turned several of the ear hook mics into head mics after they started to show signs of impending failure - I reinforced each one with heat shrink tubing where the wire meets the frame - not a single one failed after that!  Also no mic got torn off during quick costume changes.  Some of the guys wanted to keep the mics as earhook booms.  The headset mics sounded better and didn't get ripped off their heads. The gain did have to be a bit higher on the head mics, but I didn't have any feedback problems.  The only feedback I had was consistently at 253 and 6.4k and that was during high volume checks and ringing out the system.  Not a single feedback problem was had during the shows.  In summary:  buy these, lose the wire frame, heat shrink and reinforce the connections and strain points. Get some moleskin tape &amp; tape the wire well to the back of the neck with enough slack. Then you will have a mic for every kid - every one has their own mic and you only have to swap body packs during scene changes  Trust me - If you try to skimp on the number of mics you purchase &amp; try to pass the mics back and forth you will destroy them quickly.  You will save more in the long run by using the head mic method.  Also the connectors are XLR 4 pin and work with Shure systems.  There were 5 Shure UGX pack already there that worked perfectly.  In addition I purchased 2 GTD audio UHF G747L systems (these are 3 pin and will require you to swap XLR connectors from 4 to 3).  I am completely blown away by these. I got them through another source other than amazon, but you can find them on amazon for $325.  The range on these is incredible - better than the Shure UGX.  Upon further investigation these are chinese knock-offs of the Shure SGX series.  I can't believe they are allowed to be sold and Shure hasn't gone after them.  Why?  They have the same LCD screen, the same functions - even the manual uses the same terminology.  They are total counterfeits - and they perform brilliantly.  So throw in a couple Behringer quad expander/compressor units, a five space rack bag and I was able to outfit the school with 8 extra wireless channels (for a total of 13 channels) and a total of 30+ mics for $1300. Every kid (who didn't trash their mic) could be heard.  Not bad for $1300 when the going rate for good UHF diversity is $500+ a channel.....</span>

<span>Unfortunately, I had to send all three mics back for a refund...here's why.  First..I think the quality of the mic and the feel is very good for the price...so I ordered three.  I'm an aerobics/boot camp instructor and personal fitness trainer, so i needed mics that i could trade out and that didn't cost a small fortune when one was cooked from sweat or otherwise defunct.  There was only one winsdscreen attached when the ad said there are two included windscreens. Other than that, they arrived quickly, almost as expected save for the windscreen...but none of them worked in our Shure system.  I had an old one that still worked fine, same mic. I ended up returning after having several looks to see if I was doing something wrong or possible ordered the wrong mics.  I did order the right mics and find it odd that all 3 were not opoerable.  I checked pins, cleaned our system, everything...so...maybe it was just a bad batch?  Anyone else experience this  issue.  I love these mics and would love to order again...especially for this [price.  I ended up buying another for 46 bucks.  yes...it is better quality all around but at 4 times more`cost per mic...Id much rather order these!  My question is can I do so safely?  Was this just an off coincidence.?  Could it be i missed something?  thanks!  Ted</span>

<span>I didn't have DPAs for a conference (I'm a sound engineer)... was quite surprised as I hate almost everything from Pyle.  these are about the same audio quality as a DPA.  no,I'm not kidding.  and I found other professional audio engineers who discovered these and agreed.  I would not recommend unless I was 100% sure that these are fantastic.  DPAs run 6 to 800 dollars.  these are under 50 dollars and have the TA4f connector for shure mic systems.  I bought a few more to carry in my audio engineers case.  At this price point, at least try it.  You will become a believer too</span>
