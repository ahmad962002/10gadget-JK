<span>This pen display is really good for its price, the main features are there and you can't deny that they work perfectly well. Here are the things that are kind of missing or that I would want: touch screen for zooming etc, wireless capabilities, maybe an extra button or two, and the adjustment of the height level is super basic so be prepared to use random books if your desk isnt the right height or angle. Really solid tablet, simple to use and connect.</span>

<span>As a disclaimer, I have returned my device because it did not meet my needs in the same way that a full portable tablet with pen would. That being said, this is an EXCELENT digital writing surface. I mainly used it with Microsoft Journal.<br/><br/>Pros:<br/>* Easy to use<br/>* Textured screen provides very satisfying tactile feedback (similar to high quality heavy paper)<br/>* Pen is comfortable<br/>* Functions as full additional display<br/>* Pen is super accurate, and the pressure sensitivity is great<br/>* Excellent customization options<br/><br/>Cons:<br/>* Screen is a bit dim<br/>* Pen only has one button<br/>* Not a touchscreen, so only one button makes navigating apps harder<br/>* After installing the drivers, my computer bluescreens on boot if the tablet is connected and initially it corrupted my background photo, which I had to restore from a backup (Windows 11)<br/><br/>Overall, this is a perfect entry level device, but may require a little technical know-how to get it going properly.</span>

<span>The screen is responsive. The pen is accurate. The color is good. I don't use this for note taking or anything but image editing and retouching, so I am basing everything on that.<br/>I do use a Spyder X Pro to color calibrate my monitors, including this Wacom. The default color settings were good, but not great. After calibrating, the color is much better.<br/>I can't give this a 5 star rating though I wish I could.<br/>First, the pen, while adequate, is not nearly as customizable as other pens. And there is no way to use another (Wacom) pen. I would love to have the ability to use other more feature-filled pens. I realize this is not a Cintique, but the pen seems no better than the screen-less Intuos I moved up from.<br/>Second, this takes an HDMI port at the computer. I don't have a problem with that by itself but it forces me to remove one of my monitors. I wish they had included some sort of a splitter for HDMI or adapters to use DVI or Display Port instead</span>

<span>I've had a few other versions of this tablet over the years. This particular one is really nice. Set up was a breeze.<br/><br/>I'm a psychotherapist and I use the tablet with Zoom Whiteboard during teletherapy. It's great for interactive games with young clients and with adults when I want to include visuals to emphasize a point. One thing to note is that you need to unclick the "Use Windows Ink" in the tablet's "mapping" properties screen if you experience difficulty when drawing in Zoom Whiteboard.</span>

<span>I am brand new to the drawing/sculpting scene and this was a great way to introduce myself to the basics. Very easy to set up after you make your account and verify everything. I am a big fan of the Bluetooth capabilities and the fact that I don't have to have any wires connected; I can sit back in my chair and relax while I use the tablet. I do wish there was a slot somewhere for the pen or an elastic to hold onto it but that's not enough of a deterrent to not recommend the product. Very happy with this purchase and would highly recommend to any beginners looking to get into this hobby.</span>

<span>I use this mainly to annotate Word documents, using the tools on the "draw" tab in Word. For that, it works well. It has fairly good control to allow me to mark or write where I intend. I would not say that I can make writing look great, or as good as I can with a pen and paper or even with an Apple Pencil on an iPad, but on the documents I am annotating, it is not important to make things look perfect.<br/><br/>I will say that this is not exactly plug-in-play (at least on a Windows machine). When you plug it in, Windows does recognize it and does some setup. But, I did have to go onto Wacom's site to download the setup file and manually run it. Once I did that, it opened a pretty typical setup dialog box and it was very easy from there. You do have to restart your machine halfway through the process, so it is best to close everything besides your browser before you start the setup. Once the setup is complete, it works very well. The pen comes with one nib already inserted and then there are three extra nibs stored in the base of the pen (which screws apart).</span>

One by Wacom drawing tablet is designed to make learning easier. Use the digital pen and tablet with your computer to draw, edit photos, express ideas, write formulas and interact in online classes in a way you can’t with a keyboard and trackpad. The simple USB connection to a Chromebook, Mac or Windows computer couldn’t be easier (some devices require a USB-C adapter) and the battery-free pressure-sensitive pen doesn’t require charging so it works the moment it touches the tablet surface. With Wacom’s 35+ years of digital pen development, you can count on One by Wacom as a high-quality, reliable product to last well beyond your school years. This product works with devices capable of running the latest version of Chrome OS and has been certified to meet Google's compatibility standards.

<span>Recommended by many, this tablet is amazing for osu!. The pen has some grip and can be held comfortably. The tablet has some extra friction which can help you aim with less shaking. Because of the lack of hardware smoothing, you may need to download tablet drivers and add an antichatter plugin (inside the drivers). This doesn't mean that it's bad, on the contrary, this is actually a good thing! Less hardware smoothing means you have more control over your aim and you won't have to worry about the software messing up your aim. Overall, I recommend this tablet 10/10.</span>

<span>Great basic tablet from Wacom, if you do not need all the bells and whistles.  I have used Wacom products for well over 15 years in the design industry.  I have gone through about 3 tablets on the higher end models over that period, but didn't really want to spend hundreds on replacing my last tablet.  I tried another brand out there and it just wasn't the same.  If you don't need the extra buttons and the wheel, this model is the best option for something simple for drawing and navigating around your screen like a mouse.  I highly recommend it if you are starting out with a tablet or just need something simple and reliable from Wacom.</span>

<span>I bought this for my son to use with his chromebook.  I must admit that I don't understand technology very well so I needed something that would be simple enough for him to use on his own.  This couldn't be easier.  The stylus doesn't have a battery or anything so you don't have to worry about charging it or plugging it in.  The tablet works with regular drawing programs that he already had on his chromebook.  Something cool that I didn't expect is that it is pressure sensitive.  That means that it creates darker, larger lines when he presses down harder just like a regular drawing pencil would.</span>

<span>Now, I don’t ever use tablets with no screens on them. Buuut, since I don’t draw with tablets like these, which honestly you should, I decided to try some games out. I pulled my old laptop out, booted up. Runescape and bam. I could sit far away. That there, was already worth it. Then, I opened Krita, did a few doodles, it was silky smooth. Now I’m thinking; Why is this so good. It’s a cheap tablet. I used to have an old Wacom tablet, and it just broke randomly. That tablet was jankier, and more expensive. This Pnboo tablet will not disappoint. Please do yourself a favor and get this if you’re looking for a quality tablet for cheap.</span>

<span>Wacom is pretty much the go-to company for tablet brands. There are a few other brands out there but they don't have the kind of reputation Wacom does. That doesn't mean they're bad, but it's hard to familiarize yourself with a new brand as far as new expensive hardware goes. This tablet is definitely worth it, but there are a lot of drawbacks that make it seem like it isn't. Much like a computer, if your only alternative is to not have one or be able to use one, then you feel kind of pressured to get it. When I bought this, there were a lot of surprises, some good, some bad.<br/><br/>THE TABLET ITSELF<br/>The physical machine is nice and sturdy. It uses a USB-C to connect, and the USB-C cable detaches from the other end, which is useful if you need to transport it so you don't have to coil the cord around it like some older Intuous tablets. The cable is used not only to plug it into a computer, but also to charge it. So you could plug it into your computer if it doesn't have bluetooth and use it that way, or you could plug it into a USB charging outlet and just juice it up if you're more of a bluetooth person. It does charge while plugged into the computer. It has a physical on/off switch too. Unlike the other smaller Wacom tablets it doesn't use a dongle to connect, but bluetooth. That may or may not be good for you if you have luck with bluetooth or not. It seemed to work on my Surface laptop just fine, but as of right now my desktop doesn't have bluetooth so I have to use it on a wired connection, and it seems to pick that up just fine anyway.<br/><br/>INTERACTION WITH THE COMPUTER<br/>Once you've gotten it plugged into your computer you'll need to spend a bit of time with the drivers to get it to work on your computer. I'm installing it on a Windows 8 desktop. If you are using an older tablet, I would recommend uninstalling the older drivers from the old tablet before installing the newest drivers from the Wacom website. You may not be able to have the old tablet and the new tablet on your computer at the same time. The Wacom drivers don't seem to coexist, and merely default to one section. If that section of drivers doesn't resonate with both tablets you'd be SOL.<br/><br/>DRAWING ON THE TABLET<br/>The pen from my old tablet doesn't work on the new tablet, and vice versa. I wouldn't expect it to, but just so you know. The pen holder also has a tool for removing the nib from the pen in case you want to change it out with a different one. And you'll definitely be doing that because the surface of the tablet by default has an incredibly destructive surface as far as pen nibs go. Every other reviewer has said it and they're not joking. The "marker" texture pen nibs seem to be stronger than the black regular ones, but who wants to feel like they're putting sharpie on cardboard? Normally I wouldn't have a problem with just buying new nibs because they're not so expensive, but this makes drawing difficult. Assuming you draw at an angle and not straight down onto the tablet, your pen will ultimately gain a flat edge to it. If you don't press the flat edge to the surface, the nib could rotate and screw up all of your precision lines, making it not worth having. Some people have said there are more indestructible rubbery pen nibs but I haven't found any that go with this tablet sold on either the Wacom website or on Amazon. There are some for the old tablets, but, y'know...this isn't old. Instead, a lot of people have been taping soft paper to the surface of their tablet and that seems to work for preserving the nibs, as well as the tablet surface, which seems to scuff easily. Not only that but it makes for a more pleasant drawing experience. According to my friends who own Wacom tablets, this works for even really thick flat items, including books and glass. Methinks this is because the pressure sensitivity is sensed not by the tablet but by the pen, so as long as the tablet sniffs the pen and the pen is being pushed down, it works. As for how the tablet seems to power the pen, beats me. Either way I'm going to try that "smooth surface" overlay they sell on the Wacom website, since other people say it's not always easy to get the "new surface" to adhere to the tablet.<br/> - Oh yeah and I can't get the tablet buttons to work. I'm just gonna use a Nintendo Switch Joycon and map it to keyboard shortcuts using XPadder. (If you have one, and you draw, try it; it works so well!)<br/> - One thing I fell in love with was the ability to use the Wacom tablet as a touchpad. The old Wacom tablets came with a mouse that was powered the same way the pen was, by the surface of the tablet itself. This works the same way except imagine it's a giant laptop touchpad and you don't need a mouse! It's compatible with all modern gestures including two-finger-scrolling, zooming, and programmable multi-finger clicking all the way to 11 fingers. You know, in case you have polydactyly. However if your hand tends to interfere with the pad while drawing, you can turn it off using a physical switch on the tablet itself, so no digital crap involved and it works instantly. Turn it back on if you get bored and want to finger on the pad for a while.<br/><br/>FRUSTRATIONS<br/>Now I had a LOT of problems getting this tablet to work at first. I'm not using ancient equipment either. I got so frustrated that I considered returning it. I know that coding drivers is probably a tedious task, and don't expect everything to be perfect all the time, but there are some egregious issues that Wacom doesn't even really want to acknowledge fixing. I spent an entire week sifting through every single topic on every single forum to try and get this thing to work and that was a nightmare. The forums were filled with chaos from people with working tablets whining that the people with not-working tablets were sick of trying to troubleshoot their tablet and just wanted to do some drawing! That's not Wacom's fault per se, but they don't take a proactive role in improving the driver experience for their tablets as well as we'd like them to, given we each paid $300 or more for this thing.<br/> - Initially the precision was unprecedented. You can definitely tell the difference on the new one versus the old one. Then I started to run into problems with the pressure sensitivity. In Photoshop CS6, I couldn't get pressure sensitivity to work properly at all. It would randomly draw thick lines and I couldn't replicate a pattern in the thick lines except for when I let my guard down. In fact to this day, I just stopped using it, and I'm not happy about having to get used to different programs like that. Why create such bloated drivers for your tablets if they aren't compatible with all the different programs out there? The tablet maker says it's the fault of the program despite that it didn't happen with other tablets, and the maker of the program says it's the fault of the tablet maker despite that the tablet works great in all other programs. Then you, the consumer, feel cheated out of your money. When you voice your opinion about it, the internet community at large thinks you're not entitled to voice your concerns. It's been a while since the first week of owning this thing, so I don't remember ALL the troubleshooting steps, but they got pretty bad. And some of them contradicted each other.<br/> - Make sure Windows Ink is off in the Wacom Tablet settings. If it's off, make sure it's on.<br/> - Turn off double-clicking in the Windows pen and/or mouse settings.<br/> - Turn off hold to right click in the pen settings.<br/> - Install the latest drivers, or reinstall the same drivers. Install specific drivers from an earlier generation, but install the old drivers first. Now uninstall the drivers completely and install the latest drivers, even if this is your first time installing drivers, drivers drivers drivers. Blah Blah Drivers Blah Blah Wacom website.<br/> - Enable/disable pressure sensitivity in Photoshop.<br/> - Enable/disable hardware acceleration in Photoshop. And/or enable/disable graphics card usage. (I believe one guy said it best, why pay $300 for a nice graphics card if you can't use it?)<br/> - Try using it on bluetooth instead of a direct wired connection<br/> - Check for Windows updates.<br/> - Disable the tablet buttons<br/> - Try a different nib<br/> - Try a different pen<br/> - Make sure touch controls are off while drawing<br/>Never really fixed Photoshop CS6. But using other programs, works real nice. I'm not so picky, I just like things to work out of the box when they're this expensive. I guess working a tech career should open my eyes to the fact that it'll NEVER be that way.<br/>Anyway, tablet's nice.</span>

<span>Wacom are the industry leader in graphics tablets, and with good reason.  All of their products are extremely high-quality, and the Intuos Pro line is no exception.<br/><br/>This tablet came with the actual tablet itself and USB power cord, the pen, a pen holder with spare nibs stored inside, and a set of colored rings that screw into the pen (so you can customize the pen).  I am going to review the major components of this individually, followed by my overall thoughts at the end.<br/><br/>THE TABLET<br/>The tablet is really top-notch.  It feels great, has a nice heft (not heavy, just solid), and looks professional.  It's mostly made out of metal.  It's extremely high-quality, and without a lot of the kinks that cheaper tablets or even older Wacoms have.  I have the Medium, and it has a huge drawing area.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, the drawing surface has a tendency to scratch really easily.  It comes with a medium texture sheet, which I later replaced with a smooth one, and the standard plastic pen nibs easily scratch both.  I don't carry it around, but I imagine if I stored it in a backpack or briefcase that it would also scratch up pretty fast.  You can buy replacement texture sheets online, and this tablet comes with a card with three tiny samples of each texture--smooth, medium, and rough--but these samples are so small it's basically impossible to get a feel for what drawing on the different textures is like.<br/><br/>The tablet has a set of hotkeys on the side, which you can flip to be on the left or the right side of the drawing area in the driver software.  I really like that feature, as I'm a lefty and keep my keyboard to the right of the tablet already.  You can reprogram each of the hotkeys, but it does get a little complicated--the driver software isn't too intuitive, but it seems like it can give you a lot of control once you figure it out.  I only changed the Command-Z hotkey to a Command-Option-Z hotkey for Photoshop, and that wasn't too difficult.<br/><br/>The other physical feature is a touch ring, which is, well, kind of dumb.  It's not very responsive, and only seems to do what it's supposed to some of the time.  In Photoshop it's set up to zoom in and out by default, and I almost never use it because I can just pinch on my Macbook trackpad and get a reliable result instead of a jumpy, terrible one.  You can also cycle through it to use different settings, like the canvas rotate in Photoshop, but it's still pretty jumpy and awkward.  Maybe I am doing something wrong, but now I pretty much never use it and sometimes find myself hitting it by accident and getting frustrated.<br/><br/>You can use the tablet either tethered to your computer or wirelessly.  I have never used it wirelessly outside of testing it out when I first bought it.  There's just a little bit of a lag that I found distracting, and since I use it with a laptop I have to set them both on the table anyways.  Wireless might be useful if you have a different setup with something like a PC connected to a television, but for me it wasn't worth the lag.  Latency is much better when plugged in, and you don't have to worry about battery life.<br/><br/>Installing the tablet on my Macbook was simple, although it does require you to sign up for a Wacom account to use the driver software.  After installation, it's pretty easy to jump right in to using the tablet.  As I mentioned before, the driver software is not very intuitive, and fiddling with the settings isn't super easy aside from a few simple ones like pressure sensitivity.<br/><br/>Finally, the tablet also functions as a touch input device for your computer--essentially a big trackpad.  You can turn this function on or off in the software, which is nice if you're like me and you brace your hand on the drawing surface.  It's not super great as a giant trackpad, and I prefer to just use my Macbook's which is more reliable.<br/><br/>THE PEN<br/>Some people may not know this, but Wacom has a patent on powerless pen technology.  Technically, the surface of the tablet acts as a magnet that reacts to a coil within the pen itself.  It's complicated stuff, but basically you never have to worry about charging the pen like you do with ones from other companies (including the Apple Pencil and the Microsoft Surface Pen).  To me this is the greatest benefit to getting a Wacom tablet over the cheaper alternatives--it's just one less thing to worry about, and it allows Wacom more freedom in the design of the pen itself.<br/><br/>As a result, the stylus is lighter in weight and can taper comfortably.  It's made of a durable-feeling plastic and the lower half of the pen has a rubberized coating for your hand.  There are two mappable buttons on the side along with the pen nib and eraser, both of which react to the tablet.<br/><br/>It works wonderfully.  Responses are quick and accurate.  It's easy to click on even the smallest of buttons in Photoshop, much more so than the average stylus on a phone or tablet.  The pressure sensitivity is great, and it's able to detect extremely minute shifts in pressure and tilt.  Pressure sensitivity is customizable in the included software, and it can take a little while to find your sweet spot, but the pen is always super responsive.<br/><br/>Lastly, there are a few different types of pen nibs you can purchase to really customize your drawing experience.  It comes with a plastic nib already in it, but there are more hidden in the pen stand.  The plastic ones are nice if a bit scratchy, and feel a bit like drawing with a sharp HB pencil.  They do wear down pretty quickly, especially if you tend to hold the pen in a certain angle most of the time.  I prefer the felt nibs, which are smoother but wear out even faster.  Mine came with a couple nibs of both types, so it's easy to experiment.  There's also a mythical third "flex nib" out there somewhere, but I could never find conclusively that it works with this pen.  And unfortunately, nibs are specific to certain product lines.<br/><br/>THE STAND<br/>The pen holder is a small dome with a thick metal base that unscrews to reveal storage for spare pen nibs.  It's nice and heavy, which is great if it lives on your desk, not so great if you want to travel around with it.  The stand has both a hole for you to insert the pen upright and a divot for you to rest the pen horizontally across it.<br/><br/>There's a small rubber ring on the bottom that keeps it from slipping around your desk, which is a nice touch.  In my opinion, it's a much better design than some of the older pen stands I've seen others use from Wacom.<br/><br/>The only issue I have with the stand is that it's very hard to open and close the bottom.  You have to rotate it just right, but there's not really a good place to grip it so it can be a bit challenging.  I usually take the whole stand between my palms and rotate my whole hands in opposite directions, which works consistently for opening it but is a little less reliable for closing it.  To close it you have to line it up the right way, which is a pain.<br/><br/>OVERALL THOUGHTS AND CONCLUSIONS<br/>This is a great product, and I believe it's truly the best graphics tablet you can buy today (not counting display tablets like the Cintiq).  Wacom really knows their stuff, which is why they're such a trusted brand and have been for decades.  It's a great-quality piece of tech with very little downside in terms of quality, and I think it easily outperforms the alternatives in terms of design and features.  It's just a joy to use.<br/><br/>But now we come to the biggest issue I have with this tablet, and with Wacom products as a whole: price.<br/><br/>This thing is just way too expensive.<br/><br/>At $350, it's more than half the price of an iPad Pro and roughly half the price of a new Microsoft Surface Pro, both of which are great products for creating art but which also do way, way more.  They not only have actual displays on them, eliminating the need to learn to draw without looking at your hand, but they also function as whole computers that do more than just run artist programs.<br/><br/>But this is a product mostly for professional use, so you may not be looking for an iPad or touchscreen computer.  That said, there are so many cheap alternatives that may not meet Wacom's standard of quality but that will get the job done now.  Huion is everywhere right now, and while I haven't gotten to test any of their tablets (though I'd love to) the consensus seems to be that they're getting better all the time.  Wacom will have some stiff competition in the artist space in the next few years.<br/><br/>On top of that, pen nibs, texture sheets, and carrying cases are all a good deal more than they should cost.  The pen nibs are probably the most egregious crime, because they seem to wear out with roughly 10-15 hours of drawing time.  You'd need a million of them if you're a drawing addict.  A worn-down nib will scratch the texture sheet of the tablet, particularly the smooth sheet.  I bought the smooth texture sheet thinking it would wear down the nibs more slowly, but instead it just means the surface of the sheet will wear out more quickly.<br/><br/>Wacom makes great stuff, but their price models kill me.  The Intuos Pro line is expensive, but not outrageous; something like a Cintiq is insane when compared to the alternatives.  Wacom gets away with it because their stuff is admittedly really good and because they have the patent on the most advanced version of this technology.  There's just a massive barrier to entrance and constant recurring costs.  I'd love a Cintiq, but I could never justify the price to myself when I could get a whole computer for the same amount.  As a professional I can see the utility, but as a hobbyist it doesn't make much sense.<br/><br/>All that said, I still would really recommend this product.  It's the best of the best, and a joy to use.  I'm extremely happy with my purchase overall.  If you're serious about your art or design work, this is the graphics tablet to get.</span>

<span>I want to preface this review by stating that I have never used anything like an actual Cintiq or similar. The closest comparison is my iPad Pro, which I had been using to creating fantasy art digital paintings for a good two years as of this review. My switch to a Wacom Intuous Pro was spurred by the fact that I'm now doing more complex illustrations and I really need the power of desktop Photoshop. Not iPad Photoshop, but he real deal app! I love Procreate, but Photoshop has the true power that I need when working on my drawings.<br/><br/>Yes, you can draw and compose and paint all day long on the iPad Pro with Procreate, but I needed more processing power and, quite frankly, more layers! I previously had a Wacom Intuous 3, like probably 12 years ago or so. I used it back then, but never got into digital painting like I have in the last two years. I have no problems going from using the Apple Pencil which draws directly on the screen vs. using the Wacom Pen 2, down on my desk with myself staring at the screen. In fact, I think there is a slight advantage for me personally because now I no longer have a tendency to hunch over the iPad. It just seems to work for me just fine.<br/><br/>I like to use my Wacom Intuous Pro M in tandem with the Apple Magic TrackPad 2. There are times when I connect via Bluetooth and my Wacom has a lag. I find that if I turn off the trackpad, then turn it back on, the Wacom pen and trackpad work without disrupting the either. I do find that I need to turn off my Magic Mouse entirely however. Yes, I like to work with both the Apple trackpad and mouse, I think it keeps my wrists from going bad and it just keeps my brain guessing, I suppose. You know, using multiple inputs for moving the cursor around and all.<br/><br/>All in all, I would recommend this to anyone, the Wacom Intuos Pro M. I had one of the smaller Intuos, and it was fine, but the Pro has much more sensitivity, thanks to the Wacom Pen 2. The nib does wear down faster than I remember, but it doesn't really bother me. I think the pressure can be adjusted, but I really haven't messed with it. Should beginners use this? I think for the level of control, levels of pressure, it might take away the frustration with using a cheaper tablet. It's like when I was learning to paint traditionally: when I went from student grade paints and brushes to pro grade materials, there really was a difference in how I could manipulate the paints and use a brush that actually held its point.<br/><br/>I imagine working on a Cintiq with Photoshop would be just as awesome or maybe even more. But, I will say that the level of control I feel I have using the Intuos Pro M in Photoshop to draw, sketch, paint is so spot-on, that using the Intuos Pro M will save me hundreds of dollars when compared to a Cintiq.</span>

<span>I am a long-tome Wacom user, use a tablet always, even as a mouse, and have used them all varations the last 20 years except Cintiq. This 2019/2020 Small Intuos Pro is one of the best i have ever worked on WHEN PLUGGED IN....when using Bluetooth wireless not so much.<br/><br/>PROS: Fantastic upgrade from my Wacom One (CTL-471), way more responsive and agile, movements not as chunky as Wacom One...needed a very small tablet footprint, this Intuos very similar to Wacom One specs (unlike previous Small Intuos version), and now I can rest my drawing hand on the tablet instead of the desk, very comfortable. Nice silky matte finish and enough shortcut buttons for me although i rarely use them. Have not noticed any pen nub wear issues or tablet scratching after 2 months. The stylus itself is surprisingly comfortable to hold/use over long periods of time, and power USB cord super long. Again, the size is amazing, very light, long rubber strips on back to prevent sliding, and no Bluetooth dongles. Touch features a plus but i dont use those much, leave them switched off (actual switch on side of tablet), but its there just in case. GREAT VALUE USED.<br/><br/>CONS: Bluetooth wireless is good when power near 80-90%, but once it gets to 70s it cuts out on my system (Mac Pro 6,1 using Catalina OS, tablet 2 feet away from computer) and needs a recharge to return to wireless. Also drains battery quickly when unplugged on Bluetooth, even when plugged in battery rarely gets to 100%, normally at 92%. Not sure why but very disappointing, was hoping to use wireless but very unreliable, i just have to leave it plugged in i guess. Stylus holder base is ok, shorter and heavier but I liked the old one better, takes up less space. Did not work good initially with Catalina, kept freezing out the cursor, had to restart to unfreeze, but found the fix - i describe the details at bottom of review. VERY EXPENSIVE FOR LIMITED BLUETOOTH/BATTERY LIFE.<br/><br/>OVERALL: definite must-buy if you need a super small responsive tablet with all the latest features. If you need a tablet for steady wireless workflow maybe not worth the upgrade. For $250 this tablet's wireless capabilities should be way more reliable than what it currently is. Honestly should get only 3 stars but the size and cursor response are so amazing.<br/><br/>MAC OS X BUG FIX: So, the cursor would freeze while hover-moving after a certain amount of time, which varied from a few minutes to a few days, very unpredictable. Once it froze only way to move cursor was to hold down pen nib to tablet and move around that way, but then you are click dragging or moving things everywhere, a real nightmare. Unplugging, replugging, turning touch on/off or going bluetooth never fixed it either - only fix was a reboot but then it would happen again and again. HERE IS THE FIX: go into System Preferences &gt; Security &amp; Privacy &gt; Privacy &gt; Input Monitoring &gt; UNCHECK the box next to WacomTabletDriver.app and lock/save changes. THAT FIXED THE CURSOR FREEZES! also, under Accessiblity "com.wacom.IOManager.app" box should be checked, IF not check it. ABSOLUTELY NO INFO ABOUT THIS BUG ON WACOM SITE, DAMNED SHAME, I RETURNED A PERFECTLY GOOD USED TABLET THINKING IT WAS A DUD, BUT WHEN THE NEW ONE DID THE SAME THING I KNEW IT WAS A SOFTWARE ISSUE, LUCKILY FOUND THE FIX....you're welcome Mac users!</span>
