<span>For context, I purchased this tablet on sale for $109.00. Additionally, I have been using Samsung Galaxy S series phones for a decade, previously used a Samsung tablet from about 2013-2015, and currently use both a Fire HD 8 (2020 model) tablet and a Fire 7 (2019 model) tablet. Finally, I purchased this because I needed a tablet with access to Google Play Services for a specific set of purposes.<br/><br/>First of all, it's important to keep in mind that the Galaxy A series is Samsung's "budget" line of tablets and smartphones, and this is the cheapest of their tablets. The performance is not going to be as good as the flagship Series S or Series Z devices; if you have, for example, an S22 as your phone, you should not expect the performance of this tablet, the screen, etc to match that. It also is not going to meet the specs and quality of iPads, Surfaces, or other high-end tablets. That being said, Android tablets overall are much better quality than they were several years ago, which my experience with this tablet has confirmed for me.<br/><br/>The screen is good--much better than I expected. Everything is clear and sharp, and there's basically no pixilation. It does have a lower pixel density than a lot of other devices, but more than most budget Android tablets. The screen can also be slightly difficult to view from certain angles, although that shouldn't be an issue for 99% of use cases; it can also be a bit difficult to see in brighter lights. In terms of physical qualities, it's basically the same as the screen on my S21.<br/><br/>The sound is also better than I expected. It doesn't seem to carry as far as other devices--once again, not a huge issue--but it's loud and clear. The fact that there's an audio jack is appreciated, and one can always connect a speaker or headphones via bluetooth.<br/><br/>The extra 1GB of RAM compared to my Fire HD 8 is definitely noticeable in most cases, although this is still not what I would call a speedy device. If you're just watching video, listening to audio, and reading, this will be irrelevant to you outside of saving a second or so when you open an app, pull up the keyboard, or turn on the tablet. I have not played any games on it, but I assume that more demanding ones would have some noticeable difficulties on this.<br/><br/>Battery life seems great so far. The tablet supports fast charging, but the included charger does not.<br/><br/>The tablet is lightweight, although compared to my Fire HD 8, it is not as comfortable to hold. The materials used are also very nice, and it doesn't look or feel like a budget tablet. It's small enough that fitting it into most bags or purses shouldn't be difficult. The fact that storage is also expandable up to 1 TB is appreciated. The charging port is USB-C, which is basically standard nowadays, although many budget devices still use micro-USB, so it's worth mentioning.<br/><br/>The cameras are adequate, and are fine for Zoom, Skype, and other video sites. I have not used the microphone, but I assume it's also serviceable.<br/><br/>There are seemingly some interesting options to connect this to a Samsung phone, although I am not using those. Still, this could be a nice option for some people.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, there do not seem to be very many good cases available for this model. There do appear to be a lot of "heavy-duty" cases for it though, which is nice if you're purchasing this for a young child.<br/><br/>Overall, if you can get this on sale--especially if you *have* to have access to Google Play Services or otherwise can't or don't want to use Fire OS--this is definitely a great choice for a tablet. It will get updates and remain usable for far longer than similarly-priced and cheaper Android tablets from Onn, Chinese manufacturers using the names of old American brands, and the like. That being said, if you're primarily looking for a device for consuming content--which is what the overwhelming majority of people use tablets for--I'd still recommend the Fire HD 8, especially during one of the many times per year that it goes on sale, as I don't feel that the differences are worth the extra $50.00-$110.00 the A7 Lite will cost. Still, this is probably the best inexpensive Android tablet on the market today, and is a fantastic option to consider if you're looking to purchase one.</span>

<span>got this for my nephew so he could play some games he doesn't have available on his fire tablet, memory size could be better but not bad for the price.

With the Flex Stand (formerly the Multi-Stand) you can move your Pro Camera—the world’s most advanced baby monitor with computer vision technology—from room to room or take it with you on the go (think playdates, travel, other caregivers’ homes) to get a 130° view in seconds. That means you can monitor your baby and capture those unmissable moments–almost anywhere, anytime.

<span>My wife and I were looking for a camera for our new born son and we knew that we needed a camera that we can use while we travel.  We frequently travel so we needed a camera that we can places.  We came upon this multi-stand as we were looking at the Nanit.  We have been using the stand mostly while we travel (go to parents, or in-laws houses) and we love it.  It is really convenient to pack in our suitcase as it does not take up much space.  The setup is pretty easy as all you need is an outlet and wifi.  The only thing about this stand is that it does not go above the crib like the original stand that comes with the nanit.  When we travel we usually put this on a table or night stand just to capture the noise, so when we hear our son crying we can go to the room.  This stand can be used for a long time as when our son gets older we can put in his playroom and monitor him.  Overall, a great accessory for the nanit!</span>

<span>These are definitely not my favorite swaddles and given how expensive they are, I expected more.<br/><br/>Pros:<br/>-fabric holds up well in the washer<br/>-it has a two way zipper (pretty much the best thing about it)<br/><br/>Cons<br/>-the little zipper cover at the top is too small so it was constantly poking out<br/>-because of the way it’s sewn the zipper always ended up in the front under my daughter’s chin as she moved. Which was especially annoying given the zipper was poking out.<br/>-they’re expensive<br/>-There is no way to adjust the neck hole so if you have a wriggler then you should expect for a shoulder or arm to always be coming out.<br/><br/>Overall I would not recommend these unless your baby doesn’t move when they sleep.

<span>We had originally purchased the Miku monitor because I wasn’t thrilled about Nanit’s added cost of wearables but after we weren’t able to even get Miku to connect and then NICU doctor recommended Nanit, we finally purchased. We’ve been super happy with the performance. Our son had 2 episodes where he momentarily stopped breathing after coming home (reason for being in the NICU as a preemie) and Nanit caught both episodes. It’s definitely expensive to continue sizing up in the wearables but we’re now addicted to the peace of mind of knowing his breaths per minute. We absolutely recommend if you’re looking for a smart monitor and/or you’ve had a baby in intensive care.</span>

<span>We are an Android family. We are a Samsung family. We have Samsung smart phones, and watches, so when my wife's old iPad finally gave up the ghost, I asked her if it would be OK to replace it with a Galaxy tablet, which made sense to me. We are both retired so I searched for a tablet that fit our budget and at the same time would fit her needs. She mainly streams and saves recipes, so I purchased the 128 GB model since it also included the 4 GB RAM, instead of 3 GB. What a tablet. The screen is bright, the sound with the quad speakers is fantastic, and it is quick. I have yet to set it up so she can make, and receive phone calls on it, which I think she will like.<br/><br/>A day after we received it there was a huge update. It is now running Android 12, the same as our phones. The only disappointment I have found so far is not being able to connect her watch to it. I hope<br/>Samsung addresses this in the future.<br/><br/>If you are in the market for a high-end budget tablet you might give the A8 a second thought. I believe you will be pleased.</span>

<span>I pretty much concur with the other reviewers about this tablet. It's a good basic tablet with a decent picture and good battery life. One outstanding feature, the audio! This the best audio I have ever heard, stereo no less, coming from a tablet.<br/><br/>Now to the downsides. Do not buy the 32gb model if you can at all avoid it. It is slow with very little storage for programs. I've read many complaints about Samsung not allowing you to store programs on a micro sd card.  This isn't strictly true as you can store certain programs on the micro sd card if the program itself allows it. Unfortunately, most programs don't allow it. Get all the base storage you can.<br/><br/>To the more important feature...the wifi. I was perplexed as to why my download speeds on this unit were so slow...roughly a third of any of my other devices including much less expensive Amazon tablets. After extensive google research, I found an answer if a slightly inconvenient one. If you cycle the airline mode button (on then off) bammo, the speed jumps to a normal if not breathtaking level. It works every time, who knows why other than you are in essence resetting the wifi.<br/><br/>All things considered, I'm keeping it especially after the recent Amazon sale.</span>

<span>My stepson loves his tablet. It’s so much better at evening than his last tablet which was the latest ONN tablet from WM. Better screen, camera, display, faster and plays games that lagged on his last tablet. No longer had to play on the lowest setting graphics. I know it’s not the flagship Samsung tablet but I don’t see why anyone would need the flagship honestly. This tablet is fast, looks good, works good and has great speakers and battery life! The tablet is worth the money. Glad me and my wife got it for him. He needed an upgrade and that’s exactly what he got.</span>

<span>I do not mean "Wild" kindly, but I'll get to that shortly. Sorry for the long read, but I have a lot of thoughts about this particular product to inform you, the end-user of your purchasing decision before you commit a purchase, and as a responsible citizen of the Internet, I've heavily tested the tablet hands-on to see what I can make it do, how I can make it work and where Amazon's hires could improve the overall experience for a multi-adult household.<br/><br/>The tablet itself is functional. What else is there to say about it? Inside a home or building, so long the sun isn't shining directly on it the display is bright, with a clear, crisp display and along with a decent battery much bigger than your current handheld mobile device, you also get anywhere between a mediocre and acceptable tablet use experience, depending on how much money you hand to Amazon. I painfully regret not going with the Fire HD 10, but I am a bit of a cheapskate and after having seen what comes with the Fire HD Kids' Pro 8 through an encounter with a daughter of my mother's friend, I figured the Fire HD 8 Plus would be the same exact experience — and I can happily say, it is.<br/><br/>The inclusion of a three-pole phone socket for headphones and TF / micro SD slot for extra storage practically makes it the ideal tablet computer… until you try to use it as a multi-user tablet computer. But we'll get to those gripes later. First impressions of the hardware makes it seem like the absolute perfect device for personal and work use, domestic and abroad. A simple tablet with great features. Except for a GSM / SIM slot but if you already have a mobile handheld, the Fire can use wireless tethering whenever the tablet needs access to the Internet where WiFi isn't available, and it can do calls via WiFi so that's something if your friends aren't using any of the supported social network platforms available through Amazon's app market.<br/><br/>Fire OS on the other hand, that's uhm — fun. Yes, fun. If you receive nothing else from this, should you be the sole adult of the tablet, then you have nothing to worry about. Everything just works — for you. For anyone else? Yeah, nah. Show mode is honestly a great inclusion, as well Alexa Hands-Free — it's like if you have a general-purpose tablet, Amazon Show desktop unit and phone (which can only do calls via WiFi) for what was at the time of Prime Day anywhere between sixty and eighty dollars depending on device capabilities. What a bargain!<br/><br/>…For the primary user. Second adult? Nah, can't do Show Mode, Alexa Hands-Free or WiFi calling. But children can do calls with approved contacts and permission from their parents! That hardly makes any sense — if you're not a child you don't get to make calls beyond the primary profile? Why? Speaking of kids, if you think that kids' launcher or adult settings will let you move off all of the kids' apps to an SD card, ha ha nope. So your child will very likely make using the tablet almost impossible after they stuff the internal storage with nothing but pointless games.<br/><br/>For a couple, it makes even less sense to buy this for the intent of using voice recognition features. Sure, auto guy and shop girl can keep their profiles separate, but only one of them get the privilege of using all of the tablet's features. A second adult profile is like a grown-up kid, and feels almost demeaning, which likely means whoever wears the pants between two people will be the one with the primary account which does everything. And what if they want to share applications? There's no easy way to do this beyond reinstalling them on the other profile. I've looked, and there seems to be no way of easily sharing apps between adult profiles which especially makes installation of such things as Google Play a major drag without third-party guidance and tools.<br/><br/>It's an Amazon device, so of course it will advertise Amazon everything — even Washington Post. If you don't use that service, too bad can't disable. If you don't care about Amazon's other services, too bad shove it in a folder on the Fire Launcher. Without tinkering beyond what Amazon allows you to do, it kind of makes using the tablet a terrible experience being inundated with all of these Amazon-owned things at once, and for some people the constant upselling is enough to warrant a return.<br/><br/>If you can get over all of that — and again, if you are the sole adult of the tablet, none of the above save for the upsells are really an issue — then you have yourself a capable and handy little Android-based tablet which will do almost everything you want. A solid product with a mediocre and terribly flawed OS, but one if you've committed your entire life to Amazon may be welcome. As I exhibit no such brand loyalty I'm exceedingly annoyed, but all of the thorns and papercuts are nothing a little bit of tinkering cannot cleave and become rid of.<br/><br/>EDIT 07/06/21.1: Minor correction, seems like while four-pole may fit, I can't use external mic with the tablet or Fire OS doesn't disclose how to do this.<br/>EDIT 07/06/21.2: Grammar and error corrections</span>

<span>Good: Inexpensive, high battery life, adequate performance, USB-C charging<br/><br/>Bad:  Hard to hold, thick and heavy for screen size, unacceptable button placement, wireless charging turns device into echo show with ads - a feature I would pay to remove!<br/><br/>I have owned three Fire HD 8 tablets and each generation has gotten more annoying to use because of compromises in the design intended to make them less expensive to produce.  I am extremely happy that Amazon has decided to market this upgraded version with 3 GB of RAM because that is now the minimum needed to run Android or Fire OS smoothly. The 1.5 that came with my second Fire HD8 never worked - it just isn't enough anymore, whereas the 2 GB that came with my first HD8  waa plenty for that era.  I think Amazon was foolish to make that change on the base HD8 because of the added frustration to the end user, but at least there is a choice to upgrade to this "plus" version with its frustration-free 3GB setup.  Is the experience as smooth or responsive as even the least expensive iPad?  Certainly not.  But those start at $400 and this was closer to $120.  What I really want is a $185 option that combines this specification or better with the physical design and form factor of earlier Fire HD8 generations, because when it comes to physical design this generation of Fire tablets is extremely annoying!  I am sure the changes are all designed to minimize cost but please find a better to do that than to put the power and volume buttons so close together with such a similar size and feel.  It is far too easy to press the power button to begin with because it protrudes to far from the case and doesn't have a very strong spring, but when you put it right next to an identical feeling volume button that is just unacceptable!  There is good reason why almost every phone and tablet in the world has these buttons in different locations ( often opposite sides or ends of the phone.)<br/><br/>I happen to believe that it probably would work to have both buttons on the same end as the charger and headphone jack but not if you put them this close together, and give them exactly the same tactile feel and the same overly light spring rate. Please at least recess the power button, use a different surface texture and a stiffer spring. Or better yet move it to the opposite corner where the headphone Jack is now.<br/><br/>And for users with the current, unfortunate design you could eliminate the worst effects with a software update. Just modify the software to require a longer press of the power key before it shuts down the display.  If a one-second press were required then it would eliminate 90% of the instances when I have accidentally shut down the screen trying n to change the volume.  With no security options other than a pass code, tis means I almost every time I try to adjust the volume while listening to a podcast or watching a video I have that experience interupted and I end up having to enter my pass code and physically restart what I was listening to just because I tried to adjust the volume.  This design choice just doesn't work.  Fix it, Amazon!<br/><br/>Another cost saving design choice is that Amazon has allowed the HD8 tablets to get thicker each generation, which I agree is probably reasonable.  But between the thicker body and the much smaller bezel compared to previous generations, I am finding this version much more difficult to hold.  I actually think the sensitivity of the screen might also be a factor because if I put fingers on the front edge if the glass at all this registers as a touch. So to prevent that my fingers must stay on the plastic, and there just isn't enough plastic on the front bit the tablet to get a good grip.  That gives the impression of the tablet being heavier and more awkward than it probably is.  And again this could be an issue that might be addressed with software if the screen sensitivity could be decreased a bit to reject unintended "touches" at the edges ( in this case beyond the edges). of the screen.<br/><br/>My final gripe is going to be about the behavior of the device when put on a wireless charger.  Oddly, when I want to use a wireless charger my intention is to actually charge the device.  It is not to turn my tablet, for which I paid extra to have ads removed from the lock screen into an always on Echo Show with advertising!<br/><br/>I'm sure there are some people who might actually use an Echo Show and for them this must feel like an amazing value.  Like getting a second device for free.  But I just want it gone.  I would never willingly use, much less purchase, an Echo Show, particularly one with a working camera, because I can't accept the privacy and security risk. And I certainly don't want another device showering.me with advertising.<br/><br/>That said, I don't object at all into Amazon including the Echo Show functionality with the tablet, or even having it run by default when you connect it to a wireless charger, but there needs to be clear documentation about how to control this feature and how to turn it off both permanently and temporarily.  Without that I am actually losing two features I specifically paid for on this tablet, wireless charging and freedom from advertising.  Please do a much better job explaining this feature and how to control it as you update the device software</span>

<span>I am a fan of Amazon's tablet offerings and have been for years. I do also have iPads, which I use for music related apps. but for everyday uses the Fire HD tablets are a very smart option.<br/>What I like:<br/>1. Price - you get a lot of computer for relatively little money<br/>2. Screen &amp; Speakers - Amazon has improved the resolution and brightness of their tablet screens over the last few years that rival Apple, Samsung, etc. Movie audio is crisp and loud enough, even streaming music isn't bad on the built-in stereo speakers<br/>3. Battery - on the 8" and 10" Fire HD tablets you will get impressive battery life, especially if you take the effort to power off if you won't be using it for a few days. The 7" tablet does not have quite the same battery life however, from my experience<br/>4. Everyday uses - Amazon's browser, email, office, games, entertainment, audio books, music, etc integrated apps are well thought out and work intuitively and efficiently on these tablets.<br/>5. Entertainment and shopping - if you're a Prime member the Fire HD tablet is really a no-brainer, especially if you watch Prime or other prescription streaming video or do any amount of shopping at Amazon or Whole Foods<br/>6. Alexa and Smart devices - the Fire HD tablets easily work together with your home Smart devices, such as Ring doorbells and security detectors and are quite versatile too. You can sync them with your Echo devices, TVs, security video cameras, etc. You can even use them to communicate with other Fire tablets in your home - almost like a video intercom system<br/>7. Updates - Amazon is always improving the functionality of their devices so new features often appear with OS updates. Basically you're getting more than you paid for over time.<br/><br/>What I don't like so much:<br/>1. Fire OS - Amazon has done a great job with their operating system but still has some work to do as far as multi-tasking, efficiency and compatibility with certain file protocols. Also the internal filing system and access to the SD card for storage is a little clunky. Transferring files from one device to another can be confusing<br/>2. Camera integration - the Fire HD tablets have decent cameras (well, the front one is decent) but they don't seem to play that well with the included photo app - and the filing system apart from Amazon Cloud is again, somewhat non-intuitive. This is something that obviously can be remedied with software updates, hopefully soon.<br/>3. 3rd party applications - Amazon is pretty strict about which apps can be used with the Fire OS (you cannot download from GooglePlay) so there are likely a few apps you like that will be unavailable - unless you hack the tablet to run as a straight-up Android device, which defeats the purpose of having an Amazon device in the first place. So..<br/><br/>That pretty much covers it from my perspective. The Fire HD 8" &amp; 10" are a real bargain in the Android-ish tablet market, IMHO. I really love mine and use them daily and believe you will love yours too!</span>

Breathing Wear works exclusively with the Nanit Plus camera to monitor your baby's breathing motion without putting sensors on your baby. Contains one large Breathing Band suitable for babies 3-24 months old or 13-30 lbs. "The Breathing Band can be used over most garments, as long as you can place the Breathing Band underneath the baby’s arms. It is imperative you place the Band around their torso and under their arms so that it stays secure, otherwise the Band could pose a suffocation or strangulation hazard. Avoid dressing your baby in thick garments or sleeping bags like the Merlin Magic while using Breathing Wear, as the thick fabric prevents motion from being detected. In order for breathing motion monitoring to work properly, the Breathing Wear pattern must be in clear sight of the camera with nothing obscuring the pattern. Always be sure to follow safe sleep practices."

There have been multiple times where I open my Nanit to peek at my baby and he is just facedown sleeping. If I did not have this, I would panic and immediately run in to move him. With using Nanit, I can see his breathes per minute and feel at ease knowing that Nanit will alert me if there is an issue. My baby has also never seemed to mind that his was sleeping with it on.

<span>Picked this refurb up on the special, and it is a great value.  You really can't beat it for the price.  The only very minor complaint I have is that there isn't a Fire app for Fox Sports, however you can still watch live sports on the Fox Sports website using the Silk browser so it isn't a big deal.  Given the price though on special, this get's 5 stars from me.</span>

<span>I like almost everything about this tablet.  The only con is the adds.  They are a bit annoying.  But for the price and quality of the unit, I can deal with it.</span>

<span>I bought this tablet for my grandson's birthday, and he loves it. He has used it every day and has had good experiences with it. The software is stable and fast, and his downloads work very well, he likes to play games with it as well as other functions like homework, and it has proven to be a very good little tablet for the money.</span>
