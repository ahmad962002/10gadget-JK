<span>I bought the iPad 9 because I had decided it was time to upgrade from my iPad Air 2 that I bought about 8 years ago. Honestly, while I could have gotten a different brand that cost less, I was impressed that my tablet had lasted so long. The battery had started to noticeably drain faster but that was the only problem I was having with it. After seeing how well Apple makes their products, I decided to stick with them when making my purchase. So far, the iPad 9 is performing well for me. I enjoy the screen resolution/response and it's bigger than my previous tablet. I mostly watch YouTube, check emails, and use it for things that my phone's screen is too small for. But, I've been wanting to get started with digital drawing and I feel that this tablet will be enough for me to get my feet wet. Maybe I can get another 8 years before upgrading again.</span>

<span>Ok..little old lady here, whose working life consisted of nothing but years and years of Windows, android phones, etc.  Just in last several years jumped hesitantly into Apple (phone, Ipad mini, etc.)<br/><br/>LOVE LOVE LOVE my iPad mini but, thought..might be time to think about replacement..so, I saw the great price on this 10 inch tablet and thought I'd take a chance.  I am much more partial to the mini sized tablets, but thought I'd go for it...soooo, even after reading all the bu.......t comments here, thought I'd try, if i didn't like it., I'd return it.<br/><br/>  1. Delivered on time, yayyy!<br/>  2. Package well protected, sealed, unblemished...perfect condition (and yeah..no fingerprints on<br/>  screen)<br/>  3. Ipad fired right up...70% charged<br/>  4. Ipad immediately began transferring info from iPhone that was sitting nearby.  Yayyyyy!!  No need for<br/>  reams of books, booklets, warnings, etc., etc.!!<br/>  5. EVERYTHING transferred from iPhone and IPad Mini...and I still had some 15 gig storage left on new<br/>  64 gig iPad  (just remember ...this is for my entertainment...not for work with diagrams, idiotic work<br/>  related emails about cleaning up my workspace, or 20 specs for items no one will ever use)<br/>  6.  Did a test run...everything worked exactly as I required, expected.<br/>  7.  Ultimate test...watched old Morse/Poirot shows I have in Prime..excellent quality!  love love love<br/>  8.  After 8 full hours...I had to recharge for a bit before I went to bed.  (charged fairly fast!)<br/><br/>sooooooo...<br/>I'm keeping this jewel!!!!!<br/><br/>Risk is there...evidently, if you believe the nutso crowd and their comments here.  It's a GREAT item, it's a fabulous deal, Christmas is coming...or if you need to have a worthy backup..,...DO IT!!!!</span>

<span>I am so happy with this purchase. Although there were some negative reviews about the condition in which they arrived, I cannot complain.  It was packaged properly in the delivery box, the iPad arrived in a sealed, brand-new box.  I am thrilled I was able to purchase a 9th generation for this price.  Was very easy to set up...Apple walks you through the entire process and I couldn't be happier.  So happy I went back to an iPad.</span>

<span>Decided to buy this when the last Prime day deals was going on last month. I don’t regret it at all. I had a fire tablet before but I just couldn’t get used to it for some reason. I guess since I’ve always had Apple products, I’m more used to using them. Screen is great touchscreen. Even with the protector on it. Feels like it’s not even on there. Not much else to say about this. Definitely recommend to anyone wanting to buy a tablet</span>

<span>Literally the best tablet I’ve ever had, really nice glove that fits my hand and this is also my first time having a battery less pen. I have used this for osu for at least a few months and can’t be any happier. I’m not the one to be asking if it has any latency or any of that because I’m not pro but imo it’s amazing. Now for drawing, I don’t draw at all but when I used it without a driver there was MAD latency. Im very sure I used it wrong but yea…</span>

<span>Update: Started glitching like crazy right before our return window closed. Unfortunately, we returned it.<br/><br/>Prior to the Leap Pad, we had a kids kindle 7. Compared the kindle, the Leap Pad has way more parental controls. This is a plus for me. The kids kindle unlimited content was showing my kid all kinds of stuff despite me explicitly blocking certain key words. The Leap Pad will allow your child to use Leap Search which connects to the internet. You can pre approve websites in the parental controls and even block certain areas of a website. I approved Outschool, PBS Kids, Lalilo, Explorify, etc. If you approve Outschool you also have to approve Zoom and log in. The only downside of the leap pad is that you cannot add “normal” apps. You can only buy apps through the Leap Frog store. They are priced similarly to what a game cartridge would be for the old Leapsters. You can also buy shows like Octonauts and RescueBots for the about the same price as a DVD. Or you can pre approve Netflix on Leap Search. The stylus on this is awesome when playing games, especially Leap Frog Academy. (The LF Academy is similar to ABC Mouse, it is not the equivalent of Amazon Kids Unlimited.) The built in stand is a bonus. The battery is garbage, it lasts about an hour fully charged. Bottom line, if you’re looking for an inexpensive kids tablet that’s easy to lock down, this is it. Screen quality/graphics are actually clearer than the kindle 7.</span>

<span>Pros: We bought this for our 2.5 yr old daughter about 2 months ago, and it’s been a big hit with her. She’s able to navigate almost everything on her own. The Academy apps (monthly subscription) are pretty good. She learns so much from them and I love that.<br/>It’s really durable. We put a screen protector on it. Our toddler is ROUGH with everything and so far nothing has broken or even scratched. The battery also lasts a pretty good while.<br/>Cons: The free apps are pretty lame and she never plays with those at all. One is a calculator, another is a notes app,  a few are demos- but then there are some games too. It’s more worth it if you pay for the Academy apps.<br/>The apps are visually ugly. Which I guess doesn’t matter at all, but I was a little surprised by how generic all of the animation is.<br/>Overall this was a good purchase.</span>

<span>I got a replacement and it's exactly what I wanted! Lightweight and the learning curve isn't so bad if you've never used a chromebook before, it only took me a few days to get used to it. It's very different from a normal computer and only good for light browsing and writing, I also got a large micro sd card for storage since it's barely got any, but I love it!<br/><br/>OLD REVIEW:<br/>The laptop itself is adorable, I love the look and feel of it, but I was either sent a broken computer or it was broken by the postal service handling it too roughly. It booted quickly, at least, so my disappointment was immediate. :(<br/><br/>I've put in for a replacement, so I'll be updating my review once that one arrives in two days.</span>

<span>I am one who will buy a product based on reviews and all of the reviews here were giving this chrome book such high praise, I figured it’d be worth a shot.<br/>What did I need? Something slim, lightweight, easy to transport, something with speed and CHEAP.<br/>I was in desperate need of a new laptop b/c mine is a dinosaur, very clunky and sloooow. Being in school is what really got me looking and trying to save up for a MacBook was never going to happen on my student budget. This little Lenovo chrome book is quick, sleek, and slim. And most of all, only $100. No touch screen but the battery life is incredible. I use it a few hours every day and only have to recharge it every 3-4 days. I use this chrome book for Google docs, internet surfing/research and e-mail. With that being said, I’m not using much storage so I can’t speak to that.<br/>GREAT buy as it was everything I needed for an unbeatable price.</span>

<span>This is my first Chromebook, and I've been using it for two days.  The battery life is amazing so far; it does appear to be 10 hours. Reading the reviews, it seems like a wide range of experiences, and I feel fortunate that mine works well so far.<br/><br/>It was very easy to set up. I saw 11.5 in the description, but the actual display screen is 10 inches. It isn't a touch screen, and the keys are dark gray, not black. This was an impulse purchase after getting a new laptop a few days ago. My 6 year old Dell would work no longer, and I got an expensive gaming laptop. It was my second one, but I was not expecting it to get so hot, with a noisy fan. The battery life is about an hour. To feel more comfortable, I wanted a Chromebook for email, YouTube, and Amazon videos. So, this is doing what I want it to.<br/>I will likely get more used to having no delete key, instead the alt+backspace key is used for that function.  I was surprised when my bookmark bar appeared with bookmarks from 2013 on. I've deleted many of them in the bookmark manager.<br/>My main dissatisfaction is the disappearing vertical scroll bar. In some emails, you can select "view in<br/>browser". I would be more frustrated if I didn't have the laptop available. There might be a fix for that; I haven't researched yet.<br/>I purchased mine when it was 52% off, which is worth it.  Buying electronics is risky. I've been very disappointed in the past, which is why I'm relieved and accepting of the machine I got.<br/>Almost everything has become more expensive, and reasonable expectations seem to be in order. With two days use, I'm not regretting my purchase.</span>

<span>I was curious about Chromebooks &amp; wanted to give one a shot. I looked this one over, and Alice helped me with questions I had. (She was great BTW).<br/><br/>I'm really enjoying this little Chromebook. It's lightweight, has crazy battery life (about 10 hrs). I'm still learning all that Chromebooks can do, but it was definitely worth the purchase. 2 Thumbs WAY UP! :)</span>

<span>Works fantastic.  "Only issue is that pump straw doesn't go low enough into the bottom of the glass container and at least 10 days of makeup are wasted and have to toss away."  I've take it apart with pliers once but it's not worth the hassle.  I just buy another bottle.  I just don't like wasting it.  If they could improve the length of the straw into the bottom, it would be even more fantastic!</span>
