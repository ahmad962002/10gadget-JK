<div class="slideshow-container">
<blockquote><em><div class="a-row a-spacing-small review-data"><span class="a-size-base review-text review-text-content" data-hook="review-body">
<span>I have really small pills to cut so this was basically a necessity as a knife was not doing it. I would say out of 10 pills 1 maybe cuts not all the way through. But it does it enough where I can just break it at that point it’s just not as clean line halves as the other ones</span>
</span></div></em></blockquote>
<p> </p>
<blockquote><em><div class="a-row a-spacing-small review-data"><span class="a-size-base review-text review-text-content" data-hook="review-body">
<span>This little item is a gem when needed but not always spot on 100% accurate.  But thats okay depending on how precise you need to split a tablet (tried it on a few asprin and Ibuprofen tabs before I cut any important medications to make sure how it worked, and accuracy)  the blade i guess deflects a real tiny bit and sometimes the tablets get cut on a slight angle so might appear bigger than half on one side less than half on other, sometimes tabs that are spherical do not lay in the "V" perfectly flat and again can cut like a 55%/45%  Which in most cases wont really matter but if this is super important for you and your particular medication, then I found you can gently flex the top before closing it to shove the blade through the pill and get a more accurate cut.  What is a really nice little feature is when you cut it, half gets trapped inside and the other half comes out a small window and you do not have to touch it, you can drop it in a dispensing cup for your patients and never handle the pill by hand.  Due to the accuracy issue Ill give this a 4 star, but if I could give it a 4 1/2 I would.  For the price, You cant beat this, its tiny too, so easy to slip in your bag, or rubber band it to your toothbrush case or toiletries bag etc.  Clear plastic, solid, but if you are not gentle with it, it will crack and break.  So just don't need to squeeze it hard, blade does the work for you, minimal pressure needed to cut through the hardest pills I have found so far.  Hope this helps anyone that is looking for something like this.  Stay Well Everyone!</span>

<blockquote><em><div class="a-row a-spacing-small review-data"><span class="a-size-base review-text review-text-content" data-hook="review-body">
<span>Does as intended, but don't think it will hold up. The pill it was bought for are 1" and hard compacted meds. Takes a little extra effort to crack them. This cutter may not be as strong as a device needed for these pills. So far it's working. Only time will tell how long it lasts.</span>
</span></div></em></blockquote>
<p> </p>
<blockquote><em><div class="a-row a-spacing-small review-data"><span class="a-size-base review-text review-text-content" data-hook="review-body">
<span>At first I was struggling with this pill cutter because I kept trying to roughly chop my pills in half by slamming the blade down. The pill cutter won’t work well if you do that roughly. It works perfectly if you gently tap down on the blade &amp; then I cut the pills in half easily.</span>

<span>Much easier to use than models with little arms supposed to hold pill in place. Had one but found it was a pain to use and cut pills jagged not smooth. Only drawback is that end is not closed so pill pieces can fall out if you are not careful.</span>

<span>I’ve had this pill cutter for over a year and it has been so frustrating. Like other reviews have said, it didn’t cut clean, it would shoot the pill forward, and the extra pressure you had to apply to get it to close would shift the pill and it would cut off center. IT’S THE SELF RETRACTING BLADE GUARD! I didn’t even realize that it was there until I noticed it tonight. I thought, “Oh, there is a plastic piece that was suppose to be removed before use! Why did they make it so hard to remove?” Once I removed it, however, the pill cutter works great! So, I was like, “I need to review this and let other people know!” That’s when I realized the the piece I removed was suppose to be there. Anyhoo…glad I removed it or this product would have gotten 1 star.</span>

<span>I bought this pill cutter to cut 90 pills into fourths. Before I reachef the 20th pill, I had already encountered every problem that people complained about in these reviews.<br/><br/>* The pill cutter stops opening completely, and if you want to open it fully, you have to push the little flexible plastic shield on the bottom up toward the device. However, even if you don't fix it, it doesn't make it any harder to cut pills or less accurate.<br/><br/>* The pill cutter cuts unevenly, but only if you don't position the pill correctly (in orientation, or you don't push it securely into the triangle holder), or you're not using it on a hard flat surface. In other words, this is user error.<br/><br/>* The blade does dull very quickly, but that doesn't affect its effectiveness or accuracy.<br/><br/>* This pill cutter can crush your pills, but only if you're not using it on a hard flat surface.<br/><br/>The only problem that I found that was slightly annoying, was that the cutter left pill dust all over the table underneath it, but it was a minor inconvenience.<br/><br/>In each case, the pill cutter still did its job, and was significantly easier than cutting the pills with a knife.<br/><br/>All you have to do is place it on a hard, flat surface, and make sure that you push the pill into the top of the triangle until it fits snugly. If you care about the pills being even, then make sure that you line it up evenly. And have a wet washcloth or something to clean up the pill dust afterwards.<br/><br/>That's it. It's not perfect, but it's easy, and it works. :)</span>

This pill splitter makes it easy and accurate. Also when I use a knife I often get lots of crumbles, but with this splitter, there is little to no residue. And the built-in catch tray keeps the cut pieces from scattering across the countertop. Definitely a recommended product. Of course, since it isn't expensive, and is made from plastic except for the butter, it is not very rigid, but it does not look like it will fall apart anytime soon.</span>

<span>It is a nice size and biggest percentage of time it cuts pretty well but for a new cutter it often fractures a bit so there are a couple tiny chips. The cutter is easy to handle and when inserted the pill will stay put because of the rubberlike pad it sits on.</span>

<blockquote><em><div class="a-row a-spacing-small review-data"><span class="a-size-base review-text review-text-content" data-hook="review-body">
<span>I was a bit worried ordering this cutter, seeing so many reviews stating they had recieved either the actual Ezy Cut or some random one, so I was pleased to get the right one.<br/>This is one of the best pill cutters I have ever used. Admittedly, there are a couple ways you can  improve your own results. You can't just toss the pill in and expect a perfect cut. My medication, as well as many others, needs exact dosing and we need a reliable cutter to ensure we are getting our proper dosing. Ezy Cut is the answer for me.<br/>First you have to push the little orange anchor shaped part against the pill to make sure it is snugly held in place. I see some reviews stating their pill ends up in the back corners of the cutter. The only time that happened to me was before I realized I needed to push the orange peice against the pill. Since doing that, my pill stays right where it is supposed to.<br/>Close the top just enough that the blade is just resting on top of the pill, then quickly snap snut.<br/>Closing it slowly just caused it to crumble when I tried it that way.<br/>If the pill is scored, when resting the blade on the pill, ensure the blade is perfectly, (and I do mean PERFECTLY,) lined up with the score. If it is not, upon cutting, the pill will cut unevenly and much of it will crumble. When properly lined up, i get a perfect cut.<br/>Again, this is only my experience, I do not wish to, nor am I attempting to, invalidate anyone else's.<br/>So yes, while this pill cutter does need to be used in a precise ways, when used correctly it works very well. The pill pictured was not scored, and as you can see, it was perfectly cut, no crumbles.<br/>My only other complaint is that a slight crack formed a few days ago in the front, and i have not had it long.. I cannot feel the crack on either side, which is odd, but hopefully it doesn't get worse.<br/>I definitely recommend this cutter over the dozens I have tried.<br/>However, the reason I am giving it 4 stars out of 5, is because for those with bad vision, disorders that cause their hands to shake, elderly who may not have assistance with their medication, lining up the pills may be very difficult for them. And really what makes this cutter syand out from others and what gets such optimal results requires secure and proper placement.</span>
