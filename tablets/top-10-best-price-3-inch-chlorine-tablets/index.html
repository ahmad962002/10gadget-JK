<span>1) Purchased the tablets because they keep my pool sparkling clean and free of algae<br/>2) Price per pound was reasonable considering what they provide<br/>3) Bulk packaging IS A BIG DOWNSIDE<br/>  a) The tabs have a tendency to break apart inside the container, leaving powder and pieces which are almost useless.<br/>  b) The bulk packaging is a cost saver for the manufacturer/packager but as these tablets are likely to absorb moisture over time no matter what you do, you will eventually get hit in the face with excessive chlorine vapors from the decomposition<br/>4) Buy a box of sandwich baggies and immediately upon receipt sit in an 'open, airy' environment and transfer each tablet into its own baggie.  Then get three larger baggies and place the individually wrapped tablets into each.  Will they degrade over time....of course they will.....but this 'extra packaging' will do a lot to keep one from getting 'chlorine gassed' upon opening of the larger container.<br/>5) Overall they are still worth buying, but one must be prepared to deal with the 'bulk packaging' aspect.</span>

Pool Mate 3-Inch Chlorine Jumbo Tabs are the strongest chlorine tablets on the market today and they come individually wrapped for safer and easier handling. Each tab is stabilized to protect against harmful UV rays, thus improving the chlorine residual in your pool by guaranteeing a longer-lasting, slower dissolving release. Each tab weighs 8 ounces. Daily instructions: Adjust the chlorine dispensing rate of the floater or in-line feeder to provide 2.0-4.0 ppm of free chlorine residual as determined by a reliable test kit. The initial startup and weekly maintenance dosage is 1 to 3 tablets per 10,000 gallons although this dosage may vary due to unusual conditions such as heavy bather loads, wind, heavy rains, and high temperatures; therefore, frequent use of a reliable test kit is recommended. Use the test kit as a guide to maintain the pH at 7.4-7.6 and total alkalinity at 80-130 ppm. Pool chlorinating tablets are intended for use in a floater or in-line feeder only. Do not add these tablets directly to the pool or mix with any other chemicals. Reentry into treated swimming pools is prohibited above levels of 3 ppm of chlorine. Keep product dry in a tightly closed container when not in use. Store in a cool, dry, well-ventilated area away from heat or open flames. Do not reuse or refill empty container.

<span>None of the tablets were broke.  They last a good 10days in the floater too.  Even with all this Florida rain. 10/10. Would recommend.  I'm glad I paid $12-$15 for this size in the pool stores and Walmart.</span>

<span>I always have had issues with cloudy water and spent the summers using a lot of different chemicals to try to clear it up and maintain clear water. This is the first year I have used this combo and my water has remained clear without having to use any of my other chemicals that I have become used to using. I have used these 2 in conjunction the entire summer so I'm unsure if only using the chlorine tablets would have the same effect, I also keep the pool covered when not in use. The water has remained clear and chlorine levels have remained stable and my stress levels over pool maintenance have greatly diminished.</span>

Robelle 5-In-1 Swimming Pool Multi-Purpose 3" Chlorinating Tabs contain a proprietary blend of ingredients that will reduce the amount of pool chemicals needed to keep your swimming pool clean. Each 3" 8 oz. tab is individually wrapped for easier and safer handling, stabilized to prevent burn-off, and are slow dissolving to maintain a proper free chlorine level. Built-in clarifier produces crystal-clear water. Stain-inhibitor prevents and removes stains caused by metals and minerals. Includes algae preventer that will leave a algaecide residual to help get rid of algae and prevent it from coming back. Built-in descaler will prevent the build up of scale which can cause corrosion. Because your sanitizer has these additional chemicals built in, you will spend less money on pool supplies. For use in feeders or floaters - kills bacteria and controls algae, clarifies, prevents metal staining and corrosion, and reduces scale formation. Important notes: Shock your pool every week and also after heavy rain or heavy use to help keep your pool water properly maintained. Sunlight, rainfall, temperature, number of swimmers and frequency of pool use affect the rate of chlorine residual loss. Adjust cleaning and chemical maintenance accordingly. Use this product in an automatic feeder or floater designed for this product. Do not add other chemicals into the feeder or floater where this product is in use as a fire or explosion may occur. To avoid damage to pool surface or materials do not allow product to come in direct contact with these materials. Do not throw tablets directly into pool. Before using this product ensure all pool equipment is working properly. Adjust stabilizer levels to 40-100 ppm with a Stabilizer. Test the water’s pH, alkalinity, and calcium hardness and adjust to the correct level. Adjust pH to 7.4 - 7.6. Be sure to follow label directions when using other products as outlined in directions for this product. Check the free available chlorine level and adjust to 2-4 ppm by adding a granular chlorinating product. Start up and initial treatment directions: If water is cloudy or green, super-chlorinate pool with appropriate shock product until pool is clear. Add 16 ounces of this product (two tablets) per 10,000 gallons of pool water to feeder or floater and then test for the free available chlorine level (allow water to circulate at least 4 hours before testing). Adjust the feeder or floater following manufacturer’s instructions to establish a free available chlorine level between 2-4 ppm. When free available chlorine level is adjusted to 2-4 ppm, add an algaecide appropriate to your needs. For routine maintenance: Add 16 ounces of this product per 10,000 gallons of pool water per week, or as often as needed, to the feeder or floater to maintain a constant free available chlorine level of 2-4 ppm. Sunlight, rainfall, temperature, number of swimmers and frequency of pool use affect the rate of chlorine residual loss so check the feeder or floater often and refill as needed. Robelle 5-In-1 Swimming Pool Multi-Purpose 3" Chlorinating Tabs will kill bacteria, control algae, clarify water, prevent metal staining and corrosion, and reduce scale formation.
