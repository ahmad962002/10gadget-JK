<span>I have bought three of these Boogie Board Jots because I have found them indispensable for my refrigerator shopping list. Why three? Because inevitably the holder for the stylus will crack and fail and the only workaround is to tie the stylus with string to the bottom of the board. This should be reengineered with stronger plastic that doesn't weather and crack as easily. Note: I do live in a very low humidity environment (Arizona) which seems to shorten the life span of all things plastic or rubber, so it could play some part in the materials failure. And on the positive side, I feel this product is much less messy than dry erase markers and a wipeable board. I like being able to capture the image using the downloadable Jot app on my cell phone. So for those reasons, I keep replacing these when they eventually break. Still a very handy product!</span>

<span>This is a nice little toy with at least some practical value. I bought it thinking I’d put it on the refrigerator somehow and use it to leave last-minute notes to my wife; you know, “Don’t forget milk” and so on. I’m not sure how it works since it takes no batteries and doesn’t need charging, but it works well and is funky/cool/retro in a very good way.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, before I had a chance to play with it, my three-year-old kleptomaniac granddaughter made off with the thing and now it’s at my daughter’s house, three hours away! On the plus side, it only cost ten bucks; cheaper to buy another one than to have my daughter mail mine back to me.<br/><br/>I now know what I’m buying my granddaughter for Christmas. Maybe she can use it to send notes to her cellmates once she’s doing hard time at Shawshank. Considering her light-fingered tendencies, her future incarceration is all but a certainty!</span>

Boogie Board Blackboard NoteBlackboard by Boogie Board is the first-ever writing tool featuring Liquid Crystal Paper, offering a new way to plan, write and design by hand that has more of a natural feel than writing on paper. Unlike other electronic writing solutions offered by more expensive tablets and smart devices, Liquid Crystal Paper writes with absolutely no lag or delay with nothing to turn on, plugin, or charge – making Blackboard ideal for all writing activities like notes, lists, sketches, and more. Perhaps its biggest breakthrough is its 5.5”x 7.25” Note-sized, semi-transparent writing surface that allows writers to electronically write on any document, photo, map, or even digital screen.Exact Erase and Lock FeatureA single touch of its Clear button erases the entire writing surface, but now for the first time ever, Blackboard offers precise control for a pencil-like erasing experience using exact-erase technology. Erase what you want by holding down the Exact-Erase button and using the eraser on the stylus. You can also lock the writing tablet with the Erase-Lock button so you don’t accidentally erase your notes. For work that needs to be saved, download the free Blackboard mobile app "Blackboard by Boogie Board" which allows you to capture, save, organize, search and share.Templates and Protective Folio CoverSeveral templates are included with Blackboard, including lines, grids, planner and a traditional blank template. Ideal for collaborative editing, designing floor plans, tracing, planning, and much more! This bundle also includes a slim sleek protective folio case that will easily fit in a laptop bag or backpack. The perfect accessory to protect and prevent any damage to the writing tablet. To add to your Blackboard writing tablet, simply pull the middle tab out, slide the writing tablet into the two right-side tabs, and then slide the middle tab back into place.

<span>I am just starting out getting into digital painting and drawing (I have almost 40 years of music, video, and photo editing experience by comparison), so for an absolute beginner like me this tablet is probably just right.<br/><br/>The tablet is super simple to use.  Setting it up and loading the driver software was completely painless.  It's probably user error on my part, but getting the 4 buttons to work with the program is a little sketchy (heh) and I've disabled them completely via the settings as a result.<br/><br/>The pen reacts very well onscreen with Affinity Designer, but it does take a lot of getting used to.  I also find that applying pressure to make the lines thicker/darker is not an exact science also and I find it requires more time to adjust the brush settings in the program.  As at least one other reviewer here recommended, I would agree that you should probably get a screen protector for a regular tablet and apply it to this one as it will make the pen movement smoother and not so scratchy.<br/><br/>More expensive tablets are probably more accurate in many ways, but overall it does what I need it to and is a nice alternative to doing everything with a mouse.  If my skills really improve over time, I would definitely get a better pen tablet.</span>

<span>Been using editors for 20 some years with a mouse because I was not sure, I could handle a tablet due to working an editor  &amp; computer with one hand and arm, so glad I got s gift card for a present. I still do everything slower than others, but the job gets done I  love it<br/><br/> So this i my first Wacom got in 2018 got the green one ...love the color very pretty for a tablet  glad I got the small size then the medium size, the small fits good where eve it is used ... I like it because I can use wireless or corded and can still use it while plug in<br/><br/>I try to take care of it and not drop or bang. It has survived 4 years, Covid, and using every time I edit I have had to replace 2- 3 packs ribs in the pen 4 years but use it allot for and.  And the tablet is scratched but still working, and I have the original pen bedsides replacing the ribs in the pen.<br/><br/>It works better and does not lag if you keep and Windows it updated with all the new updates  &amp; drivers though<br/><br/> I use it most on a board across my lap with a keyboard. And mouse I only use it for all 3 editors for Photoshop and Photoshop Elements &amp; Corel Paint Shop Pro, and it works well with all 3  editors<br/><br/>I prefer the mouse in the other programs and internet and the tablets to edit.<br/><br/>. I program the tablet and pen with the shortcuts I have the hardest doing the editors now I just click, instead of fighting my hand &amp;  keyboard I love it with the paint brush tool and while I photo repair I do photo repair for people It does help me with the editors allot<br/><br/>Only had trouble with it once when I was setting up by the Customer Service was nice, and sent me a replacement I forget and forgetting to plug in (that my fault). I am so glad I went to this model instead of the other I think since I am a small person the others would be too big I just wished it would have  more room on the tablet for more commands for disabled person<br/><br/>I am planning to replace this tablet with the same one when this one goes dead</span>

<span>I initially purchased the wired Intuos Small drawing tablet and it simply worked. This was my first drawing tablet. I then ordered the Bluetooth version for use with my laptop knowing several reviews said it was laggy. And sure enough, the Bluetooth version was super laggy. I almost returned it.<br/><br/>After a bit of research, I came across a mention of interference from other Bluetooth devices. Since the only other Bluetooth device I was using was a Bluetooth trackball, I turned it off and sure enough the lag disappeared. My trackball came with a USB receiver, so I was able to use both the trackball and the Intuos drawing tablet without lag.<br/><br/>Conclusion: If you have many Bluetooth devices hooked up to your device, don't get the Bluetooth Intuos drawing tablet as it will be laggy. Otherwise, it works just a well as the wired version.</span>

<span>I LOVE this! It fits on my lap and I'm able to draw with my right hand while keeping the left on my keyboard, which eliminates the need for extra buttons on the tablet itself. I've had much bigger drawing monitors with fancy controls, but this is more comfortable and natural to draw with, and I find myself reaching for it while editing far more often than I ever did with the big monitors. The drawing surface feels great. No lag, no distance between the pen and the surface.</span>

<span>This pen display is really good for its price, the main features are there and you can't deny that they work perfectly well. Here are the things that are kind of missing or that I would want: touch screen for zooming etc, wireless capabilities, maybe an extra button or two, and the adjustment of the height level is super basic so be prepared to use random books if your desk isnt the right height or angle. Really solid tablet, simple to use and connect.</span>

<span>Love the size and form factor. Love that I can take it with me in my laptop bag. Wish it was usb-c but I imagine that will be an option in the future as the technology improves.</span>

<span>Installed and loaded quickly.  The screen resolution is good.  Not quite what the higher-end Wacom tablets are, but good enough for me to be successful with fine detail and shading of some pretty involved images.  I'm more than pleased!<br/><br/>If someone you love has a passion for traditional or digital art, I highly recommend you purchase this for them.  Consider it an investment in their future.</span>
