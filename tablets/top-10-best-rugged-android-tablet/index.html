<div class="slideshow-container">
<blockquote><em><div class="a-row a-spacing-small review-data"><span class="a-size-base review-text review-text-content" data-hook="review-body">
<span>Bought this for my destructive preschooler. So far it’s been really good. It’s rugged enough to go through all of his drops and spills a vent made a dent in it thus far. It is fast enough to keep up with his short attention span too, seamlessly switching between apps and running games like a dream. I cant say much about the use of the pen as we haven’t given it to him (didn’t want to lose it). But I can say so far this is a rugged reliable tablet that can stand up to everything my kid can throw at it.</span>

<blockquote><em><div class="a-row a-spacing-small review-data"><span class="a-size-base review-text review-text-content" data-hook="review-body">
<span>Being a Samsung fan, I was delighted to upgrade to this tablet. Battery life is great, but the audio is something I'll mention as well. So much better than my old tablet. The tablet is wifi/data and I use the data on it alot. Refresh rate is great. The tablet came much quicker than expected. Very happy overall.</span>

<blockquote><em><div class="a-row a-spacing-small review-data"><span class="a-size-base review-text review-text-content" data-hook="review-body">
<span>It's a very nice tablet, but not quite what I was looking for.<br/><br/>I was hoping to find a sunlight-readable tablet that was effective outdoors in the direct sunshine.  Unfortunately, the screen of this tablet acts like a mirror, reflecting the background, washing out what's showing on the screen.  It works great in the shade, but not in direct sunlight.  Perhaps what I was looking for is impossible.<br/><br/>It's definitely rugged, and appears to be seriously water-resistant (although I haven't tested that).  It has a huge battery, which gives it excellent battery life.  I was a bit surprised at how heavy it is, but that's reasonable considering the ruggedness, and the power required for long battery life with a very bright screen.</span>

In fact, at this point I really kind of hate it due to one factor: the terrible placement of the function buttons.<br/><br/>To be fair, the tablet it's perfect in almost every respect, but the placement of the function buttons is terrible and frustrating.<br/><br/>When held in landscape mode (which is the only way I use it) the function buttons are located on the bottom bezel.<br/><br/>This means that if you want to click the Home or Back buttons you have to lift it up to press them. The older Galaxy TAB devices have the buttons on the right which is perfect, because that's where your thumb naturally ends up.<br/><br/>The buttons are also marked so faintly that even under bright light it's nearly impossible to see the markings. Not a deal-breaker, but it shows a real lack of thought in terms of end-user design.<br/><br/>To add insult to injury, the smaller 8" version of this tablet DOES have the buttons located correctly (on the right of the bezel in landscape orientation), but an 8" screen is too small for watching movies, browsing the web, and reading ebooks. That extra inch of screen size makes a big difference; you wouldn't think it would but it does, at least for me.<br/><br/>Again, this is a *great* tablet in almost every way, but the ridiculous/terrible design choice to place the function buttons on the bottom is an absolute no-go for me. I'll either return it or sell it online.<br/><br/>You were SO close, Samsung, so so close. So disappointing. I guess I'll be using my old TAB A for the foreseeable future.</span>

<span>I ordered this tablet as an alternative to using my iPad 12.9” when flying my drone. I love using the iPad but the screen dimming is very annoying as I’m sure a lot of folks can attest to as well. This tablet suffers from none of these issues and performs well with my DJI Mini 2. The brightness is out of this world. I haven’t tried flying with the DJI smart controller that is also not supposed to fade in the direct sunlight, but this option has a bigger screen and is capable of working with multiple drone brands. It was also compatible with my Lifthor Baldur tablet holder that I already purchased to use with my iPad. So that was an unintended added bonus. The ability to use this tablet with multiple drone brands over say the DJI smart controller, the ruggedness, and full functionality of having a device that can be used as a phone or tablet was worth the investment. Update to this review a few months later.  I stand by my assessment, this is a great tablet. I did have an issue with AT&amp;T as I initially activated as a tablet and was not aware I was not getting the full potential as I had been flying within range of my Wi-Fi network. I was when notified by the carrier about their discontinuation of support for 3G devices that I became aware of an issue. After struggling with AT&amp;T and a little work with Tripltek support I dropped the tablet line and activated a new phone line. I can’t tell what the difference is for AT&amp;T but a tablet line doesn’t appear to work. Activate this device as a smart phone and it will perform as it is advertised. The issues I experienced were due to me wanting to save the extra cost of a tablet line as opposed to a phone line. There is apparently a difference. Don’t let your AT&amp;T person tell you differently. Two different SIM cards for the tablet line, same results, two SIM cards for cell phones that both worked flawlessly speaks volumes.</span>

<span>I purchased the DJI RC PRO and it literarily became a $1200 paperweight, seriously!  Luckily, DJI excepted the return and it's on the way back as I write this review.<br/><br/>Tripltek......is exactly what you need if you're serious about using your Drone, at the Job Site, Emergency Management, Crisis Management, Police, Government, or in your warehouse.  Tripltek is durable and has the protection like no other.  You can add a SIM card for easy uploads, streaming, or just receiving/making a call.  I wish I would have known about this sooner, truly.</span>

<span>I am a drone pilot and fly several drones that require different types of software to operate.  This tablet handled the installs and operate of the different software totally without issues or problems.<br/><br/>I live in Florida and the sunshine is over the top.  The tablet's brightness is incredible, but the Florida Sun still offers some challenges.  While the interface to control the drone is still very clear in the sunshine, the video being displayed is still a little challenged.  Despite this challenge, this device is the brightest I have every worked with or seen on other devices.<br/><br/>I have had the device out many times in the super Florida heat and humidity and the device has never had a hiccup or a failure.<br/><br/>The battery life is super!  On at least 2 outings I failed to unplug the device from the controller and despite the tablet charging my controller because of my unplug error, the table always seemed to have at least a 50% charge on it and this allowed me to go and fly and not loose my day.<br/><br/>Yes, the tablet is heavy, but to me I feel like it is truly a Professional Tool.  The super sized battery and the fact that it appears to have been built into an industrial case makes the weight expectable and worth it.<br/><br/>The tablet does not mount well, at first look, to my DJI Phantom 4 Pro V2 or my DJI Mini 2.  I had previously used a 10" tablet and added an extension to the controller arm to hold the tablet.  What I found was that the standard phone/tablet mount on the controller unit was perfect.  The top and bottom holders did not extent out far enough to reach completely over or around the thickness of the tablet and lock it in, but the heavy duty elastic hand strap on the tablet could be unlocked and place both sides of the elastic strap around the outside the support bracket on the controller and lock the strap close and the tablet gets locked in perfectly and securely.  My Mini 2 had a 3rd party tablet extension on it for the previous tablet.  I used this 3rd party extension the same way as for my P4P and again it was a solid and secure attachment.  The extension could be a little heaver to support the tablet, but I am not tossing it around and while flying I have no problems balancing the components.  When carrying the combined controller &amp; tablet, I carry everything by holding the tablet.<br/><br/>Yes this tablet is a little pricey, but I feel I have made a wise and strong investment in a tablet that will have many years of use and built to survive out in the wild when I fly.<br/><br/>Regards,<br/>Chuck B.</span>

<span>Ordered the product on a Sunday and notification said it would be delivered Thursday. Cool. On Monday I got a weird notification from Amazon that my product was "undeliverable" and was being sent back to the seller. Weird, so I reached out to Tripletek to ask them what's up. They responded within an hour and said not to worry about it, just an Amazon glitch and my tablet is on the way. Shockingly, it was delivered the next day, 2 days early! After receiving it, I only had 2 issues. Needed to know what kind of stylus I should use with it, and how to make apps go into "tablet mode" (by default, apps think they are on a phone). Again, within hours Tripletek responded with answers to both questions (it will go to tablet mode, instructions are on their website). The tablet itself is fantastic, incredibly bright screen outdoors, plenty of memory, snappy response, built like a tank and worked perfectly with the T-Mobile SIM I dropped in.  Between the product quality and features, along with the customer service, you can't ask for more. Buy with absolute confidence.</span>

<span>I know all the cool kids want thin bezels and no headphone jacks, but... I want to be able to hold my tablet securely without accidentally "clicking" things.  This tablet combines an at least superficially "rugged" appearance with decent CPU and graphics performance, good battery life, a good screen, and decent touch performance (which I find degrades as display size increases -- just anecdotal, but hey...)  This is not a "computing workhorse", but it's OK.<br/><br/>Positives:<br/> * Dust covers for all ports.

Seems like overkill, but it charges quickly.<br/> * Face buttons at bottom of screen (in portrait orientation)<br/> * Back of chassis appears to be removable (screws!) for potential repair/battery replacement<br/> * Shallow "feet" and D-rings on back for attachment of a lanyard, or the supplied palm strap<br/><br/>A couple downsides -<br/> * speaker placement and sound quality: The placement of the speaker on the back results in the speaker being significantly muted when the tablet is put down flat on a surface.  The frequency response of the speaker seems to have a pinched high around 2kHz ... maybe a little higher... i haven't done any measurements... but  it's a little fatiguing to listen to for extended periods (to my ear, at least).<br/> * The location of the power button relative to the volume buttons is a little troublesome -- could be further apart.<br/> * The cameras are a bit crap.  ...a bit.  They're not BAD.  I didn't buy this thing to take HDR art photos, but... just keep your expectations reasonable.</span>

<span>I think it's a great rugged 8 inch tablet that  met all my expectations. Well for some reason Samsung didn't enable voice over LTE, voice over IP works fine. I use Google voice which is free and I can make and receive calls on this tablet! You can use internet connection sharing and connect other devices to share your LTE internet, but speeds are limited. However the tablet has DeX which lets you run Android on your laptop or TV wirelessly in an environment very similar to Windows 10! Your internet speeds are not limited when using Dex so you can watch videos at full 1080p. The only problem I have is all the software that Samsung ads to the tablet which is trying to duplicate everything that's already on it from Google. it has room for two SIM cards (if you don't mind giving up the memory card slot) and if you have one sim for LTE and the other one set up for 3g, theoretically you should be able to make phone calls over the 3G sim and get your internet over the LTE sim. I haven't tried this yet I've only had this for a few days but so far I'm very impressed with it!</span>

<span>This could be a game changer.<br/>Recent updates to my drone’s control software finally required more compute power than my iPad Mini 4 could muster. I also really wanted a brighter screen.<br/>Today I flew my drone using my new Tripltek Pro tablet. Under the midday August sun, the Tripltek utterly blew me away.<br/>See, I’m accustomed to peering under a hood, and squinting to make out the screen of my iPad Mini 4. This causes two issues.<br/>First, it affects my flying. I have to add considerable extra “cushion” around poorly-seen obstacles (including, notably, the ground), so I miss opportunities. Second, it’s easy to make silly mistakes when you’re framing up photos and video segments on a dim screen.<br/>——— Paradise! ———<br/>The Tripltek tablet makes all that history. Turns out my flying skills are way better than I thought! That dim screen made me unsure of what the drone was doing, and so therefore unsteady at the helm. Now that I can see, I have much finer control. I anticipate much better results in the future. And it’ll be a while before this beast is obsolete!<br/>——— Trouble in Paradise? ———<br/>The video feed on this first flight was smooth and flawless, even when the control app stopped functioning. What?!? Yeah that happened to me a couple of times. Nothing on the app screen was updating (e.g. telemetry, artificial horizon, you-name-it), although the video feed was immaculate and I could observe that the drone was fully responsive to the controls. I force killed the app and restarted it; that fixed the problem. I never saw this particular misbehavior with the same app on the iPad Mini 4 (I saw other misbehaviors), but it’s hard to know where to place the blame. I have noticed some minor Androidy glitchiness that I don’t see on my Samsung phone, so I will be watching for stability issues. As long as my video isn’t laggy, it’s not a big issue.<br/>——— Complications in Paradise ———<br/>That bright screen gulps power, and the Tripltek has a massive battery to provide it. And ”mass” is definitely a thing here. This smallish tablet is hheeaavvyy. And it’s about as thick as a really good pizza. You will definitely need a special bracket to mount it to a drone controller. The one Tripltek offers for my situation isn’t that great, but it’s better than nothing! I got a better job 3D-printed bracket from a friend, but there are some other options, from reasonable to spendy.</span>

<span>Hi, the Tripltex Pro tablet with a 1200 nits brightness is pretty good, but still suffers a little in full bright sunlight for drone flying. 2000 nits would be better. It can be fitted with a sun-shield that minimizes the brightness issue. The tablet is rugged, but heavy. Android 9 supports all the DJI and Autel drone apps. It's an impressive piece of hardware and is a lower cost alternative to buying Smart Controllers. So far, it is the best tablet I have experienced for drone flying use.</span>

The metal clamping unit is cumbersome, heavy and doesn’t hold the tablet securely.  I also found the usb-c to usb-c cord they sell doesn’t fit the usb-c plug on the tablet and I had to buy another one from amazon.<br/><br/>Android is a new experience for me but has not been an issue.<br/><br/>Battery life seems a bit less than I’d expected but outlasts my drone batteries and my endurance.<br/><br/>I’d say it’s better than the DJI extra cost controller as it could be used for other things besides the drone.</span>

<span>For context, I purchased this tablet on sale for $109.00. Additionally, I have been using Samsung Galaxy S series phones for a decade, previously used a Samsung tablet from about 2013-2015, and currently use both a Fire HD 8 (2020 model) tablet and a Fire 7 (2019 model) tablet. Finally, I purchased this because I needed a tablet with access to Google Play Services for a specific set of purposes.<br/><br/>First of all, it's important to keep in mind that the Galaxy A series is Samsung's "budget" line of tablets and smartphones, and this is the cheapest of their tablets. The performance is not going to be as good as the flagship Series S or Series Z devices; if you have, for example, an S22 as your phone, you should not expect the performance of this tablet, the screen, etc to match that. It also is not going to meet the specs and quality of iPads, Surfaces, or other high-end tablets. That being said, Android tablets overall are much better quality than they were several years ago, which my experience with this tablet has confirmed for me.<br/><br/>The screen is good--much better than I expected. Everything is clear and sharp, and there's basically no pixilation. It does have a lower pixel density than a lot of other devices, but more than most budget Android tablets. The screen can also be slightly difficult to view from certain angles, although that shouldn't be an issue for 99% of use cases; it can also be a bit difficult to see in brighter lights. In terms of physical qualities, it's basically the same as the screen on my S21.<br/><br/>The sound is also better than I expected. It doesn't seem to carry as far as other devices--once again, not a huge issue--but it's loud and clear. The fact that there's an audio jack is appreciated, and one can always connect a speaker or headphones via bluetooth.<br/><br/>The extra 1GB of RAM compared to my Fire HD 8 is definitely noticeable in most cases, although this is still not what I would call a speedy device. If you're just watching video, listening to audio, and reading, this will be irrelevant to you outside of saving a second or so when you open an app, pull up the keyboard, or turn on the tablet. I have not played any games on it, but I assume that more demanding ones would have some noticeable difficulties on this.<br/><br/>Battery life seems great so far. The tablet supports fast charging, but the included charger does not.<br/><br/>The tablet is lightweight, although compared to my Fire HD 8, it is not as comfortable to hold. The materials used are also very nice, and it doesn't look or feel like a budget tablet. It's small enough that fitting it into most bags or purses shouldn't be difficult. The fact that storage is also expandable up to 1 TB is appreciated. The charging port is USB-C, which is basically standard nowadays, although many budget devices still use micro-USB, so it's worth mentioning.<br/><br/>The cameras are adequate, and are fine for Zoom, Skype, and other video sites. I have not used the microphone, but I assume it's also serviceable.<br/><br/>There are seemingly some interesting options to connect this to a Samsung phone, although I am not using those. Still, this could be a nice option for some people.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, there do not seem to be very many good cases available for this model. There do appear to be a lot of "heavy-duty" cases for it though, which is nice if you're purchasing this for a young child.<br/><br/>Overall, if you can get this on sale--especially if you *have* to have access to Google Play Services or otherwise can't or don't want to use Fire OS--this is definitely a great choice for a tablet. It will get updates and remain usable for far longer than similarly-priced and cheaper Android tablets from Onn, Chinese manufacturers using the names of old American brands, and the like. That being said, if you're primarily looking for a device for consuming content--which is what the overwhelming majority of people use tablets for--I'd still recommend the Fire HD 8, especially during one of the many times per year that it goes on sale, as I don't feel that the differences are worth the extra $50.00-$110.00 the A7 Lite will cost. Still, this is probably the best inexpensive Android tablet on the market today, and is a fantastic option to consider if you're looking to purchase one.</span>

<span>To be clear, I mainly use this tablet for recreational purposes (X-BOX gaming, Marvel comics reading and MLB watching). Nothing crazy. With that being said, it's definitely a steal of a product. Last tablet I knew that went for around 100 bucks was a bad joke! This one is a quality tablet for the tag though. Good picture quality. Speaker placed on the top and bottom so when in landscape mode, you get that surround sound feeling/effect. Don't get carried away though. They're still just tablet speakers. Lol. My only quarrel is that it has a tendency to lag upon certain actions like switching apps or pulling up the keyboard or typing the first 2 characters. There seems to be a slight delay. I would say about a ½ to ¾ of a second. Battery seems decent. Haven't really been able to dive into it as far as charging time and battery length. But it does hold a charge something serious though. I've been watching live baseball games all day and I only needed the charger twice for the day. All in all, not a perfect tablet but for the price, if you're in need of one, it would behoove you to pick this one up while you still can. ✌🏾<br/><br/>Update:<br/>Battery life is VERY good but charging takes some time.</span>

<span>Amazing I didn't realize how slow my old tablet was until I  set this one up and started using it wow.  All my data transferred flawlessly along with my apps.  When I Want to use any of my office files they're at my fingertips No problem. I love this tablet so much I just purchased the phone to go with it so I'm giving up my fairly new phone for the Samsung.</span>

<span>Needed a secondary system and this fills the void.  Bought it for my wife and she loves that it's very user friendly.  She's not technically savy so it works for her.</span>

<span>I had previously gotten a cheap tablet, it had several "small issues" at first (randomly restarted almost daily, battery life was poor despite the indicator saying otherwise, games would randomly crash). After two years, it became almost unusable. It would shut off after about 15 minutes if not connected to power (despite battery indicator saying 90 percent). After this experience, I decided to not be cheap and spend more money on a good tablet. I found this model and I have seen almost no issues since I bought it back in March. Battery life is excellent. Have not seen any random restarts.  The games that would frequently crash on the old device are now working flawlessly.  I did get a warranty just in case this device would fail. However so far so good. It has been worth the extra money that I spent on it.</span>

<span>I am not an Android guy. Although I am always fascinated by Android devices and products. I have owned quite a few Chinese knock-offs and a few Xiaomi brand phones but nothing ever lasted. In retrospect, I didn’t give them much of a chance. I am an Apple guy. I love Mac and Apple products. What I don’t like? The price. What I do like? The quality. Apple has maintained quality products for some time. I’ve had many iPhones, iPads, Mac Pros, Macbook Pros, Macbooks, Mac minis, and iMacs. Our whole office here in Ghana is on mac. Why? Reliability and longevity. Ok, so I’ve got the fanboying out the way, on to the subject of this post.<br/><br/>Why did you buy this thing?<br/>Well, simply put, on one of my trips back to the US earlier this year, my 13″ Macbook Pro died and I needed a replacement. I loved the 13″ size for going back and forth to the office and it was a good “beater” laptop. I have a loaded 16″ Macbook Pro that I prefer to keep in pristine shape for editing video and graphics. I figured let’s try the 12.4″ tablet and see if it can handle what I am throwing at it.<br/><br/>I LOVE THIS TABLET.<br/><br/>I am typing on it right now for this post. I was skeptical of having an Android tablet after having a few knock-offs and bad experiences with them, but this thing just keeps getting better. The only downside? No iMessaging or integration of Mac apps. I can live without that. In fact, it has me wondering if I should switch all of my note-taking, list-making, and stuff to Google apps.<br/><br/>Speed<br/>This thing is fast. I’m not just talking fast, I’m talking lighting fast. I am constantly shocked at how responsive and quick everything is. Websites load fast, apps load without hesitation, and streaming is a joy. With the Qualcomm SM7225 Octa-Core processor, this thing delivers. My kids use iPad devices for streaming and sometimes school. My son has one of the later models of the regular iPad. This Samsung tab smokes it. I mean trail of fire smokes it.<br/><br/>Screen<br/>The screen on this device is one of the best I’ve ever seen or used. I’m serious. I like it better than the iPads I own. It’s clear, and crisp and the 4K video looks incredible on it. Let’s put it this way, I’d rather watch Netflix on this tablet than on my 16″ Macbook Pro. Even when viewing bad or old footage on YouTube, I’ve found the quality is amazing. I’m not sure what they’re doing over there at Samsung but they better keep doing it. If you don’t believe me, go find one on display at a store. You’ll be a believer quickly. Even with fingerprints of my own and my kids, this thing is still crisp and clear. For what it’s worth, I do not put on-screen protectors on my devices. I don’t like the loss of clarity and function with screen protectors.<br/><br/>Battery Life<br/>I have yet to have this thing die on me. Granted I don’t use it enough to kill the battery. Even after two days of not being on the charger, it was still at 60%. I couldn’t believe it. Time will tell how long that lasts but if it’s this good to start with I don’t feel worried about that at all. Maybe when I fly again back to the States I’ll test how long it lasts on a flight.<br/><br/>Accessories<br/>With this tablet, I bought the Amazon suggested keyboard and case made by Fintie. For all intents and purposes, it’s not a bad case. Do I wish I had bought the Samsung keyboard and case? Sure. But the cost was a bit high and I didn’t think it was a deal-breaker on the tablet. The Fintie case works well enough and offers a few options for pen storage. I do like that the tablet came with a tablet pen which is a good selling point, even if you don’t use it.<br/><br/>Conclusion<br/>All in all, this tablet is a winner. The screen alone is worth the price but as an added bonus the speed just feels unmatched. If I had to go back and choose again, I’d likely choose it again. If you’re an Apple person, like I am, this is a worthy device to add to your arsenal.</span>
