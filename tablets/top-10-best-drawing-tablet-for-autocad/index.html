One by Wacom drawing tablet is designed to make learning easier. Use the digital pen and tablet with your computer to draw, edit photos, express ideas, write formulas and interact in online classes in a way you can’t with a keyboard and trackpad. The simple USB connection to a Chromebook, Mac or Windows computer couldn’t be easier (some devices require a USB-C adapter) and the battery-free pressure-sensitive pen doesn’t require charging so it works the moment it touches the tablet surface. With Wacom’s 35+ years of digital pen development, you can count on One by Wacom as a high-quality, reliable product to last well beyond your school years. This product works with devices capable of running the latest version of Chrome OS and has been certified to meet Google's compatibility standards. Google is not responsible for the operation of this product or its compliance with safety requirements. Chromebook and the Works With Chromebook badge are trademarks of Google LLC. Pen must be used in conjunction with the tablet to function with Chrome OS.

<div class="slideshow-container">
<blockquote><em><div class="a-row a-spacing-small review-data"><span class="a-size-base review-text review-text-content" data-hook="review-body">
<span>It worked like crap and I was confused but then I downloaded the driver's from the Wacom website and it was perfect.</span>
</span></div></em></blockquote>
<p> </p>
<blockquote><em><div class="a-row a-spacing-small review-data"><span class="a-size-base review-text review-text-content" data-hook="review-body">
<span>I mainly used this for osu! but I also tested some drawing applications aswell. Works well for both uses and is very easily customizable with both buttons and the tip itself being able to be mapped to a different input. Overall good for the price just wish the material was a bit sturdier.</span>
</span></div></em></blockquote>
<p> </p>
<blockquote><em><div class="a-row a-spacing-small review-data"><span class="a-size-base review-text review-text-content" data-hook="review-body">
<span>I absolutely love this tablet; I bought it so that I could take notes for my precalculus class on my computer, so I wouldn't have to waste paper.<br/>The only thing I would say is a little irritating is how the stylus sounds when I'm using the tablet, but it's nothing that some headphones can't fix.<br/>I'm very happy with it so far!</span>
</span></div></em></blockquote>
<p> </p>
<blockquote><em><div class="a-row a-spacing-small review-data"><span class="a-size-base review-text review-text-content" data-hook="review-body">
<span>Recommended by many, this tablet is amazing for osu!. The pen has some grip and can be held comfortably. The tablet has some extra friction which can help you aim with less shaking. Because of the lack of hardware smoothing, you may need to download tablet drivers and add an antichatter plugin (inside the drivers). This doesn't mean that it's bad, on the contrary, this is actually a good thing! Less hardware smoothing means you have more control over your aim and you won't have to worry about the software messing up your aim. Overall, I recommend this tablet 10/10.</span>

<span>I'm pretty new to digital art so when I heard these drawing tablets without display "take some getting used to" I instead bought one of those expensive drawing tablets with a display, but it's so huge I have to rearrange my whole desk every time I want to use it so I rarely do.<br/>So, I bought this tiny tablet on a whim because it would fit perfectly on my desk, AND IT TOOK ME ONLY AROUND 5 MINUTES TO GET USED TO DRAWING WITHOUT LOOKING DOWN, IT'S RIDICULOUSLY COMFORTABLE TO USE. ESPECIALLY BECAUSE OF THE BLUETOOTH. I expected a bit of lag, but there was none for me. I prefer it so much over my other tablet that is 10x the price.... I was so stupid!</span>

<span>I bought this product to have something to draw from off of my laptop. For the price and the 3 softwares that were included, this product was more than worth it. The set-up process was very easy. You can set-up the touch screen to be as sensitive or as non-sensitive as you'd like. I've had no problems with the product or my laptop thus far when I use it. I really like that you can customize the 4 buttons at the top to perform whatever functions you'd like such as undo or redo. Altogether, the buttons act as a holder for the pen as well, which I think is a nice addition. I highly recommend this product for beginners, however, it can take some time to get used to since you're just drawing on a tablet and not an actual screen. It took me a while to get the hang of not having to look down every time I draw with it, but other than that, for the price and for the 3 free softwares that are included, this is a great product for beginners.</span>

<span>I am brand new to the drawing/sculpting scene and this was a great way to introduce myself to the basics. Very easy to set up after you make your account and verify everything. I am a big fan of the Bluetooth capabilities and the fact that I don't have to have any wires connected; I can sit back in my chair and relax while I use the tablet. I do wish there was a slot somewhere for the pen or an elastic to hold onto it but that's not enough of a deterrent to not recommend the product. Very happy with this purchase and would highly recommend to any beginners looking to get into this hobby.</span>

<span>I initially purchased the wired Intuos Small drawing tablet and it simply worked. This was my first drawing tablet. I then ordered the Bluetooth version for use with my laptop knowing several reviews said it was laggy. And sure enough, the Bluetooth version was super laggy. I almost returned it.<br/><br/>After a bit of research, I came across a mention of interference from other Bluetooth devices. Since the only other Bluetooth device I was using was a Bluetooth trackball, I turned it off and sure enough the lag disappeared. My trackball came with a USB receiver, so I was able to use both the trackball and the Intuos drawing tablet without lag.<br/><br/>Conclusion: If you have many Bluetooth devices hooked up to your device, don't get the Bluetooth Intuos drawing tablet as it will be laggy. Otherwise, it works just a well as the wired version.</span>

<blockquote><em><div class="a-row a-spacing-small review-data"><span class="a-size-base review-text review-text-content" data-hook="review-body">
<span>My background: I'm a traditional and digital artist and graphic designer with ten years' worth of off and on experience with traditional Wacom tablets, most recently the Intuos 3 Pro.<br/><br/>Pros: This thing works exactly the way I wanted it to. My struggle before was the hand/eye coordination involved with drawing on one thing and looking at another. The Cintiq closed that gap the way I was hoping! Once you calibrate the pen, you won't notice the parallax. There's the tiniest delay between pen input and output, but after you get used to it, it's just not an issue. The pen works great and the pressure sensitivity is exceptional — no weird glitches or blobs the way my old tablet would sometimes do. The built in stand is super sturdy and useful. And I'm finding that the 16 screen width is actually plenty of space for the kind of hobby art I want to create — and the trade off for the slimmer profile of the smaller size is actually preferable to me. It's also relatively plug and play: just download the driver from the website like the booklet says. No issues getting it all to work on a Mac, so they must have fixed that connection problem some other reviewers mentioned.<br/><br/>The cons: There's no gesture support, and it would be nice to just have pinch to zoom at my disposal, but I knew going into this what I was buying and I can live without that for the price point. I have only two real complaints. The first is that the color accuracy is actually noticable when you check against a MacBook Pro screen. I guess this can be managed by having your monitor close by, but it can be a bit of a pain to keep checking when you're doing digital paintings. But it's not the end of the world for my particular use. The second issue I have is with the cords. The power cord is three pieces long if you include the three-in-one, and it's obnoxiously inflexible. And if you want to use this with something like a MacBook Pro that only has USB-C, you may need to get a couple of adapters for the Cintiq and your external monitor in order to accommodate two HDMI cables. I was fortunate to have one on hand, as well as a USB to USB-C, or I wouldn't have even been able to test this out upon receipt of the product.<br/><br/>Bottom line: if you're a budget-conscious artist and you want to make the leap from traditional to screen tablets, you can't go wrong with this one.</span>

<span>I was deciding whether or not to dive into the world of iPad based on the portability and recommendations for Procreate, but since I have zero other Apple products and planned to use it for only art and learning digital, I decided to go for the Cintiq 16 even though that would mean limited portability. I'll just have to take my laptop with me if I travel with it. I've tried other Tablets before - I have a Huion 1060 and an old Wacom Bamboo tablet, but coming from traditional media, I had a difficult time adjusting to not viewing my work right under my hand. I'm actually excited and enjoying jumping back into learning digital art now that I can focus on the screen that I'm drawing on!<br/><br/>I experienced the "No Signal" issue at first and was immediately freaked out, but it turns out I was so excited that I didn't pay attention when I plugged the HDMI cable into my motherboard instead of my GPU (lol). Just a little bit of fiddling with my monitor setup and I had software running after a few mins on its own screen.<br/><br/>I was able to register the device with Wacom and got the free trial for Clip Studio Paint, which is AMAZING. I am so overwhelmed with the capabilities - I was used to playing around in Autodesk Sketchbook, so it was a bit of shock and it's going to take some time to learn the ins-and-outs.<br/><br/>Absolutely loving it so far!!</span>

<span>This tablet has exceeded my expectations! The sensitivity settings and realism for that pen to paper feel is just outstanding! Pressure sensitivity to lighten up or bleed out the ink or what ever brush type you are using is just fantastic!<br/><br/>I have had many Wacom products over the years but they have really honed in on the artist needs like I’ve never seen before. I highly recommend this for beginners or advanced users!<br/><br/>It will keep you engaged and excited with your art work. Best of luck to all and a special thank you to Wacom for there continued passion to make tools for the digital artist!</span>

<span> I am an illustrator and animator (@inkshift) with over 14 years of experience working for Disney &amp; Cartoon Network here in Portland, OR. I've also been a Wacom user for over 20 years, so let me open this review by saying they really knocked it out of the park with this new Cintiq 22.<br/><br/>This is also my 4th Cintiq, so you judge for yourself if i have a problem or not ;) I have the 27” pro at my office as well as the new 16 and a super old 12” in addition to a handful of tablets dating all the way back to the late 90s.<br/><br/>This Cintiq 22 is part of their new line of more affordable Cintiqs Wacom started rolling out this year and it really seems to be the golden mean between the smaller 16 and the larger Pros. Full disclosure: Wacom DID provide me this unit for review purposes but I hereby solemnly swear all views in this review are entirely my own and 100% my own opinions.<br/><br/>First off: the pressure sensitivity is beautiful and virtually indistinguishable from my 27” pro, which cost over twice as much.  As you can see in the attached timelapse of an illustration I did on this 22, each line came out exactly like I wanted it: smooth tapers, no shaky lines, no blotches, weird unintended textures or weird ends to my strokes.<br/>The included Pro Pen 2 is a solid, comfortable pen and really helps you feel the 8192 levels of pressure. You can also the new Pro Pen slim if you want a sleeker pen but i prefer the stubbier feel.<br/><br/>Secondly, the overall build quality and polish impresses, it is very solid and the design is professional and clean. Small detail but important to me: the power button is easily pushed and feels pleasant and responsive.<br/>The entire machine feels very sturdy while not being too heavy. I kind of wish they brought back the side buttons they had on the 12” and 21” but I can see how it makes sense ergonomically and aesthestically to leave those off.  It should be noted that this 22” doesn’t come with a remote or a bluetooth keyboard, which is not a deal breaker for me because my 27” came with the remote and I never use it.<br/><br/>It DOES however come with a fantastic, preattached stand!  The new stand is sturdy, stable, lightweight, solid metal with non-slip rubber grippy feet, easy to use and highly flexible. Wacom REALLY came through for its users with the stand this time, as I have not been a fan of the stands of the past: they’re either huge, expensive, cumbersome and awkward to operate or they just have the little fold out legs, which are simply insufficient for long term use and you’d need to invest in an extendable arm that can keep your Cintiq suspended/supported.<br/><br/>One difference between the pro line and this newer, more affordable line is that these units do not have a bonded glass display. THis means that there’s a tiny bit of space between the pen and the screen and that generally means there is more parallax (the offset between the cursor and the pen), but it was not noticeable to me once I calibrated it properly. The screen has an anti-glare surface which feels nice and smooth, not slick or slippery at all with just the right amount of texture to it.<br/><br/>Another difference between this 22 and the pro line is the Adobe RGB colour range. This Cintiq sports a 72% Adobe RGB vs a 97% for the pro line, but I don’t think you will be disappointed (or honestly really notice? I didn’t) unless you’re super tuned into colour and colour correction or need the most accurate representation possible. But at that point, you should probably be investing in the pro line.<br/><br/>Like I said, I also have the new 16 which is also great but felt a bit small to me and became cumbersome very quickly for when I needed a number of palettes/windows open. At 22”, (21.5” viewable), that is is not a problem here at all.<br/><br/>Wacom has paid great attention to detail in packaging as well as the attached power cords: it includes a British power plug free of charge, as well as 2 different orientations of power cords: horizontal and vertical. As you can see in my unboxing clip, I’m a little surprised by the amount of power cables at first glance but upon further inspection it all makes sense.<br/>Setup was very easy: 3 cables as seen in the picture. The HDMI cable is a welcome addition compared to the 3-in-1 cables, which are a bit messy, cumbersome and require complete replacement should ONE of them have an issue.<br/><br/>Things to note!<br/>I didn’t bother adjusting the pressure curve settings because they were great out of the box, but I did change the click speed and I also deactivated Windows Ink (I use windows 10). I don’t understand what Windows ink is for but all it seems to do to me is make you unable to drag/select text in input fields.<br/><br/>Conclusion:<br/>All in all, this is a beautiful and affordable piece of equipment. It is technically part of their ‘budget’ line but there is nothing budget about the size or the quality of this device. The size, design and build quality exude class and quality and the pen and pressure sensitivity are best in class.<br/>While the unit is not small, it strikes a perfect balance between spacious and compact. It doesn’t take over your whole desk like my larger units nor does it break the bank at $1200.  I would definitely recommend this to the professional on a budget or a very lucky/forward thinking student or hobbyist.<br/><br/>PROS:<br/>- Buttery smooth &amp; responsive pressure sensitivity<br/>- Smooth but not slick anti-glare surface<br/>- Solid build quality and professional look &amp; feel<br/>- Comes with a sturdy, stable and flexible stand<br/>- Great size with room for longer strokes and all the palettes/windows you may need open<br/>- Stays cool even when working on it all day<br/><br/>CONS:<br/>- “Only” full HD (1920 x 1080) vs the 4k of newer models but I have the 4k model as well and I haven’t been bothered<br/>  by any potential pixelation. All my illustrations are all made at 600 Dpi and I haven't noticed any problems.<br/>- Mine had 1 dead pixel but I only notice it when I look for it. I streamed a commission earlier today in my<br/>  Inkshift Facebook group and didn't notice it once.</span>

<span>To be used for photo editing on Mac Mini with Monterey 12.4. When I received this tablet, I read instructions online since there is nothing in the box but a small card with icons and arrows showing how to connect the tablet and start it.  The card gives you the impression this is a Plug And Play, mais non!  Reading from the site, you realized there is an order to follow to install the software: do not turn on or connect the tablet to your computer.  Install and then connect.  But in my case, even that did not help.  I spent a Sunday PM trying to get it to work, which entails, but is not limited to, reading a lot online, downloading and installing twice, cleaning computer in between, and playing around with computer Preferences to address issues raise by Wacom Support--reading from its Web only--or trying what other users suggested.  The additional challenge is that that recent tablet has been redesigned so it does not offer the buttons or adjustments suggested in videos or messages.  Then I gave up and spent more time cleaning up my Mac with CleanMyMac.  I am exchanging this tablet for a new one of the same model hoping it will work.  I will update this review accordingly.<br/>06-01-22 I just received the new one and it worked perfectly well.  I did not unwrapped it until I was able to test the bluetooth and it paired right away.</span>

<span>Wacom are the industry leader in graphics tablets, and with good reason.  All of their products are extremely high-quality, and the Intuos Pro line is no exception.<br/><br/>This tablet came with the actual tablet itself and USB power cord, the pen, a pen holder with spare nibs stored inside, and a set of colored rings that screw into the pen (so you can customize the pen).  I am going to review the major components of this individually, followed by my overall thoughts at the end.<br/><br/>THE TABLET<br/>The tablet is really top-notch.  It feels great, has a nice heft (not heavy, just solid), and looks professional.  It's mostly made out of metal.  It's extremely high-quality, and without a lot of the kinks that cheaper tablets or even older Wacoms have.  I have the Medium, and it has a huge drawing area.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, the drawing surface has a tendency to scratch really easily.  It comes with a medium texture sheet, which I later replaced with a smooth one, and the standard plastic pen nibs easily scratch both.  I don't carry it around, but I imagine if I stored it in a backpack or briefcase that it would also scratch up pretty fast.  You can buy replacement texture sheets online, and this tablet comes with a card with three tiny samples of each texture--smooth, medium, and rough--but these samples are so small it's basically impossible to get a feel for what drawing on the different textures is like.<br/><br/>The tablet has a set of hotkeys on the side, which you can flip to be on the left or the right side of the drawing area in the driver software.  I really like that feature, as I'm a lefty and keep my keyboard to the right of the tablet already.  You can reprogram each of the hotkeys, but it does get a little complicated--the driver software isn't too intuitive, but it seems like it can give you a lot of control once you figure it out.  I only changed the Command-Z hotkey to a Command-Option-Z hotkey for Photoshop, and that wasn't too difficult.<br/><br/>The other physical feature is a touch ring, which is, well, kind of dumb.  It's not very responsive, and only seems to do what it's supposed to some of the time.  In Photoshop it's set up to zoom in and out by default, and I almost never use it because I can just pinch on my Macbook trackpad and get a reliable result instead of a jumpy, terrible one.  You can also cycle through it to use different settings, like the canvas rotate in Photoshop, but it's still pretty jumpy and awkward.  Maybe I am doing something wrong, but now I pretty much never use it and sometimes find myself hitting it by accident and getting frustrated.<br/><br/>You can use the tablet either tethered to your computer or wirelessly.  I have never used it wirelessly outside of testing it out when I first bought it.  There's just a little bit of a lag that I found distracting, and since I use it with a laptop I have to set them both on the table anyways.  Wireless might be useful if you have a different setup with something like a PC connected to a television, but for me it wasn't worth the lag.  Latency is much better when plugged in, and you don't have to worry about battery life.<br/><br/>Installing the tablet on my Macbook was simple, although it does require you to sign up for a Wacom account to use the driver software.  After installation, it's pretty easy to jump right in to using the tablet.  As I mentioned before, the driver software is not very intuitive, and fiddling with the settings isn't super easy aside from a few simple ones like pressure sensitivity.<br/><br/>Finally, the tablet also functions as a touch input device for your computer--essentially a big trackpad.  You can turn this function on or off in the software, which is nice if you're like me and you brace your hand on the drawing surface.  It's not super great as a giant trackpad, and I prefer to just use my Macbook's which is more reliable.<br/><br/>THE PEN<br/>Some people may not know this, but Wacom has a patent on powerless pen technology.  Technically, the surface of the tablet acts as a magnet that reacts to a coil within the pen itself.  It's complicated stuff, but basically you never have to worry about charging the pen like you do with ones from other companies (including the Apple Pencil and the Microsoft Surface Pen).  To me this is the greatest benefit to getting a Wacom tablet over the cheaper alternatives--it's just one less thing to worry about, and it allows Wacom more freedom in the design of the pen itself.<br/><br/>As a result, the stylus is lighter in weight and can taper comfortably.  It's made of a durable-feeling plastic and the lower half of the pen has a rubberized coating for your hand.  There are two mappable buttons on the side along with the pen nib and eraser, both of which react to the tablet.<br/><br/>It works wonderfully.  Responses are quick and accurate.  It's easy to click on even the smallest of buttons in Photoshop, much more so than the average stylus on a phone or tablet.  The pressure sensitivity is great, and it's able to detect extremely minute shifts in pressure and tilt.  Pressure sensitivity is customizable in the included software, and it can take a little while to find your sweet spot, but the pen is always super responsive.<br/><br/>Lastly, there are a few different types of pen nibs you can purchase to really customize your drawing experience.  It comes with a plastic nib already in it, but there are more hidden in the pen stand.  The plastic ones are nice if a bit scratchy, and feel a bit like drawing with a sharp HB pencil.  They do wear down pretty quickly, especially if you tend to hold the pen in a certain angle most of the time.  I prefer the felt nibs, which are smoother but wear out even faster.  Mine came with a couple nibs of both types, so it's easy to experiment.  There's also a mythical third "flex nib" out there somewhere, but I could never find conclusively that it works with this pen.  And unfortunately, nibs are specific to certain product lines.<br/><br/>THE STAND<br/>The pen holder is a small dome with a thick metal base that unscrews to reveal storage for spare pen nibs.  It's nice and heavy, which is great if it lives on your desk, not so great if you want to travel around with it.  The stand has both a hole for you to insert the pen upright and a divot for you to rest the pen horizontally across it.<br/><br/>There's a small rubber ring on the bottom that keeps it from slipping around your desk, which is a nice touch.  In my opinion, it's a much better design than some of the older pen stands I've seen others use from Wacom.<br/><br/>The only issue I have with the stand is that it's very hard to open and close the bottom.  You have to rotate it just right, but there's not really a good place to grip it so it can be a bit challenging.  I usually take the whole stand between my palms and rotate my whole hands in opposite directions, which works consistently for opening it but is a little less reliable for closing it.  To close it you have to line it up the right way, which is a pain.<br/><br/>OVERALL THOUGHTS AND CONCLUSIONS<br/>This is a great product, and I believe it's truly the best graphics tablet you can buy today (not counting display tablets like the Cintiq).  Wacom really knows their stuff, which is why they're such a trusted brand and have been for decades.  It's a great-quality piece of tech with very little downside in terms of quality, and I think it easily outperforms the alternatives in terms of design and features.  It's just a joy to use.<br/><br/>But now we come to the biggest issue I have with this tablet, and with Wacom products as a whole: price.<br/><br/>This thing is just way too expensive.<br/><br/>At $350, it's more than half the price of an iPad Pro and roughly half the price of a new Microsoft Surface Pro, both of which are great products for creating art but which also do way, way more.  They not only have actual displays on them, eliminating the need to learn to draw without looking at your hand, but they also function as whole computers that do more than just run artist programs.<br/><br/>But this is a product mostly for professional use, so you may not be looking for an iPad or touchscreen computer.  That said, there are so many cheap alternatives that may not meet Wacom's standard of quality but that will get the job done now.  Huion is everywhere right now, and while I haven't gotten to test any of their tablets (though I'd love to) the consensus seems to be that they're getting better all the time.  Wacom will have some stiff competition in the artist space in the next few years.<br/><br/>On top of that, pen nibs, texture sheets, and carrying cases are all a good deal more than they should cost.  The pen nibs are probably the most egregious crime, because they seem to wear out with roughly 10-15 hours of drawing time.  You'd need a million of them if you're a drawing addict.  A worn-down nib will scratch the texture sheet of the tablet, particularly the smooth sheet.  I bought the smooth texture sheet thinking it would wear down the nibs more slowly, but instead it just means the surface of the sheet will wear out more quickly.<br/><br/>Wacom makes great stuff, but their price models kill me.  The Intuos Pro line is expensive, but not outrageous; something like a Cintiq is insane when compared to the alternatives.  Wacom gets away with it because their stuff is admittedly really good and because they have the patent on the most advanced version of this technology.  There's just a massive barrier to entrance and constant recurring costs.  I'd love a Cintiq, but I could never justify the price to myself when I could get a whole computer for the same amount.  As a professional I can see the utility, but as a hobbyist it doesn't make much sense.<br/><br/>All that said, I still would really recommend this product.  It's the best of the best, and a joy to use.  I'm extremely happy with my purchase overall.  If you're serious about your art or design work, this is the graphics tablet to get.</span>

<span>I have been sketching most of my life with paper, pencils, charcoal, pastels etc. Decided I wanted to learn Illustrator and digital art so signed up for a subscription to Creative Cloud. I had a small Wacom Bamboo tablet years ago and it worked fairly well but there were always problems with the software and the Bamboo Dock. After using Illustrator for a couple of weeks with a mouse I realized that if I was going to pursue this seriously I would need to invest in a good graphics tablet. After being led by the nose to Wacom no matter where I searched, I decided to go for the Intelos Pro. Wacom obviously dominates this market and all roads (browsers) lead to them for a "serious" tablet. ONE OF THE BIGGEST MISTAKES I HAVE EVER MADE. I had read many of the reviews and the many problems people have had with this tablet and it's drivers, but due to Wacom's sheer dominance of the tablet market and seeming lack of good alternatives, and Wacom presenting itself as absolute top of the line and must have tablet for serious artists and illustrators, I decided to give it a try. HUGE MISTAKE. TAKE THE BAD REVIEWS VERY SERIOUSLY BEFORE YOU FORK OVER YOUR $350.00 + BUCKS.<br/><br/>The day I got it I plugged the tablet in and downloaded the software. (HP Pavilion High Performance Desktop, Intel Core i7-6700T Processor 2.8GHz, 8GB RAM - Win 7)  Long story short, (because this is going to be long) after four hours of installing and uninstalling the software in every possible configuration, no matter what I did the interface would tell me that there was “no device detected” The windows drivers downloaded and installed with no problem. When I plugged the tablet in my computer would recognize it by the connection sound made by the computer. I tried every port on the computer, all of the multiple other peripherals I have connected to the computer both wirelessly and hardwired work flawlessly. Finally, I called Wacom “support” this is where the nightmare REALLY began. It was two hours and fifteen minutes before the call was answered. After two minutes I was abruptly disconnected. A second call and another two hour wait. Without going into all the minutiae, I was at the level of tech support where they put you on hold for “three to five minutes” while they go to Google and try to figure out what the problem is. Again, long story short, they wasted another two or three hours of my time, and did not resolve the problem. After two or three of these phone calls over two days I was told it would be “escalated” (“forgotten about and dismissed”) and I would be contacted within 24 - 48 hours. Needless to say, the call never came. This is the part of the story where you begin to attempt to track down corporate office phone numbers and reach a supervisor, but, sadly this is nearly impossible anymore as the corporate tech giants management no longer take calls from the plebians. But, I am pretty persistent so I found a corporate number in Portland, Or. and got into their global directory and kept playing keypad bingo with names until I got through to a person. Boy were they surprised!<br/><br/>Explained the problem to the supervisor. Downloaded crash dump files and log files and sent them off to the supervisor. “I will have our engineers look at this and get back to you in a day or two” I told him that was a good one but I had heard it before. “I understand your frustration Mr. Lamm but we will get this resolved! Two days nothing , three days, nothing. I think, well maybe it is the tablet itself so I order the Intos Art and try that out, Got it the next day from Amazon (I LOVE Amazon) Same thing, different day. Tablet would not work. “No device detected” (It uses the same software as the Pro model) So, I now have two expensive Wacom beauties sitting here and over $600.00 bucks invested, and still, nada, zip.<br/>Then I got this from the supervisor:<br/><br/>Dear XXX,<br/>Sorry I was in meetings all day Friday. I followed up with the QA team and then had reviewed the files you send in. They are not able to see the tablet attached.  When you attach the tablet, please look into the Device Manager, it will be listed under Universal Serial Bus Devices. With it not showing up, that means it is not being recognized by the system and going back to our testing the other day, may not be getting enough power, and not showing up in the system. QA's suggestion is to test it on a different tablet, and see if the issue follows the tablet. Please keep me posted. Thanks<br/><br/>XXXXXXX<br/>Customer Support Team<br/>WACOM<br/><br/>So basically he bailed out and told me to fix it myself and keep him posted?  Outstanding. I wrote him back and noted that everyone I dealt at Wacom had failed to keep their word, that it was inconceivable to me that a tech company of this size did not provide remote support. If I have a real knotty problem with one of my computers or my anti virus (Norton) that I can’t figure out they log on and usually problem resolved in under an hour.<br/>So, if you and are a serious masochist I would encourage you to order a Wacom Tablet today!<br/>Seriously, the absolute worst customer service I have ever experienced. About two weeks wasted and a lot of hair pulling and gnashing of teeth. I am not one in general to write reviews, and generally if I do it because I am so pleased with a product or service that I want to help others to get to a good product or service as that is generally so hard to find these days, but hopefully this will save some people a lot of money and aggravation. Now maybe you will get one of these tablets and it will work fine for you. I hope so if you decide to try it. But I believe there are serious issues with their software and drivers and their customer service is without question horrendous. Search it before you buy. DO NOT be persuaded by their chest beating marketing that we ARE THE BEST IN THE UNIVERSE AND YOUR ONLY CHOICE IF YOU ARE A PRO AND SERIOUS. They are not, and there are other good options.<br/>Now the good news. This exercise spurred me on to several days reading reviews on tablets and more angst and hair pulling. I finally after much research bought the Huion H610PRO Painting Drawing Pen Graphics Tablet for about $80.00 total with shipping and an extended warranty. Plugged it in, downloaded the software and ba bam, up and running immediately. It does everything the much more expensive Wacom claims to do at one quarter the cost. Large drawing area but still compact enough that is doesn’t take a lot of desk space. Very comfortable working surface. 2048 levels of stylus pressure sensitivity, 8 customizable express keys and 16 hot keys. It worked  flawlessly right out of the box and I can find no cons so far at all. SO DON’T BE BROW BEATEN BY WACOM. There are other good options, just take the time to do your research (unlike me) before you get sucked in by Wacom’s hype.</span>

<span>After poring over reviews for less expensive tablets I finally decided to purchase the more expensive Intuos Pro (medium size). While pricey, it does not disappoint. It suits my needs perfectly as a 3d artist who suffers from wrist and joint pain. I moved from a mouse to a trackball years ago, and while it helped, it did not alleviate the problem. The pen-tablet combo is even better, for while some movements remain repetitive, many are mitigated through the multiple ways of accomplishing similar tasks. I still pull out the trackball when doing simple things like typing/navigating documents etc., but am using the stylus more-and-more for a variety of applications as I become used to it.<br/><br/>PROS:<br/>●  Intuitive settings interface<br/>●  The included stylus is easy on the hands (mine are large, but not huge: long thin fingers)<br/>●  Bluetooth or Type C connection for wireless or wired use (nice when it works)<br/>●  Mid-size tablet is a perfect size for everything I do (the large would be too much for my tasks)<br/>●  Pen comes with several replacement nibs<br/>●  Tablet surface is sensitive and feels natural to write on for me<br/>●  Has a user friendly "Touch" feature that turns it into a giant track-pad with programmable hand gestures (works really well for me)<br/>●  "Touch" feature can be disabled with the flick of a switch<br/>●  On-tablet programmable buttons, as well as pop-up menus for all or select apps<br/>●  The option to replace the standard (medium) drawing surface (smooth, medium, rough)<br/><br/>CONS:<br/>●  Sometimes the driver stops working (so far not often). Pulling its USB and then plugging it back in takes care of this, and when that fails a reboot is necessary--annoying when in the middle of a work-flow.<br/>EDIT: The bluetooth has consistently broken the tablet drivers--so much so that I stopped using the wireless option. It would be a great feature, if it worked without having to restart the system constantly. My bluetooth adapter works without a hitch with my other devices, so the problem seems to be Wacom's drivers. When plugged in (not using bluetooth) the drivers are much more consistent. Apparently Wacom drivers seem to be an issue with other reviewers as well--hopefully these issues are addressed through updates.<br/>●  The side buttons on the new model are stiff, requiring a bit of pressure to toggle/keep toggled. Repetitive tasks are then more difficult, especially when hand fatigue sets in. As a result I find myself using the keyboard for shortcuts with my left hand while working the stylus with my right. Wacom would do well to lighten the mechanical switch, or provide the option for user defined pressure settings.<br/>●  The "Touch" feature can only be disabled through the mechanical side switch. Some applications do not distinguish well between pen and hand input, making the touch feature undesirable when a stylus is necessary. It is a bit annoying to have to physically toggle a switch when one is using keyboard shortcuts, pop-up menus, etc. Wacom would do well to also include a programmable shortcut etc. for touch on/off (I believe the older version of the Intuos had this feature, but without the mechanical switch--which I do like).<br/>●  The included medium grade drawing surface seems to be wearing out my nibs prematurely. If I end up spending a lot on extra nibs I will take the plunge and replace the surface with its smooth variant, but would rather save the money. For now I am carefully refining my used nibs with 1000 grit sandpaper, which works well-enough.<br/><br/>In spite of these annoyances, I am satisfied with this tablet. Hopefully the next permutation by Wacom will be even better (especially driver stability).</span>

<span>I had gotten this tablet to draw digital art commissions with as it was recommended to me by a few close friends who also use it, however despite the fact my computer has all of the proper ports to support this tablet, it refuses to work with it as well as the tablet's drivers also refuse to install onto my computer as the "Platform is not supported" in addition to my version of Windows is also actively blocking the pen input and has no way of unblocking it, which means I need to get a new computer in order to use this tablet. I do like this tablet, and I was so excited to get started using it, but given how much this tablet costs, I was pretty upset that it didn't work with my current system, which was given to me by my father's company since I couldn't afford to get one on my own at the time my last one croaked.<br/><br/>I have been drawing digital art using only my mouse for the past 13 years and it's finally starting to hurt my wrist on top of the fact that drawing with my mouse, to get the quality I aim for, has me sitting there working for 8 and 12 hours on a single picture. I still have my olde sketch book that I draw in every now and then as well, and so I got the desire to combine the two using this tablet. My computer is a 2014 model ASUS, I am running Windows 7. However, my computer is an experimental build using a bunch of odd parts that were made to work together, so that might be why it isn't compatible with this tablet. I don't know for sure, as I am not very computer-savvy. Ironically though, this tablet does still function as a second monitor in that if I move my cursor all the way to the right, it'll appear on the tablet's screen, but my i3 CPU isn't really strong enough to support it as such, so there's another issue, however the pen input doesn't work due to the drivers refusing to install onto my system. I don't need a second monitor as desk is a big factor that I lack in, and so I had to unplug and re-box my tablet and cords until later on when I can use them. The screen quality on this tablet though, from what i've seen, was very, very impressive, so that gets 5-stars from me.<br/><br/>I do plan to keep this tablet as some of my friends and I are planning to build me a new computer running either Windows 10 or 11 sometime early next year when i'm able to afford it, but I felt that this is something that other potential artists should know, that if you're running Windows 7, there's a big possibility that this tablet won't work on it.<br/><br/>I don't really know how to rate something like this since it is a very nice tablet and I do like it, however I can't use it, so I have no idea what it's functionality is like, nor do I want to return it because i'm sure i'll be able to use it soon, so again, i'll say, if you're running Windows 7 from an older computer like how I am, there's a chance that this tablet won't work on it. ^_^;</span>

<span>I was SO excited to get this product. Of course as other reviews had said, it doesn't connect to inkspace properly on a desktop/laptop. It does connect to my iPad and phone just fine though. My pen came broken at the top, which doesn't affect it's ability to work but is super irritating because I can't put it in the pen holder sleeve. 2 of 4 ink cartridges were also a bust(the first one that comes in the pen, then one of the replacements). All those things were annoying but if it worked as advertised then I'd get over it. Except it totally doesn't. I always get weird lines no matter how I try to draw or use the pen. It's like after each pen stroke it has a seizure.<br/>Oh and I ordered the brown and got the black.<br/>I live overseas so this took a long time to get and will be a pain to turn. This is my first 1-star review and I'm so unhappy. Wacom support also doesn't seem to know very much about their own product. Zero help.</span>

<span> The product provided a very good user experience at the beginning. However, just after 2-3 months, its upper and lower edge, each about 1 cm-wide, turned yellow. It’s very evident during my using, and it affects the color display of my canvas.</span>
