<div class="slideshow-container">
<blockquote><em><div class="a-row a-spacing-small review-data"><span class="a-size-base review-text review-text-content" data-hook="review-body">
<span>This tablet is very simple and user-friendly. I always like this about Samsung products.  The camera ain't all that good but I can use it for video calls and conferences.  Great microphone (good sound),. As far as I can tell it won't link to any phone besides another Samsung to use for texting or as a phone, which I was hoping it would.  I need the bigger buttons due to my arthritis.  Overall it's it's a really nice product.  Would recommend</span>

<blockquote><em><div class="a-row a-spacing-small review-data"><span class="a-size-base review-text review-text-content" data-hook="review-body">
<span>Got this as a 2nd birthday gift for $120. Put on screen protector and kids case. Little one loved it. Worked great. Loved netflix and games on there. Then they spilled a smoothie on it and the power button never worked again. Oh well.</span>
</span></div></em></blockquote>
<p> </p>
<blockquote><em><div class="a-row a-spacing-small review-data"><span class="a-size-base review-text review-text-content" data-hook="review-body">
<span>Love it! The picture quality is great and transferring my data from my old tablet was a breeze. The only drawback is the weight - quite a bit heavier than my old tablet so holding it for a long time gets uncomfortable.</span>
</span></div></em></blockquote>
<p> </p>
<blockquote><em><div class="a-row a-spacing-small review-data"><span class="a-size-base review-text review-text-content" data-hook="review-body">
<span>To be clear, I mainly use this tablet for recreational purposes (X-BOX gaming, Marvel comics reading and MLB watching). Nothing crazy. With that being said, it's definitely a steal of a product. Last tablet I knew that went for around 100 bucks was a bad joke! This one is a quality tablet for the tag though. Good picture quality. Speaker placed on the top and bottom so when in landscape mode, you get that surround sound feeling/effect. Don't get carried away though. They're still just tablet speakers. Lol. My only quarrel is that it has a tendency to lag upon certain actions like switching apps or pulling up the keyboard or typing the first 2 characters. There seems to be a slight delay. I would say about a ½ to ¾ of a second. Battery seems decent. Haven't really been able to dive into it as far as charging time and battery length. But it does hold a charge something serious though. I've been watching live baseball games all day and I only needed the charger twice for the day. All in all, not a perfect tablet but for the price, if you're in need of one, it would behoove you to pick this one up while you still can. ✌🏾<br/><br/>Update:<br/>Battery life is VERY good but charging takes some time.</span>

<span>Good: Inexpensive, high battery life, adequate performance, USB-C charging<br/><br/>Bad:  Hard to hold, thick and heavy for screen size, unacceptable button placement, wireless charging turns device into echo show with ads - a feature I would pay to remove!<br/><br/>I have owned three Fire HD 8 tablets and each generation has gotten more annoying to use because of compromises in the design intended to make them less expensive to produce.  I am extremely happy that Amazon has decided to market this upgraded version with 3 GB of RAM because that is now the minimum needed to run Android or Fire OS smoothly. The 1.5 that came with my second Fire HD8 never worked - it just isn't enough anymore, whereas the 2 GB that came with my first HD8  waa plenty for that era.  I think Amazon was foolish to make that change on the base HD8 because of the added frustration to the end user, but at least there is a choice to upgrade to this "plus" version with its frustration-free 3GB setup.  Is the experience as smooth or responsive as even the least expensive iPad?  Certainly not.  But those start at $400 and this was closer to $120.  What I really want is a $185 option that combines this specification or better with the physical design and form factor of earlier Fire HD8 generations, because when it comes to physical design this generation of Fire tablets is extremely annoying!  I am sure the changes are all designed to minimize cost but please find a better to do that than to put the power and volume buttons so close together with such a similar size and feel.  It is far too easy to press the power button to begin with because it protrudes to far from the case and doesn't have a very strong spring, but when you put it right next to an identical feeling volume button that is just unacceptable!  There is good reason why almost every phone and tablet in the world has these buttons in different locations ( often opposite sides or ends of the phone.)<br/><br/>I happen to believe that it probably would work to have both buttons on the same end as the charger and headphone jack but not if you put them this close together, and give them exactly the same tactile feel and the same overly light spring rate. Please at least recess the power button, use a different surface texture and a stiffer spring. Or better yet move it to the opposite corner where the headphone Jack is now.<br/><br/>And for users with the current, unfortunate design you could eliminate the worst effects with a software update. Just modify the software to require a longer press of the power key before it shuts down the display.  If a one-second press were required then it would eliminate 90% of the instances when I have accidentally shut down the screen trying n to change the volume.  With no security options other than a pass code, tis means I almost every time I try to adjust the volume while listening to a podcast or watching a video I have that experience interupted and I end up having to enter my pass code and physically restart what I was listening to just because I tried to adjust the volume.  This design choice just doesn't work.  Fix it, Amazon!<br/><br/>Another cost saving design choice is that Amazon has allowed the HD8 tablets to get thicker each generation, which I agree is probably reasonable.  But between the thicker body and the much smaller bezel compared to previous generations, I am finding this version much more difficult to hold.  I actually think the sensitivity of the screen might also be a factor because if I put fingers on the front edge if the glass at all this registers as a touch. So to prevent that my fingers must stay on the plastic, and there just isn't enough plastic on the front bit the tablet to get a good grip.  That gives the impression of the tablet being heavier and more awkward than it probably is.  And again this could be an issue that might be addressed with software if the screen sensitivity could be decreased a bit to reject unintended "touches" at the edges ( in this case beyond the edges). of the screen.<br/><br/>My final gripe is going to be about the behavior of the device when put on a wireless charger.  Oddly, when I want to use a wireless charger my intention is to actually charge the device.  It is not to turn my tablet, for which I paid extra to have ads removed from the lock screen into an always on Echo Show with advertising!<br/><br/>I'm sure there are some people who might actually use an Echo Show and for them this must feel like an amazing value.  Like getting a second device for free.  But I just want it gone.  I would never willingly use, much less purchase, an Echo Show, particularly one with a working camera, because I can't accept the privacy and security risk. And I certainly don't want another device showering.me with advertising.<br/><br/>That said, I don't object at all into Amazon including the Echo Show functionality with the tablet, or even having it run by default when you connect it to a wireless charger, but there needs to be clear documentation about how to control this feature and how to turn it off both permanently and temporarily.  Without that I am actually losing two features I specifically paid for on this tablet, wireless charging and freedom from advertising.  Please do a much better job explaining this feature and how to control it as you update the device software</span>

<span>Our family has had so many iPads, iPad Airs, iPad minis... and I can say that - when bought brand spanking new, at the time of release, we were in love. Honeymoons don't last forever, unfortunately, and neither do the tablets. NOT ONCE did we break them beyond being fixable; every single time they've 'updated out' and none of the apps worked. They're not even good for internet after awhile, because even Safari and Chrome have to be updated for use... and the updates will not work with the outdated IOS. Yknow, because $600+ for 2-4 years is acceptable. NOT. But dumb sheeple me, kept on buying them. 🤦🏼‍♀️<br/><br/>I bought my son a 6th Gen iPad mini last November. It was newish and on backorder til about early-mid December. I gave it to him as a gift IN A CHILDPROOF CASE. So it has been protected since I got it. Since before he got it. And two weeks ago it quit charging. Now, he uses his iPad for everything: Communication. Education. Entertainment. Besides the $600 I paid, and even with the $3.49/month AppleCare, it's just totally unacceptable. After taking it to two localish Apple Premium partners, neither of which wanted to fix it and both of which wanted to just sell me a new one, and because all our other iPads (4 that I haven't tossed yet) won't allow him to access his communication apps anymore, I cried and then ordered the Fire Mini on my 23% interest credit card because he needs accessS to something he can communicate on.<br/><br/>I'm, erm, a girl of a certain age.  Getting more and more stubborn about learning new technology stuff. So getting used to this has been a mite frustrating for me. My son, 25 with the cognitivity and resilience of a 2 year old, hasn't skipped a beat. It's early days - and I did buy the 2 year Amazon Protection with the 'FirePad' as we call it - but for $200 plus tax, tag &amp; title 😉 this little Fire Tablet is at least the quality equivalent of the $600 iPad Mini.<br/><br/>The only cons... the display IS just as good as the iPad, though the colors aren't quite as vibrant/vivid. Is that worth $400 more... not for anyone I know. It just takes a little getting used to (I'm talking maybe 2 days with minimal usage by a stubborn adult) and then it's not an issue anymore. The biggest con, though, is that Google won't hop in bed with Amazon - apparently - as willingly as they do Apple. No Google app, no Chrome app, no YouTube app. I just use the Silk browser (Bing... YUCK!) type in Google for Google searches or YouTube to watch videos. Maybe 3 seconds of frustration but it does remember my YT log in after the first time, so there's that to help lessen the annoyance for when I use it. (My son watches YouTube on his TV anyway.)<br/><br/>CLIFF NOTES: 🔩🍎. 💸🔥<br/>(Screw Apple. Buy Fire.)</span>

<span>I do not mean "Wild" kindly, but I'll get to that shortly. Sorry for the long read, but I have a lot of thoughts about this particular product to inform you, the end-user of your purchasing decision before you commit a purchase, and as a responsible citizen of the Internet, I've heavily tested the tablet hands-on to see what I can make it do, how I can make it work and where Amazon's hires could improve the overall experience for a multi-adult household.<br/><br/>The tablet itself is functional. What else is there to say about it? Inside a home or building, so long the sun isn't shining directly on it the display is bright, with a clear, crisp display and along with a decent battery much bigger than your current handheld mobile device, you also get anywhere between a mediocre and acceptable tablet use experience, depending on how much money you hand to Amazon. I painfully regret not going with the Fire HD 10, but I am a bit of a cheapskate and after having seen what comes with the Fire HD Kids' Pro 8 through an encounter with a daughter of my mother's friend, I figured the Fire HD 8 Plus would be the same exact experience — and I can happily say, it is.<br/><br/>The inclusion of a three-pole phone socket for headphones and TF / micro SD slot for extra storage practically makes it the ideal tablet computer… until you try to use it as a multi-user tablet computer. But we'll get to those gripes later. First impressions of the hardware makes it seem like the absolute perfect device for personal and work use, domestic and abroad. A simple tablet with great features. Except for a GSM / SIM slot but if you already have a mobile handheld, the Fire can use wireless tethering whenever the tablet needs access to the Internet where WiFi isn't available, and it can do calls via WiFi so that's something if your friends aren't using any of the supported social network platforms available through Amazon's app market.<br/><br/>Fire OS on the other hand, that's uhm — fun. Yes, fun. If you receive nothing else from this, should you be the sole adult of the tablet, then you have nothing to worry about. Everything just works — for you. For anyone else? Yeah, nah. Show mode is honestly a great inclusion, as well Alexa Hands-Free — it's like if you have a general-purpose tablet, Amazon Show desktop unit and phone (which can only do calls via WiFi) for what was at the time of Prime Day anywhere between sixty and eighty dollars depending on device capabilities. What a bargain!<br/><br/>…For the primary user. Second adult? Nah, can't do Show Mode, Alexa Hands-Free or WiFi calling. But children can do calls with approved contacts and permission from their parents! That hardly makes any sense — if you're not a child you don't get to make calls beyond the primary profile? Why? Speaking of kids, if you think that kids' launcher or adult settings will let you move off all of the kids' apps to an SD card, ha ha nope. So your child will very likely make using the tablet almost impossible after they stuff the internal storage with nothing but pointless games.<br/><br/>For a couple, it makes even less sense to buy this for the intent of using voice recognition features. Sure, auto guy and shop girl can keep their profiles separate, but only one of them get the privilege of using all of the tablet's features. A second adult profile is like a grown-up kid, and feels almost demeaning, which likely means whoever wears the pants between two people will be the one with the primary account which does everything. And what if they want to share applications? There's no easy way to do this beyond reinstalling them on the other profile. I've looked, and there seems to be no way of easily sharing apps between adult profiles which especially makes installation of such things as Google Play a major drag without third-party guidance and tools.<br/><br/>It's an Amazon device, so of course it will advertise Amazon everything — even Washington Post. If you don't use that service, too bad can't disable. If you don't care about Amazon's other services, too bad shove it in a folder on the Fire Launcher. Without tinkering beyond what Amazon allows you to do, it kind of makes using the tablet a terrible experience being inundated with all of these Amazon-owned things at once, and for some people the constant upselling is enough to warrant a return.<br/><br/>If you can get over all of that — and again, if you are the sole adult of the tablet, none of the above save for the upsells are really an issue — then you have yourself a capable and handy little Android-based tablet which will do almost everything you want. A solid product with a mediocre and terribly flawed OS, but one if you've committed your entire life to Amazon may be welcome. As I exhibit no such brand loyalty I'm exceedingly annoyed, but all of the thorns and papercuts are nothing a little bit of tinkering cannot cleave and become rid of.<br/><br/>EDIT 07/06/21.1: Minor correction, seems like while four-pole may fit, I can't use external mic with the tablet or Fire OS doesn't disclose how to do this.<br/>EDIT 07/06/21.2: Grammar and error corrections</span>

<span>I am a fan of Amazon's tablet offerings and have been for years. I do also have iPads, which I use for music related apps. but for everyday uses the Fire HD tablets are a very smart option.<br/>What I like:<br/>1. Price - you get a lot of computer for relatively little money<br/>2. Screen &amp; Speakers - Amazon has improved the resolution and brightness of their tablet screens over the last few years that rival Apple, Samsung, etc. Movie audio is crisp and loud enough, even streaming music isn't bad on the built-in stereo speakers<br/>3. Battery - on the 8" and 10" Fire HD tablets you will get impressive battery life, especially if you take the effort to power off if you won't be using it for a few days. The 7" tablet does not have quite the same battery life however, from my experience<br/>4. Everyday uses - Amazon's browser, email, office, games, entertainment, audio books, music, etc integrated apps are well thought out and work intuitively and efficiently on these tablets.<br/>5. Entertainment and shopping - if you're a Prime member the Fire HD tablet is really a no-brainer, especially if you watch Prime or other prescription streaming video or do any amount of shopping at Amazon or Whole Foods<br/>6. Alexa and Smart devices - the Fire HD tablets easily work together with your home Smart devices, such as Ring doorbells and security detectors and are quite versatile too. You can sync them with your Echo devices, TVs, security video cameras, etc. You can even use them to communicate with other Fire tablets in your home - almost like a video intercom system<br/>7. Updates - Amazon is always improving the functionality of their devices so new features often appear with OS updates. Basically you're getting more than you paid for over time.<br/><br/>What I don't like so much:<br/>1. Fire OS - Amazon has done a great job with their operating system but still has some work to do as far as multi-tasking, efficiency and compatibility with certain file protocols. Also the internal filing system and access to the SD card for storage is a little clunky. Transferring files from one device to another can be confusing<br/>2. Camera integration - the Fire HD tablets have decent cameras (well, the front one is decent) but they don't seem to play that well with the included photo app - and the filing system apart from Amazon Cloud is again, somewhat non-intuitive. This is something that obviously can be remedied with software updates, hopefully soon.<br/>3. 3rd party applications - Amazon is pretty strict about which apps can be used with the Fire OS (you cannot download from GooglePlay) so there are likely a few apps you like that will be unavailable - unless you hack the tablet to run as a straight-up Android device, which defeats the purpose of having an Amazon device in the first place. So..<br/><br/>That pretty much covers it from my perspective. The Fire HD 8" &amp; 10" are a real bargain in the Android-ish tablet market, IMHO. I really love mine and use them daily and believe you will love yours too!</span>

<span>This is my second Lenovo tablet. The last one lasted about 4 years of heavy use. When Lenovo updated the OS recently, the audio stopped working, and then the video, too. Apparently the built in Dolby Sound software was incompatible with Android 10. The touch screen is a bit wonky, like zooming in with minimal touch. But overall, I'm quite satisfied.

<span>The battery life has to be my biggest complaint, it really cannot hold a charge over night while turned off. It's best to keep it on the charger when not in use to garuntee they can use it later.<br/>I'm also not a fan on how the downloaded apps are stored, I like to make specific folders and keep them more organized but I didn't see a way to do that.<br/>My son does really enjoy the Disney number &amp; alphabet apps and the Elmo app though and has enough storage for 2 seasons of Bluey downloaded into it when we travel.</span>

<span>This is perfect for my almost 4 year old. It's tough, it's easy to use. It's big enough that he won't lose it but small enough for him to hold comfortably. There is a wide variety of games, and they aren't lame.</span>

<span>My boys love their tablets. BUY THE CASE.  Just the other day, my husband put our youngest in the car and left his tablet sitting on the roof of the car.  Needless to say as we were driving 45 mph the tablet flew off the roof, bounced 3 times on the road and off to the side of the road.  We pulled over and found it, NO SCRATCHES, SCUFFS, DENTS.  The tablet works perfectly!!!</span>

<span>LOVE THIS!!! The parental controls are great, it comes with lots of apps. Youtube has about 10 or so videos already on there for them with no ads. You can't search on YouTube so i don't have to worry about unwanted videos. My toddler loves it and i love that i can monitor everything. My toddler is 20 months.</span>
