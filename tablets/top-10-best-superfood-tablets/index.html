<span>It's EXTREMELY hard to find a greens drink that doesn't have added enzymes. Enzymes hate me because the last time I thought I needed them, landed me in the Dr's office for horrible stomach pains. They ate my stomach lining! Ya, fun times! This stuff is great just the way it is. Sure, there are enzymes in it but they are natural and aren't added. At first I wasn't too excited about this. My naturopath told me I needed to start adding greens to my diet. I'm 48 and hate veggies. So I went on a quest to search for something that had what I needed without added chemicals, and didn't have stevia. Haha.... Good luck with that because you won't find it and if you do, please tell me. 95% of supplements on the market today are not catered to people looking to GAIN WEIGHT or want decent flavor! Cane sugar is also unheard off. They are catered to people looking for no sugar, no carbs, no gluten, no calories. And it absolutely sucks for people like me or people that need to gain weight due to illness. Also me. So I started reading reviews on over 50 different greens products. All of them had either no sugar, stevia or sucrolose. Yuck. Yuck and yuck. So then I thought about making my own. Too expensive. And then I just said screw it because I was getting tired of seeing products only catered to the 95%. So I let it go for awhile. I even researched on how to start my own health food line because seriously!..... We just fall thru the cracks. Months went by and I said ok. I really need something. I chose this one. It had more reviews on how good it tasted even with the Stevia. On a side note, stevia makes me sick. I HATE the aftertaste. It gives me headaches and sometimes companies get carried away with how much they put in their products which makes it even worse. Moving along...<br/>I got it in the mail. Smelled very green. Added a tab to 8oz of water. Takes awhile to dissolve. Took one very tiny sip. Blech!! Oh no! I am not drinking this garbage. Set it down. Walked away. Came back to it and tried again. This time with lots of ice cubes to keep it cold. Bigger sip. Still nasty. Drank it anyway. Literally choked it down. God aweful. I felt like I needed a gold star for that! The next morning I spent an extra long time in the bathroom. It was green! TMI I know but holy hell it was green! I skipped a day and grudgingly plopped in another tab to try it again. Lord help me. Next day... Something miraculous happened. I felt amazing! I used up all the tabs and yup.... I bought more. Blood Orange flavor the 2nd go. And the 3 more go's after that.<br/>Moral of the story is that there isn't going to be a greens drink that is going to taste like rainbows. If there is, sign me up. But until that happens, this will rock your Sox. The stevia is very minimal. So far no headaches and no horrible aftertaste. I'm now on month 2 of this and I do... I feel great. I have more energy, I sleep better, my body gets its nutrition, my bathroom trips have been normal now. My only caveat is the price. For 10 tablets, it fluctuates between $12-$15. Since I drink this almost every day, it adds up. The 30 day supply is almost $50 which is crazy insane! I'm really hoping that the price comes down otherwise I feel I might have to go on another greens quest again. I think $28 would be a good price for 30 tablets. $8-$9 for the 10 tab.</span>

<span>It tastes really good (the peach flavor) and is faintly like matcha minus the caffeine. Caffeine isn't good for my heart and that is why I am pickier than others about powder based nutrition. I was tentative about the Stevia but it doesn't seem to affect me. As an old cold presser myself, this brings me back to the green juices I used to make for the same benefits. Those drinks don't contain fiber too you know. You're extracting nutrients without too much damage.<br/><br/>As someone mentioned, the sodium is a bit high but not much more than the usual. Was drawn to this product over all the others because of the simple ingredients which are mainly veggies.<br/><br/>I just really like the convenience and taste. You can jazz up any cup of water and get easily soluble nutrients which will always be more better than a can of soda for your health.<br/><br/>It did relieve immediate heartburn and heartache plus left arm numbness so there is a medicinal benefit. I'm happy to take this instead of eating a full meal and can easily incorporate into my diet. Zinc and potassium are crucial minerals that is lacking in most diets. And the spirulina and kale are simply healthy to consume. You will have health bowel movements and detoxing but people who juice are familiar with this and I wouldn't say it's drastically different.<br/><br/>Each canister fits so nicely in my small purse. But I enjoy drinking it at home with a plain cup of water.</span>

<span>After my mother (who used to sell Shaklee vitamins) tried convincing us for FIVE years to try alfalfa for my husband’s seasonal allergies, I FINALLY threw in the towel and bought this for him to try. He‘s the type who truly SUFFERS from terribly itchy eyes every spring. He literally tried everything from the Pharma-type antihistamines to homeopathy tinctures, even the prescription-strength eyes drops that cost $150!! All offered ZERO improvement. (We literally had to move back up north his allergies were so miserable for him in NC.) We started him on it right when we saw the early Yellow Forsythia bushes start to bloom (so he’s Brent along it for about 3-4 weeks now) and he’s LITERALLY had zero allergy symptoms occur this year. Not a single sneeze. Not a single tear form. No itching/burning. A total non-reaction to it even on “high pollen” days. It’s as close to a miracle as we’ve ever seen a supplement produce.<br/><br/>(After easing other reviews her about it’s help with pain, I’m gonna start to take it for muscle aches/pain and see if it helps.)</span>

<span>I have been taking herbs for several years now, but several months ago  started incorporating Alfalfa in our daily regimen.  I must say we do use this brand along with the bulk powders in another brand for shakes.  My husband and I take about 6 to 8 tablets per day.  We told our sweet dog this was a cookie , lol and she thinks they are treats and chews them right up.  They tastes like grass which dogs eat, so I am pleased she is getting nutrition too. She gets  about 3 to 5 tablets a day.  I love Now brands and the fact you get 500 tablets is a great deal, because you really need a teaspoon  a day to start addressing chronic issues you might have. Look up the benefits.<br/>Once you get them in your system you will start noticing positive changes in your body.  Can’t explain it just try it for yourself.  Also Eat healthy too, all the supplements in the world won’t help you unless you change your lifestyle.  The Sad American diet is killing people everyday.  After going through Cancer years ago I now eat a raw whole plant based food diet only, you can eat lightly steamed / cooked whole plant based too.  If you need motivation and will power watch health and food documentaries titled fat, raw food  fasting etc  on Netflix and Amazon prime. Unfortunately my husband continues to eat a terrible diet no matter how much I try to get him to change his food choices.  You have to really want it  Here’s to great health!</span>

<span>About four years ago I made the mistake of having a dentist put amalgam fillings in several of my teeth. After a couple of months passed I started having severe neurological disorders, visual migraines, hallucinations and MS like symptoms. I spent over a year searching for a root cause that might explain the new and rather sudden onset of awful symptoms. I saw doctors, neurologists, had my brain scanned for tumors, changed my diet several times and then, before giving up, it dawned on me that the issues started right after getting the fillings. I argued with doctors and my insurance company for a couple of months, trying to convince them that I needed to remove the fillings and detox. Once I realized (and it didn't take long) that they didn't have any intention of actually fixing the root cause and instead insisted on treating the symptoms, I quickly found a dentist that would safely remove the amalgam and found a product called HMD (Heavy Metal Detox) to detox the metal. After the removal and the detox I was cured.<br/><br/>A few months ago I noticed that something was wrong with me again. I was losing fine motor skills (my hands would shake when using them for precision tasks) and my arms and legs began to feel disconnected from me, as if my brain was losing connection to them. I am not quite sure what was wrong with me this time (still haven't figured it out) but the symptoms were curiously similar to when I was poisoned by amalgam and the cure I used last time had chlorella in it. It was a no brainer.<br/><br/>I went to the local Whole Foods here in Austin and bought the 200mg 300 tablet pack for $37.00 (notice the amazon.com price is cheaper :) ). After taking Sun Chlorella for three months the symptoms have once again completely disappeared and additionally, taking this stuff is like putting a supercharger on the human brain. I literally have what feels like ten times the mental processing power as I did before I started taking this product. I am able to make connections to sections of my brain that are relevant to the context of whatever I am doing instantly, effortlessly and with targeted precision. I work for a software company and deal with some very complex situations and I have noticed a HUGE difference in my work and so have my co-workers. I have also noticed about a two fold increase in alertness and overall energy throughout the day.<br/><br/>I can't thank the makers of chlorella products and the Sun product enough. This stuff has literally saved my life. THANK YOU!!!<br/><br/>PS: Don't let the naysayers do your thinking for you. Listen to your intuition, read the reviews and most importantly try the product yourself before making up your mind if it works or not (which is the only way to really know).</span>

<span>I am on my second bottle of these vitamins and ONLY because I can feel the positive difference they make in how my body feels. However, in order to swallow these pills (couldn't they make them in a gel cap?) I cut them into four pieces.  Others may be able to break them in two but my point is that, as good as these are I would HOPE that the company could and will find a way to manufacture them in a more digestible size.</span>

<span>I have been taking 'One N Only' for well over 2 years now, and I feel safe in writing a 5-star review for these amazing vitamins! I have to say these are the best multi-vitamin I have ever bought. They absolutely cause NO discomfort if you take them on an empty stomach, and I have had several bad experiences with other harsh brands causing instant upset, etc. Next, you get a great deal of energy, these are loaded with B vitamins. I haven't had any adverse effects and really have had an overall positive experience. Well worth the price tag, I noticed my hair growing better, my nails becoming stronger and my energy levels increased. If you are on the fence, I would recommend getting a bottle and trying them, since they have really worked well for me.<br/><br/>The only drawback some may have is these are naturally packed with lots of nutrition which does  make for a big pill, but they're no worse than a Centrum, or any other multi that I have tried. Not too bad of a taste, kind of grassy/mineral flavored.</span>
