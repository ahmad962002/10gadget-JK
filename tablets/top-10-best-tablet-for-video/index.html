<blockquote><em><div class="a-row a-spacing-small review-data"><span class="a-size-base review-text review-text-content" data-hook="review-body">
<span>I spent some time with both the Intel and this AMD version of the 2021 Win Max. I had left a review for the Intel version on another listing, mentioning a few things that made me want to test the AMD version to see if it would improve. Fortunately, it definitely improved and impressed me enough to want to keep this unit.<br/><br/>My original idea was to combine my 2 separate devices (gaming laptop and GPD Micro PC) into one. The Win Max's form factor is the most appealing to me compared to basically all other handhelds since they do not have a touch-typing usable keyboard (ignoring the detachable keyboard of the OneXPlayer). I also wanted an AMD powered device since Intel's graphics drivers leave much to be desired.<br/><br/>I have tested my unit with both Windows and Manjaro Gnome with Wayland. Windows currently offers a bit better performance and overally game stability with some of my titles (Risk of Rain 2, COD BO3, as examples). I will note that I had basically no issues with Linux using the AMD Win Max (touchscreen, brightness, volume, WiFi, wake from sleep and all inputs were working out of box), besides having to rotate the screen in the display settings. The Intel unit experienced difficulties with wake from sleep and random graphical artifacts. Different versions of the kernel and switching to X11 didn't fix anything for me.<br/><br/>The XInput controls, keyboard, touchpad and touchscreen are all satisfying to use for general OS navigation and gaming. All gamepad buttons are clicky and responsive. The joysticks are admittedly limited in range, but they do serve their purpose well. I'm hoping that they don't exhibit drift issues anytime soon. Triggers and bumpers are using mouse button switches that feel nice, but sacrifices analog trigger functionality. I don't play any racing games, so it's not a big deal for me.<br/><br/>The screen is exactly the same panel as on the Intel unit, so you should expect some slow pixel response times causing noticeably smeary looking motion. It's easy to get used to, but definitely not clear compared to the majority of panels on the market. It's enough for me to ding 1 star.<br/><br/>Battery life is competitive with other similar handhelds. As far as I know, this device may have the largest battery capacity out of the x86 handheld market (I would need to double-check about the OneXPlayer 1S, which may be a bit smaller). My unit came with the "Normal" 20w TDP setting, and I chose to keep ot there for all my usage. I haven't found myself struggling with the battery life, since most games I play are relativley lightweight. The lowest I have seen is roughly 2 hours in games like BO3 and Valheim (by the way, Valheim offers more performance under Linux!). That is still on 20w TDP, so it could definitely be improved by lowering that to 15w and dropping some settings, or even limiting framerstes to 30. When I have it attached to my desk setup with a USB C dock, it feels like a very reaponsive and powerful mini desktop that can still game. Do note that USB C display out isn't officially supported, so you will need to use the HDMI port.<br/><br/>Overall, I can recommend this product to others who are looking for a truly powerful laptop in a very portable size with decent built-in gamepad controls. It's a niche product with a high price tag that doesn't compete well with normal laptops of the same price range, so if you aren't specifically after this type of product, then it will not be worth it. For me, it definitely serves its purpose well and satisfies everything I wanted out of it.</span>

<span>This handheld is not for the faint of heart. It required a lot of tlc at start up because I find that there are a lot of updates for firmware for the keyboard/controllers, and firmware for update for windows 10 and 11. I did expect SOME updates for drivers and such, but firmware/ bios? And on top of that it arrived with a hairline crack in the upper left hand of the screen that I didn't notice until after I started the firmware updates.....<br/><br/>All in all, it was a pain...will be returning this and seeing if I can get something that isn't so fragile OR high maintenance.</span>

<span>I was an early adopter of Android tablets many years ago. I found tablets to be not ready at all for mass-marketat the time. The exception to this were the Apple Ipads, but they were limited in functionality even though very slick. Since, I have been using android Phablet Style smartphones and have become quite used to them. They all have their quirks and differences and most do not shine. Since, I travel a decent amount, I found lugging a laptop or Chromebook around to be just that and not useful as power-hungry devices. While on a crowded airplanes flight, I watched John Wick 3 over-the-shoulder of another passenger via his S7. Even though there was no sound, I was delighted at the amazing resolution and media play of the movie. I resolved then and there did I would buy one after the price came down, cuz I was balking at the $700 price tag. My patience was rewarded and I got a pretty decent discount last fall.<br/><br/>I really like the device, the pen, and the ability to draw and take notes. The sound is rich and full and does not need headphones to hear clearly like other devices who sound tinny and distorted. However, there are USB C Jack's to 3.5 mm headphone plugs readily available for not much money, or you can Bluetooth.<br/><br/>There are other positives about this device such as it is lightweight and has a long battery life. And memory can be extended to 1 terabyte which I think is pretty impressive.<br/><br/>Now to the little bit of the bad oh, I'm going to be brutally honest about it. I am here in the Google/ Android ecosystem and rely upon my account for password storage and this usually works seamlessly across Android devices and Chrome browser. Once I set up the device with my Google account usually it's no problem to access my passwords once I've installed the apps that need them. Not so in this case with Samsung. It wants you to join their ecosystem oh, and I see no reason duplicate everything which I find to be insecure and overly complicated. In this day and age it's a real nightmare because everyone demands passwords that are complicated and impossible to keep track of by yourself. I am not interested in installing third party key ring managers to try and mitigate this. The password autofill culpability in this device is very complicated to set up if you're not using a Samsung account even though my device which is logged into my Google account. Overall, I find the settings to be extremely fussy and difficult to use in general and not very intuitive in setting up and across some of the apps provided. I have spent hours and hours trying to establish better usability in this regard, and I feel that this is the main drawback to the Galaxy S7. I do not say that it ruins the experience, but I am less likely to buy another Samsung product particularly a phone because of this. In addition, the keyboard swipe works like crap in landscape mode, and the dictionary is atrocious. I might be able to fix the dictionary by finding a more compatible database. Of course I have to mention Google speech to text is almost unusable without clearly and loudly enunciating each syllable of every single word no matter how simple. Not something you want to do in public you will look like a crazy person! Google speech definition used to be pretty good now crap across all of their devices. Practically useless and on this S7 it is no difference. Hopefully this gets resolved<br/><br/>Great look, performance, sound also. Disappointingly, still not ready for prime time due to aforementioned issues and others that have yet to reveal themselves.<br/><br/>Admittedly, you'll probably have a much easier time with this tablet if you just acquiesce and join the Samsung ecosystem. Of course, that means they will win and you will be under their thumb and I can assure you and they can be as arbitrary and hamfisted as Google.<br/><br/>Good luck buy on sale only.</span>

<span>I purchased this tablet solely for the purpose of displaying scanned sheet music for playing piano.  I purchased it in conjunction with the Firefly PageFlip page turning pedal, and I've been extremely happy with both.  The display on the tablet is brilliant, and battery life is excellent.  The size is perfect for clearly displaying a full sheet of music.  I highly recommend to anyone looking to convert from paper to digital.</span>

<span>This is my third Samsung tablet and it works very well.<br/><br/>Because manufacturers don't support their Android tablets forever, only allow you to update operating systems for a limited time and they also stop providing security updates after a couple years, you end up needing to upgrade the tablet every 3 or 4 years.  Also the batteries don't seem to last as long on a full charge as they did when new so you either open them up to replace them or bite the bullet and buy a new tablet.  This is generally what I do and I've been sticking with Samsung for many years.<br/><br/>Samsung makes a great product and this Galaxy Tab S7 works well.  You can find plenty of reviews online.<br/><br/>My only real complaint is that this one is heavier than my previous tablets so it's more of a chore to hold for a long time such as when watching several TV shows in a row or a full-length movie.  My iPad is lighter as are my previous Samsung tablets.  Otherwise this is as good as any other Galaxy model.<br/><br/>Be very aware this does not have a 3.5mm audio jack so you either have to use the built in speakers or a Bluetooth headset/earbuds.<br/><br/>I highly recommend Samsung's tablet for anyone wanting to stick with Android.</span>

<span>I bought the S8 (I liked the smaller size) and that it will be getting security updates longer than the S7. But the main use is for streaming and the difference between the S7+ OLED and the S8 TFT is SUBSTANTIAL in Dark Scenes and there are a surprising number of dark scenes in movies. YouTube videos would be fine, etc. but movies and TV shows really demand a superb screen and the S7+ brings it. (I got the S7+ for LESS than the s8 during Amazon Prime days so it was a no brainer. The s8+ was beyond my price limit.)<br/><br/>The only downside to the S7+ is the size. It is a BIG tablet and hard to handle with one hand by the time you put a quality cover on it.<br/><br/>P.S.<br/>I called Amazon support to confirm that a seller of Amazon.com versus just Amazon was essentially the same thing and they confirmed I was buying new. (Always check the seller..)</span>

<span>For context, I purchased this tablet on sale for $109.00. Additionally, I have been using Samsung Galaxy S series phones for a decade, previously used a Samsung tablet from about 2013-2015, and currently use both a Fire HD 8 (2020 model) tablet and a Fire 7 (2019 model) tablet. Finally, I purchased this because I needed a tablet with access to Google Play Services for a specific set of purposes.<br/><br/>First of all, it's important to keep in mind that the Galaxy A series is Samsung's "budget" line of tablets and smartphones, and this is the cheapest of their tablets. The performance is not going to be as good as the flagship Series S or Series Z devices; if you have, for example, an S22 as your phone, you should not expect the performance of this tablet, the screen, etc to match that. It also is not going to meet the specs and quality of iPads, Surfaces, or other high-end tablets. That being said, Android tablets overall are much better quality than they were several years ago, which my experience with this tablet has confirmed for me.<br/><br/>The screen is good--much better than I expected. Everything is clear and sharp, and there's basically no pixilation. It does have a lower pixel density than a lot of other devices, but more than most budget Android tablets. The screen can also be slightly difficult to view from certain angles, although that shouldn't be an issue for 99% of use cases; it can also be a bit difficult to see in brighter lights. In terms of physical qualities, it's basically the same as the screen on my S21.<br/><br/>The sound is also better than I expected. It doesn't seem to carry as far as other devices--once again, not a huge issue--but it's loud and clear. The fact that there's an audio jack is appreciated, and one can always connect a speaker or headphones via bluetooth.<br/><br/>The extra 1GB of RAM compared to my Fire HD 8 is definitely noticeable in most cases, although this is still not what I would call a speedy device. If you're just watching video, listening to audio, and reading, this will be irrelevant to you outside of saving a second or so when you open an app, pull up the keyboard, or turn on the tablet. I have not played any games on it, but I assume that more demanding ones would have some noticeable difficulties on this.<br/><br/>Battery life seems great so far. The tablet supports fast charging, but the included charger does not.<br/><br/>The tablet is lightweight, although compared to my Fire HD 8, it is not as comfortable to hold. The materials used are also very nice, and it doesn't look or feel like a budget tablet. It's small enough that fitting it into most bags or purses shouldn't be difficult. The fact that storage is also expandable up to 1 TB is appreciated. The charging port is USB-C, which is basically standard nowadays, although many budget devices still use micro-USB, so it's worth mentioning.<br/><br/>The cameras are adequate, and are fine for Zoom, Skype, and other video sites. I have not used the microphone, but I assume it's also serviceable.<br/><br/>There are seemingly some interesting options to connect this to a Samsung phone, although I am not using those. Still, this could be a nice option for some people.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, there do not seem to be very many good cases available for this model. There do appear to be a lot of "heavy-duty" cases for it though, which is nice if you're purchasing this for a young child.<br/><br/>Overall, if you can get this on sale--especially if you *have* to have access to Google Play Services or otherwise can't or don't want to use Fire OS--this is definitely a great choice for a tablet. It will get updates and remain usable for far longer than similarly-priced and cheaper Android tablets from Onn, Chinese manufacturers using the names of old American brands, and the like. That being said, if you're primarily looking for a device for consuming content--which is what the overwhelming majority of people use tablets for--I'd still recommend the Fire HD 8, especially during one of the many times per year that it goes on sale, as I don't feel that the differences are worth the extra $50.00-$110.00 the A7 Lite will cost. Still, this is probably the best inexpensive Android tablet on the market today, and is a fantastic option to consider if you're looking to purchase one.</span>

<span>It's a good tablet, but remember it isn't a flagship. The screen is great but remember it isn't as good as the higher models or something like an iPad pro screen. I wanted something a little smaller than my 12.9, and love that I could get the 11" at a considerable savings and keep thr 120hz screen. Once you've gotten used to anything above 60, it's so hard to go back. And don't get me started on the micro SD, it's so convenient to be able to just drop in and have extra space.<br/><br/>I think Samsung Dex is great on these devices, much better than something like the iPad pro, that we've all been promised will be able to replace a PC. But even with ios 16 it's more of the same. Picked up the pink tablet since I always put a cover on it and the savings over charcoal or silver was 60 bucks.<br/><br/>Anyway, it's a light device, screen looks good, and comes with the pencil.  Is it worth the price, I'd say definitely. Is the screen as good as my fold 4, of course not. As good as the iPad pro, no. But those devices were well over 1000 dollars and neither came with the pen. I think it comes down to your ecosystem. I have both apple and Samsung android and love the way they both handle sharing if using two apple or two Samsung devices.</span>

<span>I purchased this tablet because I thought having a big screen tablet would be cool and the specs of this tablet were beyond awesome.  However, I am in the middle of returning it and I'll tell you why.<br/><br/>Don't let the fact I'm returning it steer you away from considering this tablet.  For most, this tablet may be perfect except for people like me that had the negative issues mentioned down below.<br/><br/>First of all the pros:<br/><br/>- During the few days I had this, I used it a lot like a laptop.  I had a Bluetooth keyboard and a Fintiecase with it that stood it up.  I also had a Bluetooth mouse that worked right away when connected.  There is an option called "Dex" that loads a desktop environment which makes the tablet seem very much like a PC, and it did it well.<br/>- Performance was as expected for the most part with a few hiccups *see cons below*.  It was snappy, fluid, and responsive.<br/>- The high point is the screen.  The screen is beautiful.  The Colors Pop.  The sharpness is outstanding.<br/>- Sound is awesome as well.  Does better than most laptops I have ever used.<br/>- the 12-inch screen is huge, and with the high definition this screen has, can fit quite a bit on the screen if you choose to.  Using apps side by side was really awarding.<br/>- For a tablet, the camera was really impressive.<br/><br/>Cons<br/><br/>- Weight.  Using it in landscape orientation isn't too bad.  However, if you play some games that only work in Portrait orientation, holding the tablet does start to give you hand fatigue, in my case in as little as a few minutes.  So if you are a reader and want to hold it like a book vertically, you stand a chance of discomfort trying to hold it in portrait mode.<br/>- While the snapdragon chip that is included in this tablet should be more than enough to do most tasks, the few programs I used that streamed games and or shows seem to always have a micro stutter, and I spent most of the time having this trying to fix the problem and find out which of Samsungs programs are bogging the tablet down.  I never found it out.  Hence why I returned it.<br/><br/>If you are going to use it like a laptop with a keyboard, this is an awesome solution.  However, if you plan on using it in your hands a lot.. well with big size comes the loss of some portability.  The tablet is pretty heavy.  If you don't mind that, then the tablet will be perfect for you.  However, the Regular Galaxy tab S8 will be more than enough for those that want the portability and lightness of a tablet, despite the unfortunate decision of Samsung to leave out the Amoled screen.<br/><br/>Also, Samsung has given their word that these tablets in the S8 will have updates for 5 years, and a soon-to-come update will focus on making android, even more, tablet friendly.<br/><br/>To summarize:  If you want to stream games (Moonlight, Steam Link, Playstation Remote play) to this tablet, it didn't seem to work well, despite an old laptop of mine doing it just fine.  If you do this, don't get this tablet.  There is a possibility that a future update may fix this.<br/>If you want something light and easy to carry... don't get the S8 plus or S8 ultimate, stick with the regular S8.  The S8 plus was heavy and not as portable as other smaller tablets.<br/>If either of these issues doesn't apply to you, then the S8 Plus is an amazing tablet.  But overall, if you don't mind the slightly lighter blacks of an IPS screen and just over an inch of a smaller screen, stick with the S8 and save yourself some money.</span>

<span>Intro<br/><br/>Nowadays you're seeing more and more students switching from a laptop to a tablet for all of their productivity and entertainment. Although laptops are more portable than ever, It's pretty clear students appreciate an, even MORE, portable setup. That's where the Samsung Galaxy Tab S8 steps in. This is one of my favorite Android tablets on the market, but if you’re a student, it has some serious competition from Apple. So, is the Galaxy Tab S8 the best tablet for students? Well, Let’s find out!<br/><br/>Hardware<br/><br/>This year the Galaxy Tab S8 costs $50 more than its previous predecessor which is not bad considering some of the new features added. The Tab S8 is definitely not a cheap tablet, but it honestly offers a ton of awesome features that any student will appreciate who's in the market for a quality productivity-based tablet. I know some of you are debating whether you should get this or the iPad Air or Pro. And some of you are just looking for a quality android tablet for productivity and entertainment. Well, this video is for you all!<br/>When you look at the hardware of this device, it’s obvious that this thing is beautiful and there's definitely some iPad inspiration here. Anyway, On the back, you’ve got a matte aluminum finish with a glass magnet strip to connect the S Pen. On the right side is where you'll find the power button that doubles as a fingerprint scanner, the volume rockers which are tactile, and a micro SD card slot that can be expanded up to 1TB. On the left side are connectors for other accessories and on the bottom is a USB-C charging port that can charge up to 45W<br/><br/>Display<br/><br/>Flipping this device around, On the front, you’ve got an 11” 1600x2560 display. While the bezels on this device are slightly big for 2020, the display is still gorgeous and I love streaming content and playing games on its 120htz display. And the bigger bezels make it easier to hold on the hand without interfering with the view too much. In addition to being good for leisure, the display gets bright enough to read outside, so I could see this being used at any time of day, for just about anything you can imagine. I highly recommend a case or stand for this device because the edges are sharp and after long use, it's not comfortable to hold in the hand.<br/><br/>Battery<br/><br/>The 8000 mAh battery on here is also gonna make sure that this tablet goes all day. It's definitely not the best battery life I've experienced on a tablet, but it's certainly enough for long productivity sessions.  I typically get a full day of use on productivity days but when I add gaming or streaming to the mix, I do have to keep a portable charger with me.<br/><br/>Speakers<br/><br/>If you look around the sides, you’ll see four stereo speakers that get pretty loud and have clear audio quality, but you won’t see a headphone jack. Bummer. Anyway, this is probably one of the loudest speakers I've experienced on a tablet, so whether you're in a zoom meeting or listening to a lecture you won't have any trouble hearing.<br/><br/>Storage/Expandability<br/><br/>The base model of this device comes with 128GB and it’s an additional $80 for the 256GB model, and the S8 does come with a micro SD card slot, fortunately.<br/><br/>Cameras<br/><br/>The Galaxy Tab S8 has two cameras on the back, a 13mp wide-angle lens and a 6mp ultrawide lens. Photos and video are solid for a tablet, I was surprised to see that this ships with 4k at 60fps. The front camera has a 12mp 120-degree ultra-wide lens, which is great for zoom calls and conferences. It's sad that most laptops double or triple the price don't have nearly as good of a camera system compared to this device. Whether you're using it to scan documents or photography this is actually surprisingly solid.<br/><br/>Operating System and Performance<br/><br/>In terms of performance and the operating system, this ships with the new Snapdragon 8th gen Octa-Core processor, 8GB of RAM, and an Adreno 730 GPU running on Samsung’s version of Android 12. That’s really the most important reason to buy this tablet... it’s probably one of the most powerful tablets on the market. Like I mentioned before, entertainment is terrific, but this might be the best tablet for multi-tasking I’ve ever seen.<br/><br/>Samsung Dex<br/><br/>Samsung launched all their new tablets with a feature called Samsung DeX, that allows you to boot your tablet into a PC-like mode, where you can bounce between different windows of apps and move between screens easily.<br/>In the past, my biggest reason for recommending students pick up something like a Chromebook is because things like hooking your laptop up to external monitors, or multi-tasking through different windows were way easier on a Chromebook, but clearly, that's not the case anymore.<br/>Samsung also partnered with Microsoft to allow you to run excel, word, and other Microsoft apps in multiple desktop windows. So typing on this tablet is phenomenal when you hook up an external keyboard or just a keyboard case.<br/>This feature is really the best part of this tablet and honestly one of its biggest selling points.<br/><br/>S-Pen<br/><br/>In addition to DeX, is Samsung’s inclusion of the S-Pen in the box. Most students are taking notes digitally, so this is very much appreciated. There are times I honestly prefer this over the Apple pencil. I personally like how soft it feels on the screen and the paper sound it makes when you're taking notes. It's really cool that you can actually hover the s pen over certain things like the calendar to get more details without having to tap on the screen. I'd say the Apple price is slightly more accurate, but the s pen is definitely more innovative. The only thing I don't like is how it snaps to the tablet only in one orientation,  so essentially the tip has to be facing the camera for it to charge and for full magnetic power. Overall, Given how expensive adding the Apple Pen is to an iPad, I definitely think this is a great deal.<br/><br/>Price<br/><br/>And that takes me to the question you’ve been asking: is this worth the base-model, $700 price tag?<br/>I can confidently say the Galaxy Tab S8 is one of, if not the best, android tablets in its series.<br/>I think at $700 USD for the base model this is competing with the iPad Air and iPad Pro.<br/>If you absolutely know you want a tablet in this price range, I think you only go with the iPad if you want to use iMessage, sidecar, and other Apple-exclusive software features, and you go with the Tab S8 if you absolutely need a stylus and the best tablet experience on Android.</span>

<span>I actually traded in last year’s iPad 9 model for this one, not for the slightly greater speed, but because video conferencing is the thing now, and this new 10th gen iPad finally moves the camera to center-top when held sideways in landscape mode. Now people don’t feel I’m looking away from them, and they aren’t looking up my nose (Center Stage can only center us, not fix the view askance issue).<br/><br/>Ok 10.9” is definitely better than 10.2”, and if you are coming off an older (but still fast!) 9.7” model, you’re really in for a treat.<br/>And dual stereo speakers on left and right (sideways or landscape mode) sound louder, better, and natural instead of lopsided.<br/>Finally, improved rear camera.<br/><br/>Easiest way to scope all the changes is to search Wikipedia for iPad 10th generation.<br/><br/>Is it worth the price increase? Yes, due to the hedge against inflation and the additional hardware content: essentially 11” screen, Touch ID on power switch, A14 chip, dual stereo speakers, improved rear camera, USB C charging port allowing adapter-free, headache-free USB C thumddrives to move files (sometimes sneakernet is the best). Would I buy the $120 cheaper iPad 9, still a current model, for my kids instead? Tough call, the 10 is worth every extra dollar, but a budget is still a budget.<br/><br/>Why is this better for video conferencing than the Windows Surface Go and almost any Chromebook? Because Apple processors have the full capability video processing lacking in most Intel chips and in most budget ARM chips.  Sure they can all stream Amazon Prime, Netflix etc. but nothing at the iPad’s price - even the new price - can match its performance on far more demanding video conferencing.<br/><br/>Plus, battery life.<br/><br/>I tried out my kid’s school provided Chromebook on Zoom yesterday. Painful. Apple is much better, even the Macs now using the iPad derived chips. My budget Surface Go 3 tablet can’t compete, only my painfully expensive Surface Pro - which can’t match the battery life.<br/><br/>So there you go. Lotus 1-2-3 is no longer the killer app (think: 1980’s). It’s Zoom. The app practically screams out for an iPad with advanced ISP and this iPad 10 has something even the Pro iPads lack, a properly located front camera.</span>
