<span>I like everything about this except the storm warning function doesn’t really work right. It alarms during sunny days where no clouds can be seen however we had a tornado warning very close by a few days ago and it never made a peep. Lol. I still like it though.</span>

<span>***UPDATED***<br/><br/>First Review:<br/>I recently had a malfunction: the stopwatch function “froze” and I can’t reset or get out of the “time” mode.  I just checked and am beyond the Amazon return window (purchased in May, return window expired in June…it’s now late July).  I’ve read a ton of reviews that say the company doesn’t stand behind their product.  The jury is still out in my case so let’s see how they respond.  I’m not going to mention my occupationS or experience, that is reserved for review #2 after I see how they respond.  For the record, I also own an MC-2 Compass (made by the same company) and it’s world renowned, so I have high hopes they do the right thing.  We shall see, more to come.  July 23, 2022<br/><br/>Review #2 (September 18, 2022):<br/>It’s a good watch!  I’m in Law Enforcement (Highway Patrol &amp; Marine Unit), so I NEEDED a good watch.  This one is hard to read at night (small numbers/characters and low backlight brightness), the included “Quick Guide” (all FOUR of them) only tell a small part of the story of this watch.  To fully understand its capabilities and how to use it effectively, you’ll need that quick guide and all 33-pages of the user manual that you’ll have to download from their website.  When I said “and”, I literally mean you need them BOTH (photo attached) to understand how to use all of the functions because neither does an effective job explaining how the thing works!<br/><br/>I’m my first review I mentioned a malfunction.  Well, it ended up being operator error on my part because I literally didn’t understand that it had gone into locked mode AND I couldn’t see the teeny, tiny little padlock icon that said it was in locked mode!  Did I mention it’s hard to see/read?  That became even more challenging because I had accidentally changed the language to something other than English and what little chance I had to recover was totally gone once it changed to some other language.<br/><br/>If you wear glasses, be sure to use them whenever you’re setting or using anything other than the most basic functions (cycling through date, sunrise/sunset, stopwatch, timer, compass, altimeter, barometer).  The user interface isn’t user-friendly or even intuitive so prepare to start memorizing which buttons perform which function when you’re doing anything other than cycling through available menus.<br/><br/>Again, it’s a good watch…very good even!  I returned it for repair and they promptly returned it with the explanation that I didn’t know how to use it (those are my words, they were much more polite and professional…thanks to them for that!)<br/><br/>I was so frustrated when it was stuck in locked mode that I bought an Ironman (100m waterproof model) on-sale for $39.95.  I can actually read and manipulate its functions at night, without reading glasses and the buttons are ultra-intuitive!!!!  Sure it doesn’t have a compass, altimeter or barometer but for a basic rugged watch you can see (even at night without glasses or a magnifying glass), it’s kinda hard to beat since I swim often and waterproofing really matters.  This Suunto cost $125 on Amazon and it’s a better watch than the Ironman I just mentioned simply because of its highly advanced capabilities.  Just be prepared to do a ton of learning to use it effectively and efficiently in the field!<br/><br/>I give the Suunto Core All Black a solid 4-Stars for quality, aesthetics, capabilities, and durability.  The manual(s), display readability, and intuitive user interface all SUCK but I’m only going to dock them 1-Star for all of those because they should be easily correctable.  …it’s a very good watch!</span>

<span>I got my first Suunto Core as a gift in 2018. After somewhere around a year, it died &amp; replacing the battery did nothing. I contacted Suunto, they honored the warranty, I sent the dud watch back to them &amp; they sent me a new one. I'm still using it today (2022).<br/><br/>I LOVE the menu setup. It's by far the easiest non-smart watch to set &amp; navigate that I've ever seen. All of it's clock/timer functions work great, but none of it's other functions are very reliable.<br/><br/>On both my original &amp; the replacement, the altimeter is consistently off by anywhere from 20 meters to a KILOMETER, but averaging somewhere in the low 100 meter range. I've tried recalibrating many times. Doesn't seem to make a difference.<br/><br/>The compass was one of the biggest reasons I wanted this watch. An onboard, non-GPS compass was exactly what I was looking for because I enjoy camping &amp; hiking trips &amp; I was working toward a career in law enforcement. Unfortunately, the compass is consistently off by about 15 to 20 degrees. Again, I've tried recalibrating it many times. No change.<br/><br/>Also, as other reviewers have said, it goes through batteries entirely too fast. Since receiving my replacement watch in mid 2020, I have (in late 2022) already had to replace the battery 4 times.<br/><br/>Overall, I'm torn. If this was just a basic digital watch, I'd easily be giving it 5 stars, but because of it's failure to deliver it's other functions, I just can't justify that high of a rating.<br/><br/>Pros:<br/>excellent, user-friendly menu &amp; general opporation<br/>good clock &amp; timer functions<br/>durable design<br/><br/>Cons:<br/>inaccurate compass<br/>VERY inaccurate altimeter/barometer<br/>short battery life</span>

<span>This is my 6th GShock watch, and it's a fantastic value for the fitness app features, toughness, battery life (2+ years), etc. Perfect band fit and comfort for my 7'' wrist. Great visibility day/night. Auto-light for 6 hours is nice. Auto-syncs bluetooth w/phone (if in range) to update *time* every 6 hours, so it's technically more accurate than a Multiband 6 feature watch. Software is intuitive and compares to fitness smart watches I've owned. For comparison, the case diameter appears slightly smaller on my wrist than the GA2000 Carbon Core. Bluetooth connection was simple and fast. No glitches anywhere. Super easy to setup the watch from the gshock watch app, though having owned more than a dozen Casios it isn't difficult to navigate the features on the watch either. This is absolutely the best value GShock I've owned to date, and I'll be getting other colors.</span>

Super bad azz... Works as stated on POINT it was with in 2.6 meters on trac back.. Love the Plethora  of Manly features, watch faces that it has built in, not sure why you would need a third party FACE, Garmin has every one you would possibly need built in already, soooo NIce love it It is Miles even from the predecessors like the the cheaper plastic Garmins, don't get me wrong I have owned the lesser models from Garmin,  the solar Tactical in forest dark green, and the pixelated version solar, both were of Wow quality, but this "Tatix",  is woop azz.... Still way out priced,  I may add,  but at this point I am at a draw at the G price tag, it pretty much even does all the Montana 700I does, W T F really, yes on this amazing PIECE!!!!! I would say at 800 they would go like hot cakes on a cold Christmas morning.. And being in color,  WOW!!!</span>

<span>First off, I am a huge fan of Citizen Eco-Drive watches. I bought my first one in 2010 and it's still running to this day. I stopped using that one daily after the band broke down on me and I haven't gotten around to replacing it.<br/><br/>Fast forward to 2022 and I'm in need of another solid watch. I had been using an older Casio G-Shock after joining the military, but that started dying on me and the display only got more faint as time went on even after battery replacement. Then I got a cheaper Timex watch and the timing on it started to fall way behind after only about a month of use, up to an hour behind at times.<br/><br/>I had enough, so I looked at getting a new Citizen Eco-Drive watch. One that matched my uniform which is what I wear most of the week. I needed a watch that was easy to read at a glance, reliable, rugged enough for work, and accurate.<br/><br/>This watch hits all those marks. I haven't had a single problem with it since purchasing it and I've already taken it all over the place.<br/><br/>The only 2 downsides I can think of are:<br/><br/>1. The band it comes with isn't the greatest. It's definitely TOUGH, but it's a bit too stiff and a bit too short if you have larger wrists. I wouldn't say I do and it was still not an easy fit. I replaced the band with a Supreme NATO strap from Crown &amp; Buckle. 20mm band/strap fits the watch fine in my eyes regardless of what the specs say.<br/><br/>2. The hands don't glow as much as I'd like in the dark. Night shifts or later shifts can be rough when you're away from any lighting. Don't get me wrong, I can make out the time, but it takes longer than I'd like to because the hands aren't as bright. The only feature I miss from my G-Shock is the light up function. But overall, I'd trade that for not having to replace batteries ever again any day of the week. And I don't usually work nights or away from lighting, so it's something I can deal with.<br/><br/>In the end, if these features seem to suit you and your needs, definitely recommend this watch!</span>

<span>The main thing holding this watch back from greatness is the strap width. It is way too skinny for the size of the watch face, just really unporportional. The thickness of the watch itself is a bit much as well. Change those things, this watch is awesome.</span>

This new addition to the PRO TREK Multi-Field line come with a highly readable STN LCD that enhances readability. A silicon band provides a better fit to the wrist and the large rotary bezel creates a design that is bold, even for a PRO TREK model.

<span>It’s a decent watch and Amazons’ special pricing made it a no-brainer. The watch will receive the multi band 6 signal. And it’s comfortable to wear. It feels well built.<br/><br/>I do wish it was brighter because in daylight it can be a little hard to read, I usually wear it at an off angle (in between where you’d normally wear it and inside the wrist) while driving and that solves most of the issue.<br/><br/>I don’t need the ABC function nor the rotating bezel. I would rather have a digital GWG100. Solar/Atomic/ Rugged and digital.<br/><br/>I’ll use it as my daily watch.</span>

<span>This was over $300 when it first came out, I recently got it for just over $200. Mine came retail packaged with all the warranty, user guides, etc. Setting up is easy &amp; now that I have everything set to Auto except for power saving (I turned that off), in theory I should never have to touch it again in order for it to keep current time/date. It tries the first radio update after midnight...so far it's locked on first try every night. If you ever see this for under $200 you should buy one without question. I'll keep watching until it's phased out, you never know.</span>

<span>I've had this watch for about a year now.  Swimming, hunting, working on the boat, you name it.  I'm careful with it, but it's been wacked with tools and put through the test.  It still looks brand new and keeps the time.  I've also found that if it sits in a dark room for a couple days without me wearing it, no big deal.  The solar battery seems to hold a very long charge.  I've never had the watch stop telling accurate time.<br/><br/>Replace the strap with a Crown and Buckle NATO Strap.  The strap is bulky and uncomfortable.  Crown and Buckle makes an awesome NATO strap that is super high quality and worth an extra $15.</span>

The fit and finish are perfect and the watch has exceeded my expectations.  The Eco-Drive battery lasts for months unlike some automatics that stop before 24 hours.  The oxygen tank presentation box always caught my attention in jewelry stores.  Nice watch, don’t hesitate to buy especially when on sale.  All of the Promaster watches seem to be made very well.

<span>I’ve owned the basic 03E watch for 8 years and have just purchased the 05E chronowatch. The 03E is alive and well and I am only retiring it because I’ve recently discovered a chronograph is actually really handy for me at work. This review will be based on my experience with the 03E and I’ll assume everything’s true of both. If I later find that’s not the case, I’ll update my review.<br/><br/>This watch is a very practical, utilitarian, attractive watch. I’m 6’3”, 200 lbs, and not at all a fan of the large watch craze. This watch is the perfect size. It’s neither too small to be delicate looking (or feeling), nor large enough to be an eyesore or a weighty hunk of ballast on your arm. It’s weight rides comfortably and is easily ignored.<br/><br/>While many people complain about the band, once it broke in, the watch never tried to rotate around my wrist: it always sits squarely in the center of my wrist, even if I allow it to ride up and down my wrist. Never rolls in or away on me. The band looks like it’s going to fall apart at any moment after nearly a decade of abuse... but when you handle it, it gives no signs of fragility... I feel like I could get another eight years of wear out of the band.<br/><br/>The face has a few scratches, honestly earned over years of backpacking, woodworking, and army training. I went ahead and got a $10 scratch protector for the 05E— not that it needs it.<br/><br/>The 05E is visibly larger than the 03E when compared side by side, but otherwise their the practically the same size and weight when worn. The difference just will not be noticeable.<br/><br/>I noticed in photos from other reviews that the chrono hand (the large second hand) doesn’t come back to 12 when zeroed out; mine does the same. It’s visibly off to the left a bit. If that will bother you— it appears to be common to the model. It irks me, but I’ll get over it.<br/><br/>I tested the the chronograph against my Graf Zeppelin watch and my iPhone stopwatch and found no discernible variation between the three in an hour runtime.<br/><br/>The hands and dial are clearly visible for hours after dark (this is true of the 03E after 8 years too.)<br/><br/>These two watches are my second and third ecodrive— my first I would’ve purchased around 2004... it’s still ticking. I’ve never seen one stop. I make no conscious effort to expose them to day light, even leaving them in my bedroom for weeks and months and they never seem to slow down or quit. Ambient light in a dark room seems to be enough to keep them going. (This may not be true if you use the chronograph feature a lot.)</span>

<span>I like the simple design scheme that doesn’t bombard with other unnecessary data. You’ve got the watch, the chronograph, and then the 24 hour time indicator along with the date. It’s rugged, water resistant and has a sporty, expedition like appearance.<br/><br/>Misses:<br/>The date is difficult to read unless you bring the watch close to your face, making you feel like you’re older than you are. If you’re slender-wristed, the additional strap on the band will come off and there isn’t much of a point to it. You might want to cut that off actually. It would be nice to have an indicator as to how much battery is left since this is a solar powered watch.<br/><br/>Other than that it’s an accurate, useful, beautiful watch that I will be able buoy wearing for years to come.</span>

<span>This watch is very easy to read during both nightime and daytime. When I got it I thought the watch was dead because it had the wrong date and the red second hand did not work. And I saw another review stating how somone kept recieving dead watches. Fortunately, I just needed to learn how to use the watch. Turns out the watch is fine and it works wonderfully!<br/><br/>The red second hand is the second hand for the cronograph function. The second hand for the clock is the sundial just above the "6". This is my frist watch with a cronograph. I was unsure how to use it but figured it out and decided to explain it if you are also new to the watch world and this is your first cronograph. Click the bottom pusher to reset the cronograph and you will see the red second hand return to 0. The red second hand is just for the cronograph and functions independently of the second hand for the clock so no need to worry about messing up the time. The top pusher is to pause and resume the cronograph. The sundial at the "10" position records how much time (in minutes) is lapsed when using the cronograph. The sundial at the "2" position is not used for the cronograph, it is to tell you what hour of the day it is in military time which is pretty helpful to give you a visual of how much time you have before you go to bed or when work is done or whatever.<br/><br/>I was between this watch and the garrison. I chose this one because I wanted to have a cronograph watch to learn how to use it plus I liked the look of this one a little bit better. Like other reviews mentioned, I will likely get another band for it. The one it came with isn't as terrible as the other reviews make it out to be, but I am sure the watch would be complemented better by a different band.<br/><br/>Seriously do yourself a favor and buy this watch, I love it and will be keeping it on my wrist until it dies and then I will get another one.</span>

<span>I bought this watch for myself in 2010 when I joined the Air Force. It was used and abused daily for years and through every kind of training, two months of combat advisor training and 12 months deployed in Helmand province, Afghanistan. The watch was 12 years old when I had to replace the capacitor for 80 bucks, which is absolutely cheap. This thing has so much sentimental value to me and is a tank, you cannot lose with this. If my house caught fire I would save this watch before my $5400 Omega Seamaster 300 Professional.</span>
