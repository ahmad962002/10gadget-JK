                   <h4> What People Say:</h4>
<div class="slideshow-container">
<blockquote><em><div class="a-row a-spacing-small review-data"><span class="a-size-base review-text review-text-content" data-hook="review-body">
<span>Overall<br/><br/>Let me preface this review by saying this is my first real big boy watch. I did buy a Tissot which did not work out. I did countless hours of research before settling on this watch. What initially attracted me to this was the very smooth sweeping second hand. I assure you after about 6 months of constant wear as a "beater", the movement appears to be holding true to the accuracy claim. I measured the accuracy against time.gov. The second hand is cruising smooth and cool. It has kept perfect time for me without gaining or losing so much as a second. I just adjusted it for daylight savings and I trust it can be relied upon for accuracy year round.<br/><br/>The overall presentation of the watch is stellar. The watch is big and serious. As an engineer, this watch tells people to calm the heck down because I know what I am talking about. The heavy steel bracelet and case have remained looking great even while collecting some dings and scratches. The bracelet is strong and the clasp is sturdy, albeit scratched. However, The 4 hex case screws and the space between the bezel and the case tend to collect a lot of grime and are difficult to clean. My arms are more muscular than average and I think this big monster helps accentuate my physique.<br/><br/>I have conked my wife with this thing and the hex screws have scraped her. Sometimes it's hard to find a comfortable position at night with this on my wrist. This beast is no joke.<br/><br/>The Window<br/><br/>I was worried that the non-sapphire window would scratch. This has not happened at all and the window is 100% free of scratches. However the window is curved and can make the face difficult to see at non-direct angles because the image of the face becomes warped. The window is also very reflective, which I personally find to be the greatest drawback of this watch from a presentation perspective, and because of the curve, I often am blasted with reflected ceiling lighting or sun before finding the right angle for viewing the face.<br/><br/>The Face<br/><br/>If you are bothering to read this, I do not need to sell you on the face of the watch. It looks exceptional. However I will warn you about a couple things. The luminescence is quite weak and the watch is difficult to read in darkness. Tragically, the minutes gauge on the chrono is too cluttered and small to read effectively. The small minutes gauge might be a deal breaker for real chronograph users because the minute gauge is a pretty important gauge. It would have been more useful to swap the placement of the 1/1000 gauge with the minute gauge when this watch was designed. I was hoping to be able to make more use out of the chronograph but due to the tiny minute gauge, I have not used the chronograph very much.<br/><br/>The Chronograph<br/><br/>The Chrono is fun to use. The buttons feel sturdy and everything functions. When starting the chrono, the second hand moves quickly into the 12 o clock position and then ticks (rather than sweeps) steadily. When stopping the chrono, the second hand resumes measuring real-world time. Cool! It is possible to pause and resume a chrono measurement.<br/><br/>There is a gauge for measuring to the tenth and hundredth of a second which seems to be (sadly) a tad slow but I have not attempted to measure/calibrate it in any scientific way. Also, the 1/10 and 1/100 gauge stops moving after 30 seconds but provides a readout after the chono is stopped. For the first 30 seconds and for 30 seconds after resuming a chronograph measurement I am mesmerized by those tiny hands whirring around with high accuracy at such an incredible rate.<br/><br/>The 1/1000 gauge does not move until the chronograph is stopped. So, it supposedly provides a final reading of the measurement to the precision of one one-thousandth of a second. The 1/1000 gauge is fun, but get real, there is no way anyone would ever use this or check it for accuracy without a robot. The human reaction time needed to depress the stop/start button totally negates any real usefulness of the 1/1000 gauge (or even 1/100 for that matter). I seriously question the 1/1000 gauge accuracy and challenge it's prominent placement on the face. Still, 1/1000 is kinda neat.<br/><br/>The crown/water resistance<br/><br/>Adjusting the time and date feels crisp and satisfying, both via the crown. There appears to be no issue with leakage or water submersion. I have not taken the watch diving, but showering and swimming is not a problem.<br/><br/>Thanks<br/><br/>I have enjoyed wearing this watch over the past 6 months. I hope the details of this review help someone make a decision one way or the other on this watch. I am afraid I have been bitten by the horology bug. I will be transitioning to a much different watch for a while... a Marathon GSAR automatic.</span>

<span>I bought this watch years ago as a gift for my son. I was impressed with the style, look, and accuracy. When I saw it on Amazon for half of what I paid for the original one I couldn’t resist buying one for myself. I own the Versace Palazzo, a Tag Heuer, and a Movado Bold, but by far this is my favorite everyday watch because it doesn’t get scuffed as easily as they do. It’s a hell of a look for a very reasonable price</span>

<blockquote><em><div class="a-row a-spacing-small review-data"><span class="a-size-base review-text review-text-content" data-hook="review-body">
<span>I really want to love this watch, actually I do, but the only issue I have is that the hour and minute hands are hard to see, even when your looking straight at it. The watch itself is beautiful and very bulky. I like that in a watch. So it’s more jewelry than a timepiece.</span>

Bulova made space history on August 2, 1971--during the Apollo 15 mission, a moon pilot chronograph, customized for lunar conditions by Bulova engineers, was worn on the moon. Now Bulova makes history again with the special edition Lunar Pilot Chronograph, updated with our exclusive high performance quartz movement with a frequency of 262 kHz for unparalleled accuracy, continuing a history of precision timing.   From the Precisionist Collection. Featuring Bulova’s proprietary Precisionist accuracy, this advanced chronograph offers 1/1,000-second precision over a twelve-hour time frame, with accuracy to within seconds a year. In stainless steel with curved crystal, multiple-layer black carbon fiber, blue, silver and black dial, chronograph measurement of hours, minutes, seconds, 1/10-seconds, 1/100-seconds and 1/1,000-seconds, yellow continuously sweeping second hand, luminous hour and minute hands, luminous markers, tachymeter, calendar, screw-back case, screw-down crown, double-press fold-over clasp with safety lock, and water resistance to 300 meters.Providing an extraordinary level of timing accuracy, the Bulova Precisionist Chronograph is the only chronograph to combine stopwatch timing to 1/1,000-second with Bulova’s exclusive Precisionist-class torsional resonator movement, proven in laboratory testing to be one of the world’s most accurate.Easy and logical to read, each style features four subdials to display the cumulative time at a single glance, with individual measurements on the combined 1/10- and 1/100-second counter, as well as the hour and minute dials, dual-duty floating second hand, and a distinctive 1/1,000-second track with retrograde indicator.Precisionist TechnologyAt the heart of the watch is the Bulova Precisionist-class torsional resonator movement, custom-engineered to provide accuracy to within seconds a year using a three-prong quartz crystal that creates a vibration frequency of 262.144 kHz, the highest of any watch in the world and far greater than that of a standard quartz crystal. In laboratory testing, the Precisionist-class movement has been shown to be three times more accurate than standard quartz. This proprietary manufactured movement, including the signature floating second hand, also offers a resistance to gravitational error that makes it superior in performance to any mechanical watch on the market.Summary of FeaturesPrecision timing to 1/1,000th of a second12-hour chronograph functionOne of the world’s most accurate movements – accurate to within seconds a yearPrecisionist-class torsional resonator movement proven in laboratory testing to be three times more accurate than standard quartzStainless steel case and braceletCurved mineral crystalMultiple-layer black carbon fiber, blue and silver dialYellow continuously sweeping second handLuminous hour and minute handsLuminous markersCalendar windowTachymeterScrew-backScrew-down crownWater resistant to 300 metersAbout BulovaIn 1875, Joseph Bulova, a 23-year-old immigrant, set up shop in New York City and a legendary American watch brand was born. Since then, Bulova has stood proudly in the vanguard of timekeeping innovation, committed to the legacy of creativity and excellence established by its founder.A pioneering force in the industry, Bulova transformed how watches were worn and how time was perceived, registering over 50 patents as he and his company built a record of creativity including the first full lines of men’s (1919) and ladies’ (1924) wristwatches, the first clock/radio (1928) and the first electric clock (1931). To ensure the utmost in precision, in 1920, Bulova even established its own observatory – located atop its New York skyscraper. With that same spirit of innovation, following World War II, determined “to serve those who served us,” Bulova established The Bulova School of Watchmaking, using new and unique methods to train disabled veterans for positions in the watch and jewelry industry. Then, in 1960, Bulova changed timekeeping forever with the revolutionary Accutron, the world’s first fully electronic watch. An integral component of U.S. space technology, Accutron timing was used on 46 NASA missions, including Apollo XI, the first lunar landing (1969).Today, as one of the world’s most recognized brands, Bulova has expanded across the globe, with four separate watch brands, Bulova, Bulova AccuSwiss, Bulova Accutron II and Caravelle New York, as well as the award-winning Bulova Clocks.The signature Bulova brand provides an extensive selection of watches for every occasion, crafted of the finest materials, including 315L surgical grade stainless steel, diamonds, mother-of-pearl, carbon fiber, top-quality leather and Bulova’s proprietary Duramic nylon/ceramic composite, and powered by Precisionist-class quartz, automatic and quartz movements. An industry leader in diamond watch styling, with the new Diamond Gallery offering exquisite designs in stainless steel with sapphire crystals, Bulova is also known for Precisionist, featuring Bulova’s proprietary Precisionist-class quartz torsional resonator movement for accuracy to within seconds per year, the Marine Star collection, combining high-performance sports timekeeping with superior durability and water resistance to a minimum of 100 meters, and a comprehensive selection of classic styles, each with a three-year limited warranty.  
  From the UHF Collection. Taking inspiration from astronaut Dave Scott's personal Bulova chronograph worn during the Apollo 15 moon landing. Six hand calendar chronograph, stainless steel screw-back case in silver-tone finish and black dial, sapphire glass, interchangeable black leather and nylon straps with three-piece buckle closure, and water resistance to 50 meters. Powered by Bulova's proprietary, high-performance UHF quartz movement, with a vibrational frequency of 262kHz-eight times greater than a standard quartz movement for unparalleled accuracy. Diameter: 45mm Thickness: 13.5mm. The maximum chrono reading is 60 minutes   See more

<blockquote><em><div class="a-row a-spacing-small review-data"><span class="a-size-base review-text review-text-content" data-hook="review-body">
<span>This watch has been reviewed on Amazon many times already, so I will try to not repeat too much of what has already been said, and if I do repeat, I'll try to condense my words to what you might really be interested to know.<br/><br/>First: This watch has some historical significance, as a replica of the only other watch known to be worn on the Moon besides the Omega Speedmaster (which I also once owned). Bulova produced just a few of these back in the early 70's (through their Swiss subsidiary Universal Geneve), submitted some to NASA for testing, and gifted one to David Scott, who took it along as "backup" during the Apollo 15 mission. He ended up wearing it on the lunar surface while piloting the Lunar Rover. That particular watch sold at auction in 2015 for $1,600,000.<br/><br/>Second: Even without the historical significance, it's a technically interesting watch with unique features. The watch uses Bulova's UHF quartz movement, in which the crystal vibrates 8 times faster than conventional quartz watches. This provides extreme accuracy of approximately 10 seconds/year as well as very smooth motion of the central chronograph seconds hand. The running seconds hand located on the subdial at six o'clock ticks every half-second, not every second like most quartz watches.<br/><br/>Third: The styling is unique among modern Bulova watches, which are often very highly polished, glittery and sometimes "blingy". This watch is more of a "tool" or instrument, with a mostly bead blasted texture, and a little bit of a brushed finish on the bezel. The crystal is a thick flat slab of sapphire, and actually protrudes a millimeter or so above the edge of the bezel, just like the original plexiglass crystal did. The pushers to activate the chronograph functions are levers which operate in slots milled in the case. The dial is very precisely detailed, and has the subdials and the track for seconds recessed slightly below the level of the main dial, while the tachymeter track is raised above the main dial, giving a pleasing three-dimensional effect. The white lumed hands and markers offer high contrast with the black dial, and very good legibility. Basically, the watch looks like something designed to do a particular job, rather than something designed simply to look pretty.<br/><br/>Fourth: The watch is physically large. The original was 43.3 mm diameter, and because the UHF movement used requires slightly more space, the case has been slightly enlarged to 45 mm, with an overall length of 53 from lug-to-lug and about 13 mm thickness. For most people, this isn't really a problem as large watches are fashionable, and it's not stupidly large like some other examples I could name. My wrists are almost exactly 7 inches, and I already owned other watches with similar size, so from my perspective it looks large, but not TOO large. If your wrists are less than 7 inches circumference, the watch MAY look big on you, depending on your personal preferences.<br/><br/>Fifth: The build quality is excellent. I could find no defects at all, everything worked properly out of the box. I've heard of some buyers needing to reset the chronograph hands to zero (an easy adjustment), mine were fine from the start. The back is nicely detailed with information about the Apollo 15 mission and the famous Bulova tuning fork logo. The presentation box includes an extra velcro strap similar to those actually used by NASA, as well as a tool to remove the spring bars when changing straps. The leather strap which is attached to the watch is very nice, with a texture which resembles either carbon fiber or a basketweave (take your pick). Either way, it is kind of stiff to begin with, but in a day or so, conforms very well to my wrist. I find it comfortable enough to wear while sleeping, and although the watch is somewhat heavy, after a while it is easy to forget I'm wearing it. I wouldn't choose this watch to wear during very active sports such as mountain biking, as the weight on my wrist might be noticeable then. Also, I've got other watches which are lighter and better suited for that kind of use. However, for everyday wear, the Lunar Pilot is perfectly comfortable.<br/><br/>Bottom line (see what I did there?) is that this watch is unique, comfortable, accurate and historically significant, and a LOT of watch for the money.</span>

<span>Beautiful timepiece at a great price. The angles are sleek. The movement is hypnotizing. The Minimalistic simplicity of the face is perfectly juxtaposed by the gears behind it. I find watches with too many dials and tick marks to be excessive and gaudy. The combination of matte and polished metal creates a perfect daily driver that can be dressed up or down. I am very satisfied with this purchase. One pro I didn’t see mentioned is the crown placement. Having it off center helps keeping it from pinching you when you flex your wrist. Very big pro if you have small wrists.<br/><br/>There are 3 bad reviews at the time which should be ignored. Two don’t understand that a mechanical watch must be wound to keep time, and the third doesn’t realize you can manually wind it to keep it ticking overnight if your arm movements during the day were inadequate.<br/><br/>There are a few valid complaints, but they are by no means deal-breakers. The hands are a little hard to find sometimes, but you’ll easily get used to looking for the glow-in-the-dark white lines. The second hand seems to move erratically at times, but overall keeps time well. A date dial would be nice, but I am not a fan of having to manually set the date after non-31-day months, and you’ll be hard pressed to find a mechanical watch with a perpetual calendar at this price point.</span>

<span>This is honestly the best sub-$300 watch you'll find. I have many watches, some more expensive than this bulova, but this watch remains my favorite for two reasons. The first being the physical appearance of the watch. The amazon pictures definitely dont do it justice, as it is a much more amazing looking watch in-person. Unless you have freakishly tiny wrists (under 6 inches), the watch looks super nice with any outfit, and despite having a pretty large face, it doesnt look gaudy at all. However, if your wrists are smaller than 6 inches, I'd advise against getting this watch. It will literally be wider than your wrist.<br/><br/>The second reason I love this watch is the movement. It's a solid automatic that I can leave in my display case for multiple nights without losing time! I've only had to wind my watch once, and that was the day it arrived. Even some of my more expensive timepieces will lose time faster than this Bulova.<br/><br/>Overall a great watch at a great price.</span>

<span>The watch itself is really nice, the band seems cheaper than the case. My chronometer second hand is a little askew of the zero which was a bummer. The watch resembles a high quality Omega Speedmaster and succeeds in appearing very nicely polished and fashionable. The band isn’t as bad as other reviews mentioned, just doesn’t seem to “match” the case in terms of shinyness. Overall I am happy with it, just really wish my chronometer second hand wasn’t slightly askew of the zero marker.</span>

<span>This was my first Bulova watch, but certainly won't be my last!<br/><br/>Design:<br/>This thing is beautiful, like, drop dead gorgeous. The smoke-gray dial and gold indexes are an unusual color choice that you don't see on many watches, but it works surprisingly well. This is also one of the few watches to do open-heart correctly, by centering it at 6 and keeping the rest of the dial simple so as not to distract from the heart itself!<br/><br/>Construction:<br/>The movement is obviously good quality being Bulova, and the case is well constructed. I would have really liked to see a sapphire crystal, but $300 seems to be about the break point where some watches decide to upgrade to sapphire and some don't, so it's understandable. At $500+ yeah I would absolutely demand sapphire and nothing less, but a $300 watch can go either way.<br/><br/>Strap:<br/>It's wearable, but obviously in this price range, the strap is the first item on the cost cutting list, so don't expect ultra luxury. Thankfully though straps are easy to replace, so just buy one of  you own if you really want.</span>

<span> So my husband's favorite watch was his Bulova, it's silver with black accents; and crystals of course. So I found that watch's twin in this watch! Certain aspects of this watch are even nicer, ah hem, the crystal face for example! Needless to say this is his new favorite watch! He said this one is for when he wants to show off his jewelry and the Armani Exchange I bought him last year is for most other days.... This Bulova is fancy and glistens like crazy in the sun.<br/><br/>The directions to set the time, date, and day of the week; are all online at the Bulova website, which is provided with the watch.<br/>The watch arrives pretty large,<br/>it has plenty of room for men with larger wrists. It's also adjustable (professionally unless you have the device, like hubby does) so links can be removed for the perfect fit. He said it came with half links too! Delivery was fast and on time. Watch arrives in an original Bulova box with a cardboard wrap on four sides. The exterior is very giftable, as is the interior. I opened my husband's upon receipt, to ensure everything was nicely placed, asthetically pleasing, and to tuck the tags out of the way so it would be shown in the perfect position 😀 it was,  he loves it!<br/>Ladies if you're contemplating, just do it already! He'll love it! It's Bulova! The price point is perfect! No reason not to!</span>

<span>This watch is better looking in real life. For those panicking about the lack of the "tuning fork" logo on the watch face relax. Bulova was kind enough to put the fork on the crown and the rotor. There is also a brand label on the inside of the watch band itself so this is a legit Bulova. I have gotten several compliments on the way it looks and it's quickly moving up my list of my favorite watches I own. The band is a little stiff but that's to be expected with a new leather band so no shocker there. The clasp may confuse some people but it's not a downfall of the watch at all. The clasp comes apart in two sections. There are two sets of releases you must press (one of each side of the clasp) that will fully release the clasp. Then use common sense to snap it back together. It is a bit tricky to get the tail end of the band through the loops as you are clipping it together but you'll be a freaking pro after a couple times. To release the buckle to adjust the strap you simply pull the top part of the buckle up (opposite side of the hinge) and adjust to your size. I have noticed that on my wrist I am in between the factory holes but that problem was fixed by making my own hole which you can't see under the buckle. If you are a savy Amazoner, watch this watch for when the price drops. I bagged this baby for $135 and I see that it's over two bills now. You will not be disappointed in this watch and if you are, your standards are too damn high for watch shopping on Amazon and you need to take a long hard look in the mirror.</span>

<span>I am a watch lover and own a lot of Japanese, swiss and American brands- both the conventional and the smart watches. This Bulova watch is by far one of my most favorite and everyday goto office watch for the last 2 years because of the following (PROS):<br/>1. EXTREMELY good looking neutral color watch- goes with formals, suits, casual wear… this watch is a sweet blend of dress watch, semi-casual and casual watch<br/>2. Being an aerospace engineer I like the fact that this watch has a false composite looking dial- I think it looks more futuristic than than a shiny metal face<br/>3. ECO DRIVE (charges in minimal passive light)- I cannot tell how difficult it is for me to remember to charge my smartwatches, and change batteries once in a while. Eco drive pushes the limit of engineering. Takes it a step further with no hassle of batteries, charging<br/>4. Build quality is extremely good- I wear this sometimes while doing exercise, in the shopfloors and had no issues with small bangs, sudden vibration<br/>5. I personally think it looks better with the Bulova logo not on the watch face- gives more real estate on watch face<br/>6. The knob dials are big, responsive and have a very good grip even with sweaty or moist fingers.<br/>7. The thickness and diameter of the bezel fits absolutely well with my relatively narrow wrist<br/>CONS:<br/>1. The leather band is not the best quality – I had to replace my band after 9 months of use (switched to neoprene all weather bands)<br/>2. The watch glass though hardened, started to show scratches after like 6 months of very gentle and careful use….<br/><br/>Would recommend anyday!!</span>

<span>I'm admittedly a fan of Bulova watches.  For a mid-range watch company, the quality they put out is always impressive, and this watch is no different.<br/><br/>A few things to note....<br/><br/>It is an AUTOMATIC watch....which means no batteries, but it does require constant moving to keep running.  If you're not going to wear it every day, you will either need to wind it daily, reset the time each time you wear it, or, like I did for my automatic watches, buy a watch case designed for these types of watches that spins them while you're not wearing to keep them charged.  Personally, I like the latter option, as it also looks impressive to have your nicest watches on display, while spinning and catching light.<br/><br/>I really like the look of the face.  The blue numerals are highly polished, catch light nicely, and even seen to "glow" or change shades in the right light (see pictures)<br/><br/>Second, at 44mm, it's a medium size Bulova watch, so don't expect a massive watch face and case like an Invicta or even a larger Bulova.  Keeping in line with the medium size face, the case thickness is also slightly on the thin side, so keep that in mind.<br/><br/>Lastly, I really like the band, it is one of the "continuous" styles where there isn't really a bottom clasp.  It double links together underneath making the outside of the band seamless (see picture). One thing however...while links are easily removed, unlike some bands, there is no "micro adjust" feature to really nail the fit (I'm talking about bands that have the spring loaded pin that can be depressed and moved between 3 different holes, each about 1/3 the size of a link), so you'll have to make do with the best fit based on how many links you remove.<br/><br/>Overall, for the price, the look and quality is certainly there, and I finally found a white faced Bulova to add to my collection.</span>

<span>Bulova is a beloved, old school American watch brand for a reason. And this watch does not disappoint. It’s utilitarian vintage style with a nice light ivory face and military time, makes this field watch a must own classic. The domed crystal really brings it up a notch; a quality that makes this watch classier than many other standard field style watches you see on the market. Fittings are brushed stainless with a polished finish which gives it a higher end industrial feel. The lum is good and bright and the time has been accurate to within a few seconds per day. An added touch of class, the sweep second hand sets this apart from the average Seiko or Timex of similar style. Some reviewers haven’t been a fan of the band, but I actually love it and feel it suits this watch perfectly. It’s soft leather in a nato style with fittings that match the case. Speaking of the case, it’s really the grail size at 38mm which makes it large enough to read, without being fashion watch trendy. It’s a field watch so expect it to be thicker than a dress watch. But it’s light weight and not clunky to wear. All in all, this will be on my wrist more often than some of the other more expensive watches in my rotation. It’s an absolute classic, simple, elegant and timeless. Seller was quick and shipped to my current remote location via FedEx. You can’t go wrong with the Bulova Hack as this is a really great watch for the money.<br/><br/>UPDATE<br/>Still like the leather band although it is soft and has stretched a bit, which is to be expected. I’ll end up swapping it out for something a bit more sturdy.</span>

<span>If you want a time-only watch and like this look, there is literally nothing to complain about here.<br/><br/>Accuracy is going to be a mixed bad but if I recall, for me it's better than +/- 10 seconds a day, which is more than anyone deserves for a mechanical watch at this price.<br/><br/>The crown feels good (surprisingly) and the hands feel solid as you move them around the dial.<br/><br/>I wouldn't mind the watch being larger at maybe 40 mil.<br/><br/>The strap is crap, which is what you can always expect at this price range. I bought a "Halveston" vintage canvas NATO, and it looks gorgeous.<br/><br/>There probably isn't a cheaper way to get into a watch that was issued for military forces. While now owned by Citizen (An excellent Japanese watchmaker), the history of a watch doesn't change based on its current ownership.</span>
