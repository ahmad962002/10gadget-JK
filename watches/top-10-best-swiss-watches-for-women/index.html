As the name indicates, this watch will be the winner everytime, for any occasion. A classical, timeless design, the sleek and clean face of the Tissot Everytime singles it out as a very modern watch. The cool minimalism of the face leaves room for some fun experimentation with the bracelet.

The Tissot Lady Hearts are filled with feminine charm, inside and out. The inner beauty, a fine automatic movement is visible through a window on the lovely dial at the magical hour of twelve. Femininity finds further expression through details such as a mother of pearl dial and diamond stud.

<span>I have have always liked the Omega Seamaster with the Blue face but it is not my budget.  I like the Bulova Precisionist  line and also love G-Steel Casio G Shock watches, but this will be my most expensive watch to date if I had paid the $750 full price.<br/>The Omega Semaster caught my eye a few years ago, and I have always liked watches with a blue face since seeing the older TAG Kirium. I am getting ready to retire in a few years so I thought I wanted to get myself a nice watch since it might be my last one and I wanted a Swiss watch. Since I really love the ruggedness and durabilty of the Casio G Shock G Steel line, this watch got my attention. If you are looking for a handsome medium priced Dive watch or just like the diver watch style,  this may be your watch. Did I mention how seriously rugged this watch is, If you get a chance go to the Victorinox site and check out the tests that they subjected this watch to, I think you will be impressed! If you are a G Shock fan like myself and you are willing to pay a little more money, you owe it to yourself to check this watch out. This is a beautiful watch that can easily transition from Power Boat to power meetings.<br/> In reference to my comment about paying a little more than the G Shock line, I am talking the metal G- Steel G-Shocks which are upwards of $500 now.</span>

<span>This watch is gorgeous! I'm so relieved that it's the perfect size too. Some of the Movado Bold watches are huge, almost gawdy big. Not true for this one. I did my homework and settled on this size. It actually looks bigger in the pic. I was nervous because there were no pictures or proper reviews. So incredibly glad I got this one! I'll have to take it to my local jeweler to have a link or two taken out but that's a given. I am beyond satisfied and would highly recommend this watch. Packaged beautifully and arrived in two days. Just in time for Mother's Day. Treat yourself ladies, you won't regret this purchase.<br/><br/>Update: Took it to my local jeweler and he guaranteed it's authenticity. Also removed two links while I waited. Such a great watch</span>

For more than 150 years, Tissot has embodied the innovation and tradition of Swiss watch-making. Based in the Neuchâtel area of the Jura Mountains, in Le Locle, Switzerland, Charles-Félicien Tissot and his son Charles-Emile created the watch making company Tissot in 1853. Whether in the technology of its movements, in the research for special materials or in the very functions of the watch itself, Tissot's engineers and watchmakers have developed pioneering timepieces over the years.  Some of Tissot's triumphs over the years include the the Idea 2001 (the world's first plastic watch) released in 1971, the Rock watch (which set the timepiece's movement in a stone case made from Swiss Alps granite) in 1985, and the Wood watch from 1988 (with a completely wooden case). Tissot uses the best movements (from ETA SA Manufacture Horlogère Suisse), the highest quality materials (316L steel, 18K gold, titanium) and scratch-proof glasses (sapphire crystal--at least 2500 Vickers).  The company has been involved with high profile sports events since 1974 when they sponsored a racing car in the 24 Hours of Le Mans, France. Since then Tissot's timepieces have been chosen as official timekeepers for world championships in cycling, motorcycling, fencing and ice hockey. And Tissot is currently the the official watch and timekeeper of NASCAR.  Tissot timepieces have been worn by a bevy of celebrities over the years--including Grace Kelly, Elvis Presley and Nelson Mandela--and James Stewart's character L.B. Jefferies wore a Tissot timepiece in Alfred Hitchcock's "Rear Window." Today the company is represented in a variety of sporting fields by English soccer star Michael Owen, IndyCar driver Danica Patrick, and MotoGP world champion Nicky Hayden. Today, Tissot is a member of the Swatch Group, the world's largest watch producer and distributor.  Stainless steel case with a two-tone (silver and gold PVD) stainless steel bracelet. Fixed two-tone (silver and gold PVD) bezel. White dial with black hands and Roman numeral hour markers.

<span>Beautiful watch, my wife loved it.<br/>Fast forward to February, 2022, and it stopped running. Easy fix, replace the battery. Hmm, must be an old battery, it still wouldn't run. Bought new batteries, replaced the "old" new battery with a just purchased battery and it still wouldn't run. As far as I know there's no further troubleshooting a quartz movement. It's now a nice looking decoration that doesn't work. Very disappointed. I thought Tissot was a good brand.</span>

<span>Just after 2 year warranty expired,  the watch stopped working properly.  It would stop running, then I would re set it and it would be just fine for a couple of weeks. Then it would stop running again.  I re set it and it would run properly for a week.  And so on.  I contacted Watch Savings a  couple of times.  First they said it needed to be de magnetized.  I brought the watch into a local repair shop, and they said that that was not the issue, but they de magnetized it anyway.  And they also changed the battery as well.  Still having the same problem.  I sent 2 emails to Watch Savings asking them to accommodate me by exchanging the watch. I would be a good thing to do.  My e mails went ignored.  Not the customer service I was expecting.  I am going to try calling again.  As of now, I would not buy a watch from a 3rd party seller.  Amazon would not help either.</span>
