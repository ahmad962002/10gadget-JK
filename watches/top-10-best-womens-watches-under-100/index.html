<blockquote><em><div class="a-row a-spacing-small review-data"><span class="a-size-base review-text review-text-content" data-hook="review-body">
<span>I like this watch because it is casual and not real bulky. I can dress it up a little with a bracelet if I want it to be a little dressier.</span>

<blockquote><em><div class="a-row a-spacing-small review-data"><span class="a-size-base review-text review-text-content" data-hook="review-body">
<span>brand and wanted to buy from USA cosndiering quality product but found 1 daimand  already detached<br/> and stuck within the watch at a corner.Also i m back to indai wuth the product so cant return or replace any other option please suggest</span>

<p> </p>
<blockquote><em><div class="a-row a-spacing-small review-data"><span class="a-size-base review-text review-text-content" data-hook="review-body">
<span>I love the watch, but the clasp won’t stay closed, it pops open anytime anywhere, I’m afraid I’m going to lose it! It will cost me $35.00 to send it back to Fossil to get it repaired, half of what I paid for it,</span>
</span></div></em></blockquote>
<p> </p>
<blockquote><em><div class="a-row a-spacing-small review-data"><span class="a-size-base review-text review-text-content" data-hook="review-body">
<span>Such a pretty watch. Five months after buying, it broke while I was at church. It simply fell off my arm, as though the resin / ceramic part (whatever it is) just gave way. I take great care of my things, and I've worn this watch only a handful of times, so this was disappointing. Manufacturer's warranty doesn't cover the band. So, if you're needing a cute watch for just a few months, go with this one. If you want to invest in something that will last longer, maybe choose a different style. It's only a matter of time before the resin falters. Good luck!</span>

I have to admit that I’m not smart enough to figure out what it does or how to setup &amp; use, but I just need to go to the Fossil site &amp; read the instructions. It does bother me that you have to go online just to learn about a product but I know that they’re probably trying to be eco friendly, but I suspect it’s a lot cheaper not to include a booklet.<br/>The one complaint I do have is that this watch has a very thick casing &amp; I have to remember to be mindful about bashing it on things while I’m wearing it.<br/>Overall I love this watch &amp; will undoubtedly like even more when I figure out how to use the smart features.<br/>You can’t go wrong with Fossil products &amp; this is just another example of their wonderful designs.<br/>I recommend this watch for anyone who likes quality watches at a fairly affordable price.</span>

The direct descendant of our 1960s televised torture test survivors, today's Easy Reader is as durable as it is classically cool.   Fashionable for any occasion, the Timex T2H331 silver-tone stainless steel watch features an easily readable dial with mid Arabic numeral display against a classic white dial background. It offers a mid-sized, round watch case with slightly raised bezel and a supple, genuine leather strap in black. It also features water resistance to 30 meters (99 feet), and date display at 3 o'clock. With the Quick Date function, you can set the date on the watch without turning the crown for every 24-hour period. Just pull the stem halfway out, and turn until desired date is reached. The Indiglo night-light uniformly lights the surface of the watch dial using patented blue electroluminescent lighting technology. It uses less battery power than most other watch illumination systems, enabling your watch battery to last longer.

Easy to turn off or reactivate.<br/>-Has "forward" and "backward" setting buttons -- a great time saver when you overshoot.<br/>-One-button seconds sync, and it applies to all 3 time zones.<br/>-Stopwatch (I rarely use the laps feature).<br/>-Count down timer, with configurable one-time, or auto-restart.<br/>I wish they would make it more robust. The first Timex I bought, the strap broke after just a few years. The previous one, the start button got sticky and would "bounce"; and some bug or suntan spray got on the lens and left permanent drop marks.</span>

<span>I just needed a new watch. I don't plan to use this to count laps, use it as a timer, or use it as an alarm and certainly I won't be swimming with it. It's nice to know I CAN use these functions but at 68 with bad legs, I more then likely won't. I needed a new watch at a reasonable price and decided on this. I trust Timex products.</span>

<span>This watch has been awesome! I’ve ordered and worn quite a few watches online and a lot of them break pretty quickly or don’t do what they’re advertised to do. This one is my favorite yet–you should get this one. I love the leather, the minimalist, almost nautical design, how the leather strap doubles up under the watch face, and how the clasps are metal instead of plastic or leather. When I got it, there was one stitch that stuck out and would rub my wrist wrong, so that’s my one regret, but honestly, I don’t even notice it anymore. I ended up setting it to match the bell tower on my college’s campus, and it’s always fun to hear the bell and look down to see, as always, my watch exactly ticking the hour. I haven’t taken it diving or anything, so I don’t really know how it fairs underwater, but I leave it on to wash my hands and things and it’s been totally fine. That and the fact that it lights up (not super bright, but just enough that you can see) makes it super awesome. This watch has been great, and if I ever need a new one, I’ll probably buy this same one again.</span>

<span>I have owned 4 different Timex watches. I am old and each and every one died on me after at least 8-12 years......The commercial in college used to say "Takes a lickin and keeps on ticking" Not a lie.....Reliable , durable and while it can't make a phone call or give you your bank balance, it  keeps good time and lasts and lasts and lasts...<br/>Doesn't require lots of cash either. So, 10 years for $37 is more than a bargain.<br/>Timex makes a great watch and when my last one finally (12 years) passed on, I ordered a new one in minutes. I appreciate value and the quality of this time keeper.</span>

Being square never looked so good. These timepieces, inspired by the classic design of the DW-5600 from G-Shock actually have an octagonal case shape and button guards that prevent accidental operation. A large case, available in a host of colors with gloss finishes and a 7-year battery make for stylish and reliable timepiece. Gloss white resin band digital watch with white face.   CasioWith the launch of its first watch in November 1974, Casio entered the wristwatch market at a time when the watch industry had just discovered digital technology. As a company with cutting-edge electronic technology developed for pocket calculators, Casio entered this field confident that it could develop timepieces that would lead the market.Today, Casio is focusing its efforts on solar-powered radio-controlled watches: the built-in solar battery eliminates the nuisance of replacing batteries, atomic timekeeping means the users never have to reset the time. Recently, Casio launched a series of Bluetooth watches that sync to the users cell phone to automatically update the time. Casio is always moving time forward.

<span>I love this watch! As a woman, I was glad that it doesn't seem masculine or too large. I'm pretty average size and the strap fits me on the third smallest notch. The only issue with that is the excess strap sometimes slips out of the little band or arches away from my arm where it could catch on things, but that hasn't been a big problem. (Better than another watch I had where the little band to hold the excess strap broke.)<br/><br/>This watch is easy to read, and even though it's a very different light feature than the green and black "indiglo" I'm used to, I actually really like the light feature.  It shines a yellow light from the left side, so it hits a bit unevenly, but at night it does the trick.  As others said, it only stays on while the button is pressed, but I don't mind that at all.<br/><br/>The instructions were a little confusing (it tells you how to cycle through the modes before you get to the actual time setting instructions), but all the information is there. I'm only using it for telling time, so I don't know about the other features.  If I have to reset the time I might need to consult the instructions.  It's a few seconds off now, but it keeps time well enough.  I'm glad it does not beep on the hour (at least not the way I have it set).  It does beep if I cycle through the modes.<br/><br/>I have not tested it underwater because my previous watch (another company) the waterproofing went bad and I don't want to deal with that again, but splashes from washing my hands have not caused a problem so far.  No water inside the face.<br/>About 2 months in I am just now noticing the dark discoloration on the band. I think this is not it picking up colors, but most likely the white wearing off on the edges of the strap. It's not really noticeable unless I'm looking for it, although I expect it will get worse.<br/><br/>All in all, a solid little watch.  (And stylish, too!)</span>
