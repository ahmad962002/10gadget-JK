<span>Band was easy to adjust - standard link removal.<br/>I have a 6 3/4 inch wrist &amp; this is the perfect size case at 40mm.<br/>It's still big enough to make a statement, but not so big that it looks like a silly invicta, or one of those ridiculous Frisbee sized watches.<br/>I've had this for over a month now and I haven't had to adjust the time - so it keeps time well - which is what you should expect with a quartz watch.<br/>I thought it would take some adjusting as I've only worn smart watches for the last 6 years, but the face is easy to read.<br/>In a world where everyone is wearing a smartwatch, this stands out.  It looks like it's more expensive than it is.  If you're not wearing an apple watch, people assume you can't afford one, so you're wearing a casio or some other cheap watch.  When you wear this, people won't assume that it's cheap.  It's a different statement: I'm wearing this because the apple watch is cheap.<br/>After reading all of the reviews questioning if this is real I registered it on Tissot's portal using the serial number on the back, and it's legit.</span>

<span>I rarely write reviews. I feel compelled however as I could not find the specific information I was looking for in my research to buy this watch.  I hope this review helps anyone with the same questions I had.  The main problem I had with my old watch was the crown pulling out when I removed my hand from my front pants pocket.  I wouldn't notice until I was late to be somewhere and then I would remove the watch in frustration.  I have a divers watch with a screw down crown but it's not a chronograph and I use the chronograph all the time. The SA Maverick  doesn't have a screw down crown but I am happy to report that I haven't had the crown pull out inadvertently even once.  Problem one solved.  My old chronograph was low end and as a result the hands and markers didn't line up as well as I would like. Not an issue with the Maverick. This thing is dead nuts. Everything lines up perfectly. When the secondhand strikes 60 the minute hand moves in perfect sync.  Even the rotating bezel moves a precise 120 clicks, full circle, and stops exactly on each marker.  I've got OCD and those kinds of things can get to me , but not with this watch.  It only loses a 1/2 second every 3 months.  I don't know how that compares with other watches in this class but I'm happy with that.  Problem two solved.  Every other question I had was answered through extensive online research and reviews.  This watch was selling in the neighborhood of $400 at the time but I found a deal at only $250.  I figured I had a better than even chance that it was a fake.  I rolled the dice and lucked out.  I couldn't be happier.  I hope this review helps someone.</span>

I have an Omega Speedmaster which makes an elegant statement but wanted to try a Tissot because of the reputation. The quality is definitely superb so I will make this watch my “workhorse” to see how it holds up. This model is definitely an eye catcher so far.</span>

<span>The photograph of this watch for this ad is misleading. I'm writing this on 6/6/22, so maybe the photo will be changed/updated sometime after this review.<br/><br/>The problems with the photo for this ad are as follows:<br/><br/>1. It looks like it has a flat white painted background. It's actually more like a machined, light colored metal.<br/>2. The outlines of the markers appear to be a light to medium gray. In reality they're either black or a very dark gray.<br/>3. The outer "ring" of the watch is black, not a medium-dark gray.<br/><br/>I suspect that someone reduced the contrast of watch photos to try and bring out the details on the outer ring. I would recommend that if you're interested in this watch, do a google search using "Tissot T1154272703100" and then click on the "Images" Google link, as some photos will show this watch in a more accurate light.<br/><br/>With all that said, here's my review of the actual watch:<br/><br/>I love it! The contrast is great, the black on light-machined metal markers stand out and are very easy to read, and the hands are aligned almost perfectly. Being an automatic watch (mechanical vs. electronic quartz) its accuracy can't be expected to match a quartz based movement, but so far this has only been off a second or two over a 24 hour period. The markings for the hour and minute hands as well as the hour markers are luminous, and the luminosity is good (good, not excellent).<br/><br/>Barring some unforeseen upcoming disaster, I have to rate this watch 5 out of 5 stars for all of Amazon's review categories.</span>

The essence of the Tissot T-Race are features inspired by motorcycle The push-pieces are engraved with the words Start and Reset reminding of the commands setting of a racing bike. Another extra touch is the silicone bracelet giving an additional hint about the motobiker style the watch wants to suggest.

For more than 150 years, Tissot has embodied the innovation and tradition of Swiss watch-making. Based in the Neuchâtel area of the Jura Mountains, in Le Locle, Switzerland, Charles-Félicien Tissot and his son Charles-Emile created the watch making company Tissot in 1853. Whether in the technology of its movements, in the research for special materials or in the very functions of the watch itself, Tissot's engineers and watchmakers have developed pioneering timepieces over the years.  Some of Tissot's triumphs over the years include the the Idea 2001 (the world's first plastic watch) released in 1971, the Rock watch (which set the timepiece's movement in a stone case made from Swiss Alps granite) in 1985, and the Wood watch from 1988 (with a completely wooden case). Tissot uses the best movements (from ETA SA Manufacture Horlogère Suisse), the highest quality materials (316L steel, 18K gold, titanium) and scratch-proof glasses (sapphire crystal--at least 2500 Vickers).  The company has been involved with high profile sports events since 1974 when they sponsored a racing car in the 24 Hours of Le Mans, France. Since then Tissot's timepieces have been chosen as official timekeepers for world championships in cycling, motorcycling, fencing and ice hockey. And Tissot is currently the the official watch and timekeeper of NASCAR.  Tissot timepieces have been worn by a bevy of celebrities over the years--including Grace Kelly, Elvis Presley and Nelson Mandela--and James Stewart's character L.B. Jefferies wore a Tissot timepiece in Alfred Hitchcock's "Rear Window." Today the company is represented in a variety of sporting fields by English soccer star Michael Owen, IndyCar driver Danica Patrick, and MotoGP world champion Nicky Hayden. Today, Tissot is a member of the Swatch Group, the world's largest watch producer and distributor.  Stainless steel case with a stainless steel bracelet. Fixed stainless steel bezel. Silver dial with silver-tone hands and index hour markers. Tachymeter around the outer rim.

<span>I always wanted to own a Swiss automatic watch and was struggling with case diameter as I wanted a big one. This one is just perfect for guys with big arm and looks quite good in hand. It's a great combination of beauty and quality.<br/><br/>One thing I have realised after months of usage and not happy with is a power reserve, sometimes it 's also lagging!</span>

<span>You can’t go wrong with a Swiss watch and if self winding, even better. The Tissot Couturier is a beautiful watch. Elegant, heavy and simple. For about $1,000, you get a watch that will last with the superb quality that only Swiss watches can bring.</span>

<span>Beautiful watch with great craftsmanship. I have several what I would call mid range $400-2500 watches and this is definitely one of my favorites. As with any auto it is pretty heavy and bulky but that doesn't take away from the beauty of this watch. The contrast between the hands and the background in white is very subtle but easy to pick up the time quickly. The phos glow on the hands holds a charge forever which is nice to be able to tell time after dark. I have received a lot of compliments. This is actually my second Tissot, my first one took a dive off the back of my boat and I missed it so much I had to buy another one!! You won't be disappointed in this time piece.</span>

Victorinox Swiss Army – History Master Cutler Karl Elsener opened a cutlery shop in Ibach, Switzerland in 1884. Seven years later, in 1891, Karl supplied the Swiss Army with its standard issue Soldier’s Knife. After the death of his mother in 1909, Karl Elsener introduced the brand name Victoria and the iconic Cross and Shield emblem is registered as a trademark. With the advent of stainless steel, Karl Elsener coined the company’s name, Victorinox, by combining his mother’s name with “inox”, an abbreviation of the French word for rust-resistant steel, “inoxydable”. After World War II, the “Original Swiss Army Knife” began its successful progression around the world and enjoyed exceptional popularity. In 1989, Victorinox entered the timepiece business in the United States under the brand name “Swiss Army”. Ten years later, Victorinox joined the Travel Gear market, partnering with TRG Group in St. Louis. And in 2001, Victorinox fashion was introduced in the US to further capture the brand’s essence of practical luxury. In 2002, in order to promote global unity, the Victorinox Swiss Army timepiece brand was launched internationally. In 2007, Victorinox set up Victorinox Swiss Army Fragrance AG, and in 2009 Victorinox Swiss Unlimited was launched. 2014 marks Victorinox Swiss Army’s 130th anniversary, and each Victorinox Swiss Army product embodies the spirit of the Legendary Original Swiss Army Knife, a universal symbol of Functionality, Innovation, Quality and Iconic Design. Brand Values FUNCTIONALITY  Our Victorinox Swiss Army timepieces are designed to optimize their usefulness. Functionality ranges from easy-to-read dial designs to sophisticated professional functions. Every design detail is purpose-based. Functions are never add-ons or embellishments. The goal is to create watches that are timeless.  INNOVATION  Victorinox Swiss Army constantly enhances its timepiece lines with new design elements and innovative functions while seeking creative ways of upgrading existing components to enhance their capabilities.  QUALITY  Victorinox Swiss Army timepieces are designed and manufactured with the same rigorous attention to quality as the brand’s legendary Pocket Tools. They also meet the highest standards of the Swiss watchmaking industry. The quality controls and testing that every timepiece undergoes (material, movement, assembly, finishing, etc.) allow Victorinox Swiss Army to offer a three-year limited warranty.  ICONIC DESIGN  The Original Swiss Army Knife is one of the world’s most functional pieces of design. Victorinox Swiss Army timepieces share this icon’s spirit and heritage. They are multifunctional precision instruments engineered to last, yet also timeless and contemporary in design.   Victorinox Swiss Army Officer's chronograph watch features a Swiss analog quartz movement, 42mm stainless steel case, anti-reflective sapphire crystal, silver dial with guilloche accented center, luminous hands and markers, date calendar and stainless steel bracelet. Chronograph allows precision timing up to 30 minutes. Swiss Made and water resistant to 330 feet.

<span>Bought this watch as a gift for my son as a graduation present. He took a shower and the watch came out all foggy on the inside so water got in somehow. How is It supposed to get water inside when is supposed to be waterproof up to 100 M depth ???<br/>My wife and daughter both have Victorinox watches and have had no issues at all after years of use.<br/><br/>I got it when the price went down so took the chance and boght more than 30 days ago but now I'm screwe since  Amazon's return policy is just valid for 30 days and will have to pay for it to be repaired now.</span>
