<span>Bought this for my finance in Colombia. She did the research and picked it. She loves it. She had an android phone when I bought it for her. Harassed me for years about wanting an iphone. I finally gave in and bought her the iphone 13. This watch seamlessly connected to it. Or rather, she did whatever was required. I think she had to download an app onto the iphone. The watch works seamlessly with the new iphone. And battery life - what a joke. My iwatch has to be recharged every night or forget it, I have to use another watch the next day. My finance, charges her watch every 3-5 days and it never dies on her - and she wears it all the time! You cannot beat this watch on price -performance.</span>

<span>Wanted to upgrade from my Amzfit Bit u pro. In some ways this definitely did and in some ways not so much.  I really like it, I purchased an LIGE stainless watch, liked the look and feel but the software and features were not, well, I returned it. The Zepp app is great, there is a fair amount of customization you can do with this watch and all functions work well. There is a temperature sensor, which for the most part always tells you what your skin temperature is, not sure how helpful that is for most of us...  Anyhoo, looks great, feels great, works well.  For some reason you can't pull up your sleep results on the watch, but they record in the app, would love to be able to see it on the watch, did it in the bit u pro but not this watch for whatever reason.  i thought it has some internal storage for music, I guess I got it confused with the GTR 2, the 2e has no speaker and no storage but that battery lasts a long time. That's a trade off.  Overall, great watch but I might be happier with a little less battery and some internal storage and a speaker.  Think about that while deciding, regardless, I'm keeping this one.</span>

<span>Why I bought the Amazfit GTR 2<br/><br/>This is my 3rd time purchasing an Amazfit branded smartwatch. I high recommend getting the GTS 2 or the GTR 2 and not E or Mini versions. I originally purchased the Amazfit GTS 2 Mini and it was nice but I hated the blood oxygen monitor on it, I found myself in many situations where I received phone calls and wanted to answer but couldn't on the GTS Mini. I'm also an Apple Watch 5 owner and I even prefer this watch from that one. I'm no longer stuck in Apple's ecosystem, nor do I have to worry about charging two devices after a full day of work. Apple offers a lot features that you never really use because most of those features you turn off to save battery life. They forget we also need our smartwatch to be an watch an good extension of our phone.<br/><br/>Why I like the GTR 2:<br/><br/>I like the GTR 2 because it's offers a great experience, even from unboxing it.<br/><br/>The screen is beautiful, I mean even more when you see it in person. I have no complaints at all. Absolutely gorgeous. I love the design, I love you can change the straps, and I love it looks like a classic timepiece. The markings are great when you have the analog clock enabled especially when Always-On mode is on. The clock faces are customizable and you can also download them from other apps. Honestly the watch faces are the best thing about this smart watch. Whatever you choose it looks great on the screen and can match with your attire very well.<br/><br/>I really wanted a smart watch for notifications and phone calls, &amp; its great for that too! Now I can check messages and emails at a glance as they come in throughout the days and I don't have to worry about missing that important call because I couldn't hear my phone or maybe I wasn't in a good vicinity to reach it.<br/>It's really a nice feature to have coming from the GTS Mini 2 that only presented notifications and no way to answer calls.<br/><br/>Smart Health features:<br/><br/>This is another reasoning onto why I love this watch. Its smart health features are awesome and very accurate most of the time. Every health feature just works well. I haven't ran into the problems I experienced on the GTS 2 Mini. The Zepp app presents all this information well and I utilize the information to help me experience better sleep and exercise.<br/><br/>Alarm: Yeah, I know most reviewers don't talk about the simple stuff but having this watch as alarm is great. First, I don't need a loud siren to wake me up when I wear this watch. It vibrates my wrist to a custom vibration and my body knows to wake up and get active. No more snoozes, no more stress from an alarm.<br/><br/>And the reason all of these features work is because of the battery life of this device being around 7 to 14 days on a single charge. I don't have to worry about charging, so everything is a connivence to use and it makes more fun and just worth the money also you get these features on the watch that make it even more of a bargain:<br/><br/>Waterproof: take it in the shower, wash the dishes, is it working? Yes! Go swim, you good, it can handle it.<br/><br/>Alexa &amp; offline voice commands: Yep you can control your smart home from the Alexa on your watch, ask it questions. You can also control the watch just by using your voice. Not a feature I use all the time but its there and most important it works well.<br/><br/>3gb of Music storage: they didn't lie here either, you can store up to 600 mp3s on this watch and enjoy them on the go or connect to some earbuds.<br/><br/>Find my phone: I use this more often than not, the watch has good range. I always find my phone with this feature.<br/><br/>Weather: It's so awesome to wake up look at your wrist and know to weather for the day. Didn't even have to reach for the phone at all. Just took a shower and got dressed for the day.<br/><br/>Verdict:<br/>I could go all day singing GTR 2's praises, there's too much to love here and not so much to hate. Most of the problems that I see on YouTube from the original reviews have been fixed. It's not sluggish, it's very snappy. It's updated with Alexa. &amp; I hear Amazfit is working on other update soon. Hopefully they add the camera remote back in on this watch cause that's a convenient feature to have as well. It's a MUST BUY for anyone wanting a smartwatch on iPhone or Android.</span>

<span>I'll start with the pros because sadly there aren't many. It feels premium and I personally like the small footprint on my wrist as it's not heavy and is comfortable with the band it ships with. Everything else leaves me wondering why I've stuck with Google this long. Battery life is the main reason I returned this watch. If you don't ever touch it, leave the screen dark, disable every feature you can and leave battery saver on constantly, you'll get at most 20 hours of use per day because the thing can't make it a full 24 hours, even when you aren't wearing it at all! I have to charge 2-3 times per day (twice if I do no exercise at all) and it takes around 1.5-2 hours to charge, which seems excessive given my phone can charge from 0-100% in 28 minutes. When you aren't charging, you have to deal with no spo2 sensor (even though it has one), AFib tracking doesn't work constantly and the speakerphone is ENTIRELY UNUSABLE. It crackles when turned up loud enough to almost hear it and when it isn't crackling it's not loud enough to make out voice. You can't even hear the Assistant talk and the alarm wouldn't be noticeable if not for the vibrating. This watch makes me want to spend thousands to switch back and be an Apple customer after years of leaning towards Google for everything. This watch was a swing and a huge miss. This watch doesn't even compete with 5 year old watches out there. Not sure what Google was thinking, but it's making me reconsider being a Google Fanboy as no other Android watch checks all the boxes. My other complaint is the FitBit Premium membership needed to keep most of your data long-term unless you export it elsewhere (which isn't too difficult). Ultimately this experience pushed me to decide to not use a watch for now and I'm going to quit using Google Fit on my phone as I feel I should be getting paid for them to keep and sell my data to others. My other negative is the impact that this has to the environment. While the manufacturing process already did enough damage, this watch needs so much electricity to  stay alive that it will cost me more than the watches value to keep it charged, creating more unnecessary environmental impact and costing me more in electricity daily.  I can't even believe that I came to these conclusions because I'm a techie/nerd and usually need all the latest/greatest products.<br/><br/>Would not recommend this subpar watch, most likely will convert me from Googles [clearly] subpar Ecosystem. Even Fitbit Sense (which Google owns) gets at least 6x battery life and has more features, but Google made lots of promises for that watch that they still have yet to deliver - so I'm going without a watch now. Very sad this is what they released as their first watch. Maybe they should have waited yet another year if this is all they could do? Everyone I know that got a Pixel watch returned them and everyone I knew that wanted one no longer does. Pretty sad, but you sure aren't getting what you're paying for here. Google needs to remember who their customers are...</span>

<span>Most negative reviews for this watch point out it's size and battery life, however only one of these things is an issue for me.<br/><br/>I have slim wrists, and this fits like a dream (unlike 99% of android smart watches). The build quality is superb yet not bulky, the screen is vibrant, and the official stretch band makes this the most comfortable smart watch I've ever tried, period.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, the battery life while manageable leaves a lot be desired (getting ~20-30 hours with 'always on' enabled, and 'rotate to wake' disabled), and it's overall been very buggy, at this time not even allowing me to connect to staple features such as Google assistant, or pay.<br/><br/>I'm positive the software issues will be ironed out with updates, but until then it's quality and size still makes this an ideal pair for my pixel.</span>

I would recommend it because if I would recommend it, it is fantastic.

<span>The Pros: This watch is gorgeous. Like Google has done with its entire pixel line, the Pixel Watch has a completely distinct look that sets it apart from others. The battery life was acceptably good (not great), and it did all of the tasks it advertised well.<br/><br/>The Cons: The price... It is too expensive when its primary competitors from Samsung have the same features at a cost closer to the 280 mark (versus this watch's 400 dollar price tag). I also hated the fact that they used a proprietary system for their watch bands. (Already a few 3rd party watch bands can be used to fix this problem, but it shouldn't have been an issue in the first place). The main reason I have respected Google so far was for the things it did to STOP proprietary measures (making Android open source, etc.)</span>

<span>This is my second smartwatch. My first smart watch was a Huawei First Generation. I was very resistant at first getting a smart watch because I hate the square bezel look ( Apple). My Huawei still works but after about four years of ownership the LCD screen has been developing some "artifacts" ( LCD burn in, like the old plasma TVs).<br/>I've been watching some smart watches for about 1 year now and had price alerts on them. The Fossil went considerably lower, to a price that I was comfortable with ( well under $200 ). I had to buy it. I had my eye on some Samsung Galaxy which I heard has amazing battery life but since my old watch was using Wear OS Google, I didn't feel like jumping ship to Tizen.<br/>So, the good about the watch...it is a very good looking watch. I have the metal bracelet smoke. I like the fact that the screen on the outside is just as big as my Huawei (44mm I think) which isn't big. I have a medium size wrist. It is thinner and much lighter than Huawei 1st generation. The quality of the graphics is top notch. Set up was easy, painless on my Motorola Z4 phone. It stays connected, never drops off bluetooth. I didn't buy it to use the workout functions. They could be great, I don't know but if I wanted a workout watch I would buy an ugly square Garmin or whatever. I like to get texts, answer calls on it, do some speech to text replies. It works great for that. The screen brightness I think it is great. I keep it on auto or brightness at level 2.<br/>So, now the bad. Biggest elephant in the room is the battery life. I kept it on the daily battery function with brightness on auto and most of the sensors off, but wifi and bluetooth on. I also keep the screen always on, but obviously it darkness a little after 3-5 seconds. I don't want that function off. I need to be able to see what time it is at a quick glance without needing to touch the screen, buttons, etc. I do get notifications but only messages ( WhatsApp, Viber and Messages). I don't really talk on it. I get about 15-25 WhatsApp messages per day, 20-25 texts and 3-4 Viber texts. I never check heart rate, never use GPS, NFC ( those are off). So my first day with it, the battery lasted 12 hours. My 4 year old Huawei lasts the same.🤔<br/>I know the battery is only slightly bigger in Fossil than the Huawei but c'mon...I was expecting close to 24 hrs.<br/>Also, the graphics of watch faces don't seem to cover the whole glass area. There's a tiny portion that isn't covered. Not a big deal but my Huawei is pretty much full screen. So I don't want to say Fossil is a bad watch. Not at all, but let me summarize. If I had paid $295 ( full price) for my Huawei 1st generation, I would  still be very pleased. If I would have paid $280 for the Fossil...hmm....😳....not really. Battery let's it down. At the price I paid? I am not dancing with joy but I think is ok. I am torn between three and four stars but battery life is a big deal to me and because of this, I have a hard time giving it a four.<br/>So, after a few days of playing with the setting I think I can get 16-18 hrs of battery which I guess it's ok. I turn Wifi Off, NFC off, heart monitoring off and I keep the brightness at 2 which for me is plenty. The watch is otherwise flawless. I decided to give it a four star.</span>

<span>I've been a wear OS (Android Wear) person pretty much since the first few watches came out.  I first got the Moto 360 and then the Huawei Watch and then the Huawei Watch 2.  In each instance, I've been fairly happy with the devices and the quality of the devices themselves.  Wear OS's problems are something else.  That's Google for you but given that I'm not a Samsung or Apple fan, I've done what I can to steer clear of those brands.<br/><br/>My last Wear OS watch was the Huawei Watch 2 and I got a full 2 years of use out of that one.  Towards the end, it started to act up but that coincided with the release of the Gen 5 and the subsequent sale on Black Friday.  I was waiting for that to happen, hoping to eek out a few more days and weeks from my Huawei watch.<br/><br/>So far, I've only had my Gen 5 for a couple of days.  It's hard to say how the battery life is after just those 2 days but I can say this.  The watch charges fast.  Real fast.  I was at 58% yesterday and I set it on the charger before I went to wash up for bed.  By the time I got back to the watch, it was fully charged.  That was maybe 30 minutes.  So I took the watch off the charger and I set it aside to see what the battery power would look like in the morning.  Not too shabby...it was at 91% this morning when I put it on.<br/><br/>The Huawei watch had 768MB of ram (IF memory serves correctly) but even with that, Wear OS was still sort of slow and glitchy.  The 1GB on the Gen 5 definitely makes a difference.  It still has moments when it glitches and slows a little but it's a lot better.  I don't have nearly as many moments.  The watch is much more responsive and I think I will enjoy getting Google Pay back.  For the most part, I would have to say the Gen 5 is very smooth and responsive.  Coming from those other watches, I have nothing to complain about.<br/><br/>Just a comparison...I also recently bought my wife a Samsung Galaxy watch.  Yes, I went to Samsung for her but she also owns a Samsung phone and doesn't have the same feelings about Samsung as I.  She started using it on Friday and even though she is happy with it overall, her battery isn't doing any better than my Gen 5.  She did get the smaller 42mm version with the smaller battery but I've seen numerous reviews about it saying that they get about 2&amp;1/2 days to even 3 days out of a charge.  The wife might swing 1&amp;1/2 days which is on par with what I'm seeing with the Gen 5.  But I can say one thing...helping her setup of the Tizen OS based watch made me want to stick with my familiar Wear OS watch even more.  You can't undo 4+ years of familiarity with a particular brand.<br/><br/>About the Gen 5, I really like the big main button with the spinning dial.  The galaxy watch has the spinning bezel.  This has the spinning dial and I think I like that more than the spinning bezel.  Google assistant pulls up fast and it listens pretty well.  I was having some issues having it text my wife but that's something I'll check on further.  But at least between my phone and my watch, if I need to rattle off a quick message to someone while driving, I can voice activate things and speak my message and get it done that way without taking my attention off the road.<br/><br/>So far, this watch has been everything that I wanted and hoped for.  I haven't tested the watch in water yet and I might not do that anytime too soon as I don't hit the water too often.  But I'm sure it's better than my Huawei watch and I took that into the pool a few times.<br/><br/>From having my eye on this watch since it was announced to seeing it in store at a Fossil in Vegas and to finally getting it on my wrist, I can honestly say that this is the best Wear OS has to offer.  Fossil makes most of the watches with wear os.  The Emporio Armani Smartwatch 3 is a nice looking watch and it was just announced but I don't think it's worth the extra money.  The Gen 5 I think looks like a very nice watch.  It can work in any situation.  Much more versatile than my Huawei watch 2.<br/><br/>Update:  I can definitely confirm that I love my gen 5. I've had it for a couple of weeks now. It feels so familiar to me but it runs so much smoother than all the previous watches. The battery life gets me a full day without any trouble. I'm using a watch face off the play store that gives me options to show on the screen. But even with this face and constant notifications all day, I'm somewhere between 45-60% after 16 hours. I could probably eek out 2 days in some situations but I'm an overnight charging person anyways so why bother trying for it... This is the best of wear os until the new chip gets released and maybe, something from Google gets released now that they own fitbit.</span>

<span>I've had this for just under a week now and so far I really like it. My only legit complaint is the knobs and buttons on the side of the watch frame. I wish they were flat, I find that I accidentally long press the google assistant button a lot when I have to bend my wrist for more than a second. This hasn't been enough for me to return the watch though. I've just ended up pushing it up on my wrist a little higher and it seems to have helped. Additionally, the wrist straps are incredibly easy to swap. There's just a little silver nub where the band connects to the watch on the underside, you have to slide and hold it and the band comes out. Makes for incredibly easy changing between sport bands and nicer leather or metal bands for more formal situations. I took them both off and put them back on in less than a minute.<br/><br/>Now for the big stuff -- I'll get right to it first and foremost since it is mentioned in a lot of reviews. The battery...<br/><br/>**For anyone claiming to have terrible battery right out of the box, I suggest installing all the updates and doing a full overnight charge first. Battery performance was a little wonky during setup and while downloading and installing the updates, but after the first night it's been great. If you still have trouble then I suggest returning it or contacting Fossil for support for defective battery. ***<br/><br/>BATTERY LIFE - I've customized some of the features, but for the most part they're all on. I've only turned off the sound and the ability to answer and take calls on the watch. I've never had to do take a call on my watch and I just see it as an irrelevant feature personally.  Additionally, I don't have the screen set to "always on" or "touch to wake" and instead use "tilt to wake". I start my day at 6:30a with 100% watch battery and arrive home about 5p every day and haven't fallen below 60% battery. This is with the features below on and with normal use by replying to texts, tracking walks with GPS, setting timers and alerts and occasionally using the google assistant.<br/><br/>I have the following all turned on 100% of the time:<br/>-GPS (only activates while tracking exercise)<br/>-Wifi - always on and connected to my phone when not in bluetooth range<br/>-Cloud backup<br/>-Heart rate  monitoring (set to measure HR every 10 minutes all day)<br/>-Google Fit Syncing<br/><br/>Water resistance - According to the Fossil website, this watch is 3 ATM rated water resistance which means you can shower, wash your hands, get sweaty, etc without worrying. The 3 ATM rating means you should (in theory) be able to submerge your watch in water while swimming up to a depth of 100 feet. I personally don't know if I want to test this, but I have gotten it wet while washing my hands and its been fine.<br/><br/>It's got a little bit of weight to it, so coming from a samsung gearfit that was rectangle and very light, it's taken some getting used to with the weight and round shape. It is a solid watch though.<br/><br/>The screen is excellent, I've used it in a variety of lighting, including high-noon direct sunlight and the screen brightens up and it's perfectly readable. If you have bigger fingers, some of the buttons can be a little annoying to tap, but overall I've not had any major issue with the touch screen.<br/><br/>The silicon strap is comfortable and has many notches for the perfect fit. As I said above, also incredibly easy to swap between the sport bands and a nicer leather or metal band.<br/><br/>In conclusion, I was worried a little bit about getting a round watch and I had been keeping my eye out for a square option, but I haven't found any with Wear OS support (this was important to me for fitness tracking with google Fit). I'm glad I went with this option though because the watch looks great and I can get a nicer band to wear to more formal functions.</span>

<span>I've had this watch (Gen 5e with leather band) for two weeks now, and after playing around with it and doing one factory reset, I'm pleased with the battery life and functions.<br/><br/>The watch body is very substantial, with a polished nickel finish and ridges around the watch face. There is one button on the right, and the watch body comes out on either side to protect it from being bumped. The back is a textured plastic that feels very solid. It is not a lightweight watch, to be sure. But I've gotten used to the heft, even after not wearing a watch since I was a teenager. The band is genuine leather on the outside with a silicone back. I'm hoping it forms to my wrist more with a little wear, but it's comfortable, and it has never snagged on any hairs.<br/><br/>The first few days, I was playing with features more, and added some apps. I wasn't familiar with the watch face customizations, so I put some non-stock watch-face apps on it. I put Messages, Outlook, and the Roku remote apps on it. And I enabled developer options (which seems to have had a negative impact on battery life).<br/><br/>My goal for a smart watch was really just the notifications so I don't miss meetings, emails, texts, etc, if I'm away from my phone. After a little more than a week, and having battery life issues, I did a factory reset and paired it again with my phone, knowing what I wanted to use this time.<br/><br/>I did not opt for any of the fitness tracking features (heart rate sensor, basically). I think it still runs, but no apps are using it. I uninstalled everything on the stock setup that was allowed (Facer and Spotify and a few others). I never enabled the permissions for sensors, so no apps should be using those. The only thing I added was Messages so I could respond to texts without getting my phone out.<br/><br/>Since doing this a couple days ago, my battery life is way up. At the moment, I'm 9 hours since unplugging it, and it is at 70% battery with the default power settings ("Daily Battery Mode"). I haven't answered calls or used the speech-to-text, but unless you are doing that a lot, the battery is plenty for all day. Before doing the reset (with developer mode enabled, which I think was the culprit), it was down to about 30% after 8-9 hours.<br/><br/>In summary, for my use case (notifications, calendar, time) it works great. I got it on sale, so it was even more worthwhile. It looks nice, and the interface is fairly responsive. Text on the screen is sharp and readable. I wish it were a bit lighter, but overall very pleased.</span>

<span>I personally was never big on the idea of smart watches.  I decided to get this mostly to keep track of my steps and so I wouldn't miss calls since I usually just keep my phone on silent.  I have had this less than a month and have enjoyed it a lot more than I thought I would.  There is a lot of functionality and it is useful for everyday tasks.  Would be 5 stars if the paint on the watch band wasn't already starting to wear off in places.  No real complaints other than that.</span>

<span>I think after having a basic Apple smart watch, this Fossil watch is basically a glorified digital watch and you're basically shelling out big bucks for the Fossil name and that's about it.<br/><br/>In terms of customization, you're extremely limited. There's maybe 20 pre-selected faces for your watch, and at least for me, almost none of them ended up appealing to me. The watch always says it's not connected to my phone, yet still shows texts, not a big deal but slightly annoying with the little "no connection" symbol ever present.<br/><br/>Worst of all, the battery life is absolutely worthless. I'll charge it the night before and then half way through my 8 hour shift (after ONLY using it to check the time), it'll be at 10% battery life.<br/><br/>In terms of using it to quickly send messages back or using apps it's mediocre at best. I really miss my Apple watch and regret downgrading and more than anything, I regret that it took me more than 30 days since I bought it to realize how much of a massive waste of money this watch was; since now I'm stuck with it.</span>

<span>Had it for a little while now. For a watch that isn't assigned it's own number when you're too far from your phone, it works pretty well. The range is nice. So far no technical issues. It gets the job done. Sometimes it loses connection completely and I have to reboot it but it always picks up afterwards. The only complaint I have is how short the battery seems to be. I mean it works when I need it to but the battery doesn't last long enough for me to track my sleep. I'm not sure it would do it accurately any way. The step counter seems to record certain movements as steps even when I'm sitting or driving. But for calla, texts, payments, etc it works. So I'm satisfied with it.</span>

<span>After researching a few different smartwatches, I am really glad that I landed on this Fossil watch with Wear OS. As someone who currently doesn't have a big name phone (no Galaxy or Apple), nor did I want to have to pay a subscription fee to unlock my smart watch's full capabilities (FitBit...), I was glad to find that Wear OS was what I needed. The Fossil brand is reputable and as far as this watch goes, it has been durable AND pretty. The band is like a lilac color. The stones around the face watch give a nice glimmer/shine in the light, which is a nice touch.<br/><br/>The watch's capabilities have everything I wanted: Google pay (SO, SO NICE to have to tap to pay!!) talk to text, notifications routed to watch, sleep tracker, step counter, and even a blood oxygen monitor which is nice in these pandemic times.<br/><br/>A few other things that have been nice to have: taking phone calls on my watch(!!!), timer capabilities, calendar/agenda.<br/><br/>I found in my research that a lot of smart watches focus on step counting, heart rate stuff and health which is nice but I was looking for details on functionality beyond that like responding to text messages, paying with my watch and maybe listening to music (this watch currently only supports spotify so I can't say how good or bad it is as I use another service and haven't yet tried spotify). This watch checks all those boxes. I love that when I'm working, i can quickly and discreetly respond to messages or swipe away calls. If i want to leave my wallet behind, i can tap to pay qithout dragging my phone out. The Wear OS app has a few different watch faces and helps you set the watch up to your liking. I'm pretty happy with that. The battery life has been great--able to wear and use all day and still have about 30% left by the end of the day. Not bad!<br/><br/>The only thing I would change is the ability to access text messages. As far as I can see you can only respond when you get a new one in, and can't start one. There is so much going on with this watch, I am sure I just missed it somehow!<br/><br/>This says it will support ALEXA but as of this review it hasn't rolled out yet. Still great without it.<br/><br/>The buttons on the side are a little bulky and get caught on things now and then. However, I really like using them as shortcuts! It has helped. The face watch is definitely big enough to swipe with no issues. And it's circular face still allows for plenty of screen.<br/><br/>This is getting long but it is a really cool, high functioning watch. It doesn't clash with my everyday clothes and has looked great on my wrist.</span>

<span>I liked this watch. It was beautiful. There was no way to see a report on the app.  I needed a watch with good battery life and this wasn't it.  The band irritated my wrist and one of the rhinestones came out.  I can't imagine if I would of kept it how many more would of came out.  The watch was way too expensive to not fit my needs.</span>

<span>I have been waiting 2 years for a smartwatch to come along to replace my beloved Pebble round. Finally I pulled the trigger with this Fossil 5E. For the most part I like it a lot. It has some interesting features, the best of which are the pull menus. you can pull from the top, the left, or the bottom and get different menus. If you pull from the top you can quickly turn off sound, put the phone in do not disturb mode, or turn off the screen until you press the button. If you pull from the bottom, you can see all your notifications. If you pull from the left, you can access your Google Assistant and send texts, control your Google smart home, etc. The apps that come on this watch are pretty extensive, since Wear OS has finally been updated. I enjoy using Google Pay from my watch and leaving my wallet in my pocket. One thing I did not realize right away is that all the watch faces that come with the 5E are customizable. You can choose what, if any, digital buttons to add to your watch face. The only con is the battery life. With normal use it will last almost 24 hours. If it could beat the 24-hour mark, that would be better. Also, if you turn on heart rate monitoring, the battery will only last between 6 and 8 hours. For that reason I leave heart rate monitoring off. Overall, this watch gives you a great deal of bang for your buck. I recommend!</span>

<span>I use this in correlation with my Galaxy S22+. I have not used the sleep feature as of yet. The battery life goes pretty fast so I would not leave on the Always On Display and at most only have it turned on when you flip your wrist. As for the features, it has a lot of apps that you may have on your phone and it can read texts and incoming calls as well. I wouldn't use this with an iPhone of course. You can set it up to show notifications if you're not wanting to take out your phone. I use it mostly for snapchat notifications.</span>

<blockquote><em><div class="a-row a-spacing-small review-data"><span class="a-size-base review-text review-text-content" data-hook="review-body">
<span>because it is kinda like an iphone on your wrist, it takes up a lot of batteries. If I turn on power-saving mode and pick the most simple watch-face, then from 6am-8pm I will have 64% left when I don't receive text message or text back.<br/><br/>Images are good, almost like looking at my phone, contrast, colors, and accuracy of pixel is good.<br/><br/>Texting- I like how I can text talk and it'll respond in what I say. This usually drops my battery life most. Btw, the texting language has to be the language of the programmed language of the watch, so don't try to respond using voice-texting in a diff language than the one programmed on the watch. Like if I programmed it as "English", I can voice-text only in english and not Vietnamese or Spanish.<br/><br/>Sleep-monitoring- in the morning it'll tell me how many hours of sleep, light-sleep, REM, and more. It's good, through the pulse-oximeter reading of my sleep patterns, I learned I had sleep apnea. It gives a range of your Pulse-Ox when you sleep at night like 85-95% detailing perhaps that night I was more stressed and didn't work out, so lung capacity decreased. It's a good monitoring tool.<br/><br/>Water-resistant- I'm a nurse at a hospital, I wash my hands all the time, so far no water issues. I never had to turn on the water resistant option, and use it all the time. Though, after 12 hours, the heaviness of the watch drains me, so I like to give my wrist a break and take it off to charge.<br/><br/>Battery life- I have to charge daily with this, can't go a day without it. But the upsize is that it charges QUICKLY. Within 15 minutes of charging, it can go from 15% to 50%, and from 85% to 100%. It charges quickly, but drains quickly too.<br/><br/>Phone reception- I used it once or twice bc I don't use my phones for calls much but more for instant messaging. Clear reception, my mom heard me well, and we were able to carry a convo while I shopped at Walmart. Wouldn't recommend using this option in confined space though.<br/><br/>Steps- it over calculates my steps, giving me the impression that I've walked longer, but no.<br/><br/>EKG- It's good, idk how accurate it is, but so far it's good.<br/><br/>Benefits- when you are on GPS mode, it'll have it on your watch, and beeps or vibrates when a turn or stop is needed. Really cool, in case you lose your phone while driving, or don't have a phone holder in your car, this function is cool.</span>

<span>I love this watch! Great style, functionality, battery life, size and tracking. I have not used the EMG setting because it requires you to download something, and I just don't have the space on my phone, but every other setting can be manages through Samsung Health and Galaxy Watch Manager. I had a Samsung Frontier watch that couldn't keep a charge, and this one goes at least 2 days before I need to charge it, and Is only because I have GPS tracking on it. I love that they got rid of the bezel, and now you can just use the screen- it cuts down on the bulkiness of the watch. I would 10/10 recommend this watch</span>

<span>40MM is a very decent size, I don't believe 4mm more for $100-150 is worth it.  Besides picking up this G4 40MM on Amazon Day(s) for 50% off.  I've always wanted a smart watch and I got a cheap one from China free through mode credits..and I was so disappointed.  It wasn't even loud enough to hear my messages, making it pointless for my use (hearing messages while @ work with noise around regularly.)  So far I'm in love with this watch.  I would have opted for the Black / Green version cause I see the White Band getting dirty easily and quickly..But I wasn't about to pay an extra $50 for a black version.  Besides you can replace the bands anyway.  I wanna pick up a leather one at one point, and a green screen protector.  Highly recommend this product, wait for a deal though cause they happen often.  Even on Samsung's site they are decently priced.  Also have financing available on the Samsung website similar to Affirm with Amazaon.  Go get you one, or gift one to your techy friend or family member.  Perfect gift for tech/gadget lovers.  It does it all and then some.  Battery life is my only quip.  It does require nightly charging so far, but that is with using it all day while at work.  Otherwise everything is 5*!</span>
