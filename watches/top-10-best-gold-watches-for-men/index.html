<span>Looks great and keeps excellent time. Looks great in a suit or casual and I get compliments on it a lot.<br/>Also have the twin in gold and alternate. These Kors watches are terrific.<br/>Can be hard to read in low light due to lack of contrast.</span>

<span>I gave this to my husband as as a wedding day gift and it looked really good. He loves it. It a little big but that's nothing a jeweler can't fix.</span>

<blockquote><em><div class="a-row a-spacing-small review-data"><span class="a-size-base review-text review-text-content" data-hook="review-body">
<span>The watch was very nice. Very bright and a great weight. The only issue I had was it was way too big for me. Before I returned the watch I ran around looking for a jewelry shop to remove a few links and that was unsuccessful. This is a great buy. Just not for me.</span>

<span>It is a really nice watch my husband loves the size it's really big so for those of you looking for a big watch This Is It and it has basic stuff on it so if you're just looking for a watch This Is It I rated the ability to read it a little lower since it does have a dark face so it can make it difficult to read but it only has about four things that you can set so basic time military time hours and minutes I believe but you have to set it it does have instructions anyway he absolutely loves it</span>

<span>I always liked big watches so a Diesel Watch was a natural choice .  I just  had a little trouble figuring out how to adjust the time zone 4 display .  Unlike the other 3 time zones you need to grip it from the bottom instead of pulling straight out when pulling out the crown .  I like the 4 time zone display and the color.  I know this watch goes for over $400 in regular departments stores . So  I paid a really good price,  I can't answer for the watch being water proof .  It probably could take a few rain drops.  My personal opinion ,  I would not wear it in the shower or at  the swimming pool .  This watch is worn to get attention.  Overall a great watch for fans of big display watches</span>

<span>I've had nice watches my whole life including some exotics: Invicta? Who ever heard of them? You have if you're on Amazon. I've had this watch for about a year now and it's held up very well and still running on it's original battery. It's extremely accurate and readable. I get it around water and wet, but I wouldn't go swimming in it. Yes, it's big. But I'm big 6'3" 240 lbs. The abalone face is still just as beautiful as new and hasn't faded from the Sun.<br/><br/>This is the first sub 500 dollar watch I've ever owned and I'm loving it. All gold watches are very hard to find at all. But when you're blonde hair blue eyed, gold is what you should be wearing.<br/><br/>I've been looking for an all gold/blue face 3 dial for over 25 years now and never found one in any brand. No one made one. No one makes one now. I would have gone up to 5,000 dollars for the right watch, but never found one. Even Rolex doesn't make one.<br/><br/>Invicta has at least twenty. Twenty all gold/ blue face 3 dials, and more. really! Look up "Invicta Men's 0073" on Amazon. I bought this to replace an 800 dollar Seiko (all gold/black face; best I could do in a 3 dial) and couldn't be happier. Several times the Invicta should have been scratched and one time the crystal should have really gotten a serious gouge in it and not a scratch on the watch or the crystal and I put it up to the light; wow. Very well built piece and I'm proud to wear it. I need reading glasses these days and can read the time without them. Not true with the Seiko. I went watchless for quite a while and got back into them when I got sick of digging out my cell phone just to see what time it is.<br/><br/> I searched Amazon because I basically gave up on the project. And as usual, here it was on Amazon all along; of all places.<br/><br/>This absolutely stunning all gold/blue face 3-dial watch for under 200.00 (I paid 180) and the abalone matches my eyes. That is so cool and I feel like I hit the jackpot. How can you go wrong? Because of it's ruggedness, it's become my everyday kick around watch, and my dress watch all in one and I could certainly afford two.<br/><br/>That's a first and I've had fine watches since I was 12. That's also a first that I would use the same watch for both. This makes an excellent dress watch. And, I fully expect this watch to last the rest of my life and I'll keep it. Best of all, it's really cheap to replace it if I ever accidentally destroy it and I've done that. Ever see a Seiko after it's been run over by traffic? It looks like a coffee can lid. Time to get a new watch. Hey, I thought that thing was shock proof. LOL<br/><br/>I use the local jeweler for batteries for all my watches and he cleans them while he's got them open; so all should be golden. Get it? It has a retail tag on the box that says 795.00. This would easily pass for that in my world. But they'd ask about the name, and it's a good name.<br/><br/>The 25 year wait was worth it and I highly recommend this watch. Danny J</span>

<span>Theres not much to say about this watch. It just plain works. And it looks good. I wear it every day, it's easy to read, and it costs basically nothing so if I were to break it I would just buy another. The light is pitiful so don't expect to read it in the dark but it's really not a big deal to me.</span>

<span>What could I say about an F91W that hasn't been said? It's a lightweight waterproof watch with a chrono/stopwatch, alarm, backlight, and costs $10 with a battery that probably lasts 5 years plus. It is the ultimate utility watch, that asks nothing of you and will take essentially any amount of abuse. Break it? Oh well, $10 for another one that's exactly like the one you have.<br/><br/>In the year or so I've had this one I've cleaned blood out of the buttons with peroxide, sanitized it daily with bleach wipes, swam in oceans with it, even used it as an alarm clock when the power was out. It's a force to be reckoned with, and if I sold one of my mechanical watches I could buy one of these for every single person who works in my department and still have a thousand dollars left over.<br/><br/>In short, highly recommended.</span>

<blockquote><em><div class="a-row a-spacing-small review-data"><span class="a-size-base review-text review-text-content" data-hook="review-body">
<span>There are simply too many reviews of this watch. So instead of a review I’d like to share with you a conversation I had the other day with one of my co-workers.<br/><br/>Co-work: What’s that on your wrist? Did you borrow that watch from you 10 year old son? It’s so small and cheap looking. I didn’t think you ever knew how to read a LCD display.<br/><br/>Casio F-91W Owner: It’s a Casio F-91W, and no I didn’t borrow it from my son, but sometimes I let him borrow it from me. I know that I typically, prefer analogue watches with a mechanical or automatic movements. I did need to read the instruction manual I figure out how to read the digital display. Once I figured out that the colon on the display is separating the hours (on the left) from the minute (on the right) and the smaller numbers on the far right represent the seconds; it’s actual easier to read that the 3 hand analogues.<br/><br/>Co-work: So, why did you buy this watch? It doesn’t seem to fit in with your Seiko 5, Orient, HMT, Citizen Eco-drive or that Chinese knock-off of an expensive German watch you can’t afford, that you typically wear to the office.<br/><br/>Casio F-91W Owner: It’s nothing like my other watches, but this watch is one of the great classics. This model was first made in 1991, and was the smart watch of its time. The features and price-point is also unbeatable. I got it specifically because I am going on vacation to the beach and I wanted an affordable watch to wear of the beach and in the pool. This is proven technology; this model has been manufacture for over two decades and it’s almost bombproof.<br/><br/>Co-work: Doesn’t WR mean Water Resistant; like splash and rain resistant only. I thought you need at least a 50m or 100m rating to take it swimming.<br/><br/>Casio F-91W Owner: You are completely correct, and completely wrong. A watch worth worrying about needs at least a 50m or preferable a 100m rating just for swimming on the surface more or less. Personally, I wouldn’t take any of my other watches swimming on purpose, even though some of them have a 100m rating. However, this Casio is very modest in cost and I consider the manufactures water resistance rating is very under stated. Sure, if I ruin this watch swimming, the manufacture going to tell me to fly a kite, if I made a warranty claim, but this is a ten dollar watch. If you have ten dollars to wager, like I do, throw caution to the wind or perhaps dive in head first with it. It’s a lot like jaywalking, it’s not recommended, but you not trueing living your life to the fullest if you follow every rule. I sure a G-Shock with 200m water rating is manufacture with more seals and offers better water protection, but I also think that the water resistance rating is partially just marketing to separate Casio’s $10 watches from their $100 watches. I’ve taken this watch in the ocean and dove in swimming pools with no problems.  I’d recommend not pressing the buttons when it’s wet, as well as not being a cry baby if you ruin it, but this watch is suitable for swimming in my book.<br/><br/>Co-work: Wow, what a risk taker, they must be paying you too much, if you have ten bucks to risk like that. So you say it’s was the smart watch of its time back in the day.  What’s so smart about this watch?<br/><br/>Casio F-91W Owner: Well for starters, a day-date complication with annual calendar, that only needs to be corrected for leap years.  It switches between AM/PM and 24 hour format with a single push of a button. It has a hourly repeater that can be turned on and off. A stopwatch function, and am alarm.  Did I mention it has a very dim light, and I believe it was y2k compliant nearly a decade in advance.<br/><br/>Co-work: Wow, I think my iwatch can do all that, but I don’t know how to. I also paid a lot more than you, and I can’t take it swimming. How about battery life? Where’s the charger plug? Is it self-winding, like you Seiko 5, and going to die after a few days off your wrist? I know for sure that in 1991 there was no such thing as wireless charging.<br/><br/>Casio F-91W Owner: It’s much for low tech then wireless charging, or self-winding. It’s powered by a replaceable battery. Casio claims 7-years on a single battery with no daily recharging required.  It’s more likely that the strap will break, before the battery will need to be replaced. It doesn’t need any sunlight either, some people claim to get 10 years on a single battery, it really depends on how frequent the light and alarm functions are utilized. In theory you could hide out in a cave for years without worrying about charging or replacing the battery.<br/><br/>Co-work: Hey, one more question. I know you are married, but ascetically speaking, do you think I watch like this would be helpful in attraction women? It’s kind of ugly looking.<br/><br/>Casio F-91W Owner: Well my friend, with you ugly face and abrasive personality, if a woman takes the time to look at your watch, she’ll be excited to see a practical watch on your wrist.  Well unless she’s a gold digger type, but you don’t need that.  Any women that can’t appreciate a classic watch like this doesn’t even desire to go dutch at McDonalds with you. However, for you, I’d strongly recommend the Casio CA53W, if you want a line of highly desirable ladies wanting to go out with you.  If you wear a Casio CA53W and a lady starts a conversation about your watch, you’ll need to take her somewhere nice, like a sit-down type restaurant, and pay the whole bill, and she’ll surely want a second date when she see you generously calculate 18% gratuity with your calculator watch.</span>

<span>I use this watch at work and love the simplicity of this as a tool. It was good value for the money and well built. The water resistance portion of this seems to work well. I wash my hands with the watch on and it has help up. This is a good buy in my opinion.</span>

<span>The watch was great for the money compared to the in store price but the box was not all that new looking and was kind of falling apart. It wouldn't have been such an issue if it wasn't for the fact I was buying it for a gift and I had to rubber band the box so it wouldn't fall apart while my boyfriend took it out of the bag😬</span>
