                   <h4> What People Say:</h4>
<div class="slideshow-container">
<blockquote><em><div class="a-row a-spacing-small review-data"><span class="a-size-base review-text review-text-content" data-hook="review-body">
<span>If you are looking for a Lunar Pilot, this is the one to get.  While it is similar to the special edition model, which comes with a leather strap, a special edition nylon strap, and a date window, this one more resembles the original.  This particular model lacks a date window, and sports the older "Bulova" font on the dial, which are both traits of the original prototype worn by Astronaut David Scott during the Apollo 15 mission.</span>
</span></div></em></blockquote>
<p> </p>
<blockquote><em><div class="a-row a-spacing-small review-data"><span class="a-size-base review-text review-text-content" data-hook="review-body">
<span>I bought this watch after watching too many reviews and decided to go for the new polished version on nylon "NATO" style strap. The dial is spot on, beautiful printing and the details were nicely done. I was happy to have the polished version with no date window as it looked snappy and could be dressed up. On my 7.25 inch wrist it was not too big but there was a gap at the end of the lugs with leather straps.<br/><br/>The problem I had that made me finally return the watch was that sometimes when I would click the reset button after stopping the chronograph it would click but not fully reset. I had to push harder to make it actually reset. On an almost $400 watch it seemed like that was a silly problem to have.<br/><br/>The other interest problem was that hand on the minute dial for the chronograph was blunt at the end and actually would obscure multiple minute markers which made actually reading the time elapsed difficult.<br/><br/>The refund was issued and I was happy with the experience, I hope that the issue with the reset is not a common one but the second issue is part of the design and may be a deal breaker for those that actually want to use the chronograph function.</span>

<span>Great value for the money I love everything about this watch except its a bit large haha</span>
</span></div></em></blockquote>
<p> </p>
<blockquote><em><div class="a-row a-spacing-small review-data"><span class="a-size-base review-text review-text-content" data-hook="review-body">
<span>I have nothing but good to say about this watch. It's stylish, elegant, crazy accurate, and has the historic element to it. Much like Mr. Wonderful, I prefer to always remove the straps from my watch that come from the manufacturer and replace them with a Crown &amp; Buckle Nato of my liking. The 20mm lug width is perfect for a comfortable Nato on this watch. For those that are saying this is such a massive watch and Bulova should make a smaller case size, I say to try it on and get a feel for it. I was extremely apprehensive about the size, but find that it is my favorite piece and is worn every single day. It fits perfect in any collection due to the heritage, and certainly at some point someone is going to come up to you and ask you about it. It's happened to me on several occasions and I'm always excited someone noticed it.</span>

<span>If you have a vintage style, this watch will be perfect for you. It is very similar in design to field watches used during the Vietnam conflict. As far as timekeeping goes, the watch stays pretty accurate overall. Every few days I notice that the watch gains approximately ten seconds. I simply synchronize the watch to the time on my phone which takes a few seconds and I’m good to go. It is a military design, however, I find that it looks good in any setting such as business casual, hiking/outdoor, or relaxed weekend wear.</span>

<span>Great mechanical field watch! I’m happy to see Bulova recreate some great watches from the archive series. Only a couple of complaints. First, for a field watch there should always be drilled lugs. Simple but makes a world of difference for watch enthusiasts. Second, the 13.5mm thickness feels unnecessary. To compare, a Hamilton Khaki Auto is 12mm thick. Aside from that, this is a great time keeper and a good first attempt at recreating this classic. Get one!</span>

<span>Great watch, tells the time in twelve and twenty-four hours, glows in the dark sometimes, but I changed the strap for a textile NATO jobbie, to look more manly, like James Bond, or maybe a different James, because I bought this to act as a crutch for my flagging machismo, and it works, like clockwork.<br/><br/>And it was a Black Friday deal, so cheap too.

<span>don't let the size discourage you. if you want this watch, you should buy it. it's awesome. I have a 6.75in wrist and it fits great. it's not really any larger than my other chronos (.05mm longer max). it wears well, but doesn't photograph well with smartphone cameras. the FOV is too wide and really makes it jump off the wrist, but it feels right at home</span>

<span>Nice watch, looks great, bit heavy but tolerable<br/>STOP WATCH LEVERS (PUSH BUTTONS) ARE VERY, VERY DIFFICULT TO USE. THERE IS A "SWEET SPOT" THAT YOU HAVE TO HIT IN ORDER TO START/STOP THE TIMER. YOU HAVE TO PUSH THEM WITH PRECISION OR THEY WILL NOT START OF STOP WHEN YOU ACTIVATE THEM.<br/><br/>Be aware of the "sweet spot" problem if you plan on using the timer function. I have found it very frustrating to try to use the timer only to find out the timer did not start or stop when I needed it to because I did not push the levers to hit the "sweet spot".<br/><br/>It is best to take the watch off your wrist to use the timer. This increases the probability the timer will start and stop when you need it.</span>

<span>If you want a time-only watch and like this look, there is literally nothing to complain about here.<br/><br/>Accuracy is going to be a mixed bad but if I recall, for me it's better than +/- 10 seconds a day, which is more than anyone deserves for a mechanical watch at this price.<br/><br/>The crown feels good (surprisingly) and the hands feel solid as you move them around the dial.<br/><br/>I wouldn't mind the watch being larger at maybe 40 mil.<br/><br/>The strap is crap, which is what you can always expect at this price range. I bought a "Halveston" vintage canvas NATO, and it looks gorgeous.<br/><br/>There probably isn't a cheaper way to get into a watch that was issued for military forces. While now owned by Citizen (An excellent Japanese watchmaker), the history of a watch doesn't change based on its current ownership.</span>

<span>I have written a review on the white dial version earlier here.  I love this watch so much that I want to own the black dial version too.  The red 24 hours mark on the other version is not my taste so this version is perfect to me.  Great piece of vintage style watch with great legibility. Great lume too! Excellent build quality! It looks much expensive the price it was! I got over 20 pieces of watches and on weekend you still can’t resist the temptation to put it on!  Easily match with casual wear especially military style outfit. Got some Barton quick release canvas / leather straps here; this piece is easily a strap monster! An easy winner; so much fun with this inexpensive Bulova :)</span>

<span>Just got it, really like the way it looks. I was wanting an WW2 A11, but they were a little more than I was wanting to spend right now on ebay, so I did a little research and found that Bulova was one of the A11 manufactures during that time and saw this watch and it checked all the boxes for me. Really happy for the price I paid.</span>

<span>The understated dial design is overshadowed by the bulky (thick &amp; wide) case with mediocre brushed finishing (nothing bad, per se, just not super clean or elegant). In my opinion, it doesn't look as nice as the photos. The dial needs a splash of color, like the aged lume on the Hamilton Khaki Field watch, or perhaps a touch of green on the numerals. The strap was also too long for my wrist, but I would have replaced it anyway.<br/><br/>The quality just doesn't match the price. Spend $100 more for a Hamilton Khaki field and get a slimmer, more elegant watch with a Swiss movement and 80 hour power reserve. Or spend $100 less for a Baltany D12, which has much nicer finishing, a screw-down crown, and a sapphire crystal.</span>

<span>The fit is nice and the look is clean.  I have had it on my wrist for about 10 minutes.  I know the accuracy is totally dependent on the winding or motion.  It feels like I can wind this at the crown too like my Seiko Prospex automatic.  The Design looks faithful to the original A11 watches from WWII.  I love the smooth perpetual motion of the second hand.  I know I cannot swim with this watch, I have my Seiko 200 M dive watch for that.  Cool watch thanks...  I have had it for about a week and it keeps great time.  I still need my dive watch for swimming and water exposure but this Bulova is nice....</span>

<span>Loved this design and model.  SRPD 91 is one of few Seiko Sports that don't have a polished silver case.  It is more of a charcoal/smoke color and polished but not too much.  I liked this alot but in person I don't think I loved the way it looked on me so I returned it.  The bezel on the one I received did line up accurately.  I didn't love the way the bezel rotated/clicked, felt a little mushy to me for some reason.  I've had others where the click is a very clean feel.  but of course that is a minor minor point.  Seiko Sports has some awesome designs, I am going to still consider buying a different one.  Maybe one of the green ones or the blue/white one SRPD93.</span>

<span>I'll leave my first review below so you know I'm not just trashing it for fun. When I first bought this I was swinging10-20 seconds a day +or-  certainly not world-ending but not anything to be proud of. Now I am noticing when I put any centrifugal force like jogging or otherwise put it through very modest dynamic motions it will slip 30 seconds or more. Utter garbage and sekio should be ashamed. Also, this is not a Japanese made watch which makes me question its authenticity.  I see these listed on the sekio website and it clearly has made in Japan on the bottom of the face. Mine does not have the country of manufacture listed anywhere on it.  From now on I will not be buying watches on amazon and I recommend you do the same. buy from a reputable licensed dealer and avoid the grey market altogether.<br/><br/>(first review)<br/>So, I won't bash this watch too hard. for what you pay its not an awful watch... Not good either.<br/>Looks gorgeous, You feel the weight on your wrist which I like. I haven't put it through hard use yet but it will likely take a beating.<br/><br/>Flaws... I'm am losing about 7-10 seconds a day. From what I understand these new Seikos are made in china now and it shows. There is the exact same watch that is on several websites that have "made in japan" on the dial. Mine does not and I assume its a lower-tier version of the same watch.<br/><br/>  My advice, for what you'll pay, save up a few more bucks and get a real Seiko made in japan, or even a good entry level swiss piece.</span>

<span>Obviously bought it because of the look and the price. I get compliments pretty regularly on it. Only complaint is it is pretty loud, can't have it sitting on my nightstand at night because the ticking will drive me nuts. Don't regret the purchase at all though.</span>

<span>Great look. Big face. Easy to read. I’m not a fan of the second strap intended to secure the watch on the actual primary band, preventing it to slip. I have a small wrist and in using the securing strap, I got a lot of overage in the band; seemingly it was too long as I had quite a bit of “tongue”. By not using the secondary band, I was able to slide the watch to a position closer to the holes on the band which “shortened” how much was left on the other end (minimal tongue). Solution? I cut off the secondary band. (I applied heat to the end to avoid threading.)  Looks great now. Clean and simple, which is what I wanted.</span>

<span>Nice watch! Ordered this as a gift. It looks great! I was really digging on it so I ordered one for myself. Well I didn't receive a Nate, I received a Machine. I understand mixups happen and they're both Fossil brand watches but not what I ordered. I also ordered a Nate black w/brown face also. Which will be in today... Hopefully it's the one I ordered this time🤞</span>

<span>There is very little to complain about regarding this piece. Typical to the Seiko 5 line, the ever present five characteristics are present here: Day/Date function, water resistance, recessed crown, durable case (but this model has no bracelet) and automatic winding. But the best feature of this watch is the wearability, especially if you have 7" or smaller wrists. With a case of 40mm, 11mm depth, and a lug to lug of less than 45mm, the watch wears smaller than it would suggest when reading the specs. I have the Seiko Sea Urchin desk diver that is 41mm, but with lug to lug of 47mm and a height of 13mm, the watch wears much differently than this one and not in a good way. It's top heavy and cumbersome, especially on a NATO strap whereas this one feels like an extension of your wrist.<br/><br/>If I have two small complaints, the day/date window is in white with black lettering. I wish it was in blue with white lettering to match the dial, but that's a nitpick. Also, the supplied NATO strap is not the best in the world. I would suggest replacing the strap. This watch should be a strap monster and would probably work well with multiple options which would allow the watch to transform from casual to dressy pretty easily.<br/><br/>When I received my watch it was running about 10 seconds fast per minute. It's a common problem with some Seiko 5's. A quick tap of the watch from behind and on the side opposite the crown will release the hairspring from the production pin and get the watch on the right cadence. It's been great every since.<br/><br/>Can't recommend this one enough as a daily wearer. You get a ton of watch at this price point.</span>

<span>This watch is amazing to look at.  How the blue face shines in the light to the silver case.  Accuracy is a little fast about a min off after a week and a half for me.  Overall solid purchase for automatic watch.  Still debating what watch strap to buy.</span>
