<span>My Tissot was defective. I had some suspicions on it's authenticity, but believe it was genuine. The problem was the date window. The date on a watch of this caliber should change just before or just after midnight. Mine was changing at 9:40 PM, and it was a quick change, since this watch is NOT mechanical. No excuse for what I paid for it. In addition, I think it looked like it was returned, and was re sold to me. The original box had scotch tape to hold the inner and outer boxes together. It was not manufacturers tape. The box itself was on the outside " worn or tattered " Obviously, it had seen better days. I returned it. I also would like to say I know how to set the time and date. Any watch should not be date adjusted from 10 PM to 2 AM. I have read that over and over. I have 10 watches in my collection, and this one looked better in the Amazon pictures, than in person. Generally, it's the opposite. There was also some dust under the dome, which was clearly seen. It had to go back.</span>

<span>So I bought this watch recently, and I wear it all the time.. Didn't notice it's in police colors but I guess if I get pulled over , it's a great conversation starter. Im very happy with it and it exceeds my expectations of owning it. Unlike some watches that unstrap from your wrist, this watch is disengaged by pressing some tabs on the side...and that's pretty cool. It doesn't weigh too much and has an elegant display in white and rose gold...24 years ago when I first encountered fossil...they tended to be the silver metallic versions that my friends wore...so this is much more state of the art and futuristic to show off. It seems like it would appeal to a wide variety of people, and that's what I mostly like about it.</span>

Black dial. Silver-tone stainless steel case with a black canvas band. Automatic movement. 30 meters / 100 feet water resistance. Fixed bezel. Tang clasp. Case size 37 mm x 11 mm. Seiko SNK809 Seiko 5 Watch.   The Seiko 5 Men's Automatic Black Strap Black Dial Watch is a stylish timepiece with the convenience of automatic movement. A uniquely designed, black dial features white Arabic numbers marking the hours on an inner circle and the minutes on an outer circle, while small, bar indexes encircle the dial on an outside minute track. Silver-tone hands with luminous fill make it easy to tell time day or night, and the slim second hand is detailed with a red accent. For added convenience, a day and date display are set at three o'clock. The polished stainless steel case extends to meet the black nylon strap, which wraps comfortably around the wrist and fastens with a traditional buckle. Water resistant to 30 feet (100 meters), this high-performance watch is perfect for everyday wear.This is an automatic mechanical watch. Automatic watches do not operate on batteries, instead, they are powered automatically by the movement of the wearer’s arm. If the main spring in your automatic watch is not wound sufficiently, timekeeping may become less accurate. In order to maintain accuracy, wear the watch for 8 hours or more per day, or manually wind the main spring by turning the crown. When not in use, automatic watches may be kept charged with an automatic watch winder – a watch storage unit which may be purchased separately.

<span>Automatic watches are usually much more expensive than this one, so I was dubious that it would be high quality and would keep good time. I'm very pleased with it, though. I wear it every day and sometimes I sleep with it on. When I do take it off at night, it hasn't lost any time when I get up in the morning, so you could easily leave it off 6 or 8 hours and it would still be ticking when you get up--as long as you've worn it all day prior. The drawbacks to the watch are relatively minor. There is no quick release button or tab for the nylon band that comes with it, so to remove that band and replace it with a leather one, I had to essentially break the pins holding the band. I even have a special tool that I use for replacing watch bands, and I couldn't get the pins to release the way I think they are supposed to. Not a big deal. I replaced the nylon band with a Ritche band that has the pins built in with a quick release button. Also, the glowing hands don't show up very well the longer the night wears on, but you can still make them out if you really look hard, even after several hours in the dark. Another minor annoyance is that I like to sync my watch with an online time server, but after you start this automatic going, the seconds hand can't be stopped, which makes it difficult to sync with another clock down to the exact  second. I guess at some point, I will have to let the watch come to a stop and then sync it again. Overall I love the watch, though, and it has become my daily wear watch.</span>

<span>Many reviews provide a detailed review of this watch, so I'll keep this pretty general.  I've had mine a week now, and it's averaging +12 seconds/day, which is respectable for this price point.  I expect it to slow down a bit more over the next 3 months as it gets worn in, hopefully settling on something within 10 seconds/day.  Took the watch camping and have wore it all week, it has no scratches anywhere, still looks new.  Lum is great, as I can easily still see the time at 4:30 in the morning without any special effort to "charge" the watch face.  It should be noted that the lum is not very apparent if there's sufficent ambient light, but once in the dark it's very easy to read.  Others have stated that the watch face is small, I disagree.  The watch looks to be standard size to me (~37mm), but if you think a dive watch is normal size, then this probably is not going to be right for you.  My biggest concerns with this watch are the 30 meters water resistence(this rating does not mean you can swim down to 30 meters, it's recommended that you don't swim with the watch at all), and the fact that I have to wear it everyday or it runs out of juice (but that's automatics for you, nothing unusual about this).  Overall I'm happy with this watch considering it's price point.  If I paid a little more, I might still be happy.  Recommended if you like how it looks, are ok with a normal sized watch, understand that automatics aren't super accurate (but you still want one anyway because they're just cool), don't plan to swim or shower with it on, and you plan to wear it daily.  If you just like how it looks, but want something more accurate with better water resistence and with less worry about it running out of power, look into the Citizen Eco-drive line of watches.  There's one very similar looking to this one, at a moderately higher price.  I considered the Citizen, but liked the idea of an automatic.<br/><br/>Edited to add:  I've had this watch for a few months now, and I'm still happy with my purchase.  No scratches on the watch at all yet.  I reset it each month, setting it ~2 minutes slow, but the end of the month it's usually ~2 minutes fast.  It's seems to run run about 8 seconds fast per day, which is great for an auto this inexpensive.  Overall, I'm still very happy with this watch.  I've really come to appreciate the fact that the lum lasts throughout the evening.  And even though I've taken it off for 12+ hours at a time, I've not yet had it stop on me as some reviewers have indicated has happened to them.<br/><br/>Edited to add (11/28/12): I've had this watch for ~8 months now and I've been wearing it nearly everyday. I have a single light scratch on the face, but nothing horrible, the rest of the watch still looks perfect. I did take the watch off for a 24 hour period, and it did end up stopping on me, but other than that one time it hasn't been an issue.  I'm still amazed by how bright the dial glows at 3 AM in the morning (and having just had a kid, I am up at that time frequently). I've also noticed that I've only had to reset the watch a couple times over the last couple months to keep it within two minutes of the actual time. When comparing the watch to the offical US time, it appears I'm gaining about 5 seconds per day (based on a 3-day average), which is about as good as anyone can ask for from an auto. Overall I'm still very happy.<br/><br/>ETA (10/28/13): Still love this watch. The face seems to be very good at resisting scratches. So far I have not had any additional scratches on the face of the watch, although I do have a few scratches on the case now. Nothing I can't live with, I could even clean those out by buffing the entire case with a dremel, but that would ultimately remove the bead blasted finish (still would look great though, might do that in another year or so). I haven't been tracking the time keeping ability of the watch recently, but I almost never have to reset the time, it's close enough to perfect that the only times I can remember changing it recently were when I was resetting the date at the beginning of the month. Still very happy with this watch.<br/><br/>ETA (7/7/14): The watch continues to perform well. I've worn it daily since receiving it, and it still looks pretty good. No significant wear since my last update, face still looks very good and case has some minor scratches. The time keeping hasn't remained as good as I had hoped, but it's not bad. It runs about 5 minutes fast every two weeks. I just set it 2 minutes slow each time, and I'm never more than a few minutes off over the course of the 2 weeks.<br/><br/>ETA (11/6/17): The watch still functions, but has taken a backseat to a newer citizen eco-drive of similar style. It still looks great, but the time keeping started slipping a bit, sometimes with wild fluctuations. I still wear it from time to time, but it'll never be my primary watch again. Had a really good run though, and I continue to recommend.</span>

<span>Review of the Seiko 5 SNK809:<br/><br/>TOO LONG DIDN'T READ: This watch is great. It runs perfectly 2 years later (I wore it daily for 1 year) and has no issues. It has an accurate movement and is durable. If I were you, I'd go ahead and buy it now. The only downsides of purchasing this watch is that its lume fades pretty fast and the strap is a bit uncomfortable but it's easily resolved by buying a new strap.<br/><br/>Info on photos: The strap pictured was purchased for 5 dollars from Sears a few weeks after purchasing the watch. It’s a major upgrade and I urge you to purchase a new strap for the watch since the one it comes with isnt low quality at all but it was slightly uncomfortable and I wanted the watch to look more formal.<br/><br/>I purchased this watch on July 21, 2018. It arrived in three days and there are other reviews saying this watch gets delivered extremely fast. Hence I doubt you should pay extra for fast shipping, just go with the free shipping that comes with this watch. Before I start this review I want you to keep a few things in mind:<br/><br/>1. This watch costs 64 dollars from an unauthorized dealer (like Amazon) but it will cost you 195 dollars to buy this watch from an Authorized dealer (like Macy’s or Jcpenney).<br/><br/>2. This watch has the 7s26c automatic movement from Seiko<br/><br/>3. This watch is made in Malaysia<br/><br/>4. This watch is 37 mm in diameter<br/><br/>5. This watch doesn’t have hacking or hand winding<br/><br/>I will now start the review:<br/><br/>INTRO:<br/>Let me tell you. This watch is perfect on the exterior. I have scoured every crevice and curve in this watch and not found a single manufacturing defect. This watch has a bead blasted finish on the visible portions when wearing the watch but has a polished finish to the area between the lugs and the case back. This watch is the best automatic watch under 100 dollars that you can trust. If you are looking for a Winner watch. Please do not buy that cheap stuff. The only reason I could see someone buying a Winner watch is to take out the movement to play with. Buy at least a Timex. Although if you really want an automatic watch this one of the best choices under 200 dollars easily.<br/><br/>WHAT ELSE I WANTED<br/>I really wanted a Hamilton Khaki Field Automatic 38mm watch before buying this watch. Eventually I decided against spending the 575 dollars the Swiss Hamilton would set me back by and bought this watch. It was because I did not think I would enjoy wearing the Hamilton every day. It being a 575 dollar watch I would look after it too much. I would not wear it while doing stuff outside because of the possibility it could get scratched. It would be no fun to buy a watch you can't even wear without worry. That is what this watch IS. This is a watch that you can wear everywhere. This watch has Seiko’s Incabloc shock protection on the balance wheel so you do not need to worry about the ruggedness.<br/><br/>MOVEMENT:<br/>How is the movement you ask? The movement on the Seiko SNK809 is the Seiko 7s26C. There may be people complaining about the quality of the movement, but let me tell you: this movement is a very rugged trustable movement. Seiko says this watch has a functioning accuracy of -20 to +40 seconds. I have had my watch for almost a week and my current accuracy on this movement is +1.8 seconds. +1.8 seconds is even within Rolex’s “Superlative Chronometer Status” (+/- 2 seconds per day).  As for shock resistance and ruggedness I have rode my bike on mountain trails whilst having this watch in my wrist and it hasn't stopped.<br/><br/> (To check the accuracy of your watch what I would recommend you do is go to Toolwatch.io or download their app. It is a free tool that will let you check the accuracy of your watch.)<br/><br/>LUME:<br/><br/>The lume on this watch will fade very fast.<br/><br/>TWO YEAR OWNERSHIP UPDATE (May 24 2020)<br/><br/>I kinda gave up on writing a super detailed review but what I can tell you is this watch still runs with the same accuracy it did two years ago (+2.1 sec/day) and its date and day functions all work perfectly. Quick date setting works great too. I purchased a more comfortable leather strap for the watch (It needs an 18mm sized one) and I have 0 complaints. This was the first mechanical watch for my collection back in 2018 and now I have expanded my collection to vintage watches and more higher end timepieces. This watch performs perfectly and is impeccable quality. I wore it daily for the first year of ownership and it never let me down. Its movement may not be pretty but it's really accurate and a workhorse. It's one of my favorite watches in my collection still and I wear it multiple times a week. You cannot go wrong with this watch for the price. It was 64 dollars when I bought it and if its price was 100 I'd still buy it. If you're still considering buying this watch, go for it. The seller has fast shipping and the watchbox came in perfect condition. Good luck!</span>

<span>I have been wearing this watch for a little more than a week now, so this initial review will be based on that, I will try to remember to update this after a month and conclude what I really think of this watch.<br/><br/>So far my initial impression of the watch is good. When I first handled it, I was impressed by the heft and finish of the case. It is very solid, no strange, gaping seams or jagged edges that taint it's perfect roundness. I noticed that the second hand was already running, this is because you can't "hack" the watch when you are adjusting the minute hand. The hands are easily read because of the contrast of it's white against the black face. The inner bezel surrounding the watch face is polished and has a nice reflection which adds to the shape. If it weren't for that bezel, I think it would look very dull.<br/><br/>Many people complain about the size of the watch, but in it's defense the measurements are stated upfront. There should not have been any other expectations. But it does look smaller than stated. This is probably due to the face/outter bezel ratio. The outter bezel is about 3.5mm which leaves the face and inner bezel to have a diameter of about 30mm.<br/><br/>The face is very clear and easy to read thanks to the white on black combination as well as the hardlex crystal. The product photo doesn't do the watch much justice because in person, the black dial is a very rich black. The lume isn't that impressive. In a regular situation, the lume will probably not be charged enough to really notice in a dim/dark room. But for testing purposes, I charged it up with a flashlight. The lume will probably last about 10 minutes till it diminishes.<br/><br/>Setting the watch was fairly simple. The crown is a little difficult to handle because of its position in the case. But even when it has been lifted, the increments from the first position to the second position is very small. The firmness of the crown makes it a little difficult to determine which position you are in. Setting the date looked like a troubling task to some of the other reviewers, but it wasn't hard to figure out. When in the 2nd crown position, you rotate the crown clockwise(upward) to change the day and counter-clockwise(downward) to change the date. I hear from other forums to avoid doing this between 9PM and 3AM since the day/date starts to turn between those hours and adjusting it might cause some issues.<br/><br/>The strap that was supplied didn't impress me much at first. Sometimes it would look really deep black, and sometimes it just looks ragged depending on the light. The length is substantial, I am sure it can accommodate most people wearing this watch. I have thin wrist and it looks great on me. But since it is longer, the end of the strap is left to protrude a little more than I prefer. It also is a little coarse. It isn't uncomfortable, but looks like it would be. Which, in some cases, could be worse. I was willing to tolerate this but thought, if this is a watch I want to wear everyday, I will probably change it out to something nicer. I ordered a black leather band to compliment the face of the watch.<br/><br/>As far as accuracy, the first couple days fluctuated from +1 to +5. Which isn't bad at all. But it wasn't consistent. So I looked into it a little bit. During regular wear, sitting at my computer, driving, etc., it would maybe gain 1 second or less by the end of the day. I check periodically against my phone's clock. but one night, I decided to wind it up aggressively, and realized by doing so, it gained about 6 seconds over 2-3 hours. So my conclusion to that was not to aggressively wind it and just let it wind through regular wear. The first few nights I let it rest on it's back and found that by the next morning, it gained 5 seconds. I reset it back for testing purposes and tried leaving it in a different position the following night. And to my surprise, it didn't gain any noticeable time at all. If there was any time drift at all it might have been a -.25second change. So aside from the initial +1 to +5 gain it naturally has, I was able to find a way to keep it even more accurate.<br/><br/>TIP: Try leaving it in different positions overnight if you don't plan to sleep with it on. I read some people have luck resting it faced down. But for me it was to have it set perpendicular with the 6 positioned down.<br/><br/>UPDATE: It has been about a month since I have been wearing this watch day-to-day. I have to really express how impressed I am of the quality. The case is very durable and the crystal is still spotless. Not to say that I have been crawling through mud or rock climbing with it on or anything. But from my everyday activities, normal office type work, and just running errands throughout the day, the watch has probably been bumped and grazed a few times and has not left any marks.<br/><br/>As for the time drifting, my initial observations are still true. In my case, leaving the watch face up will gain a few seconds overnight. Leaving it upright will lose less than a second. And just throughout the day, it might gain/lose a second. This is considered to be VERY accurate. My results may differ from others.<br/><br/>I got rid of the strap it came with in favor of a light weight resin strap instead. The original canvas strap was not comfortable and held water. The resin strap made this watch more tolerable and easier to dry after washing my hands. I inadvertently tested the water resistance from a couple quick splashes, held up nicely.<br/><br/>The only thing that still bugs me about the watch, and this may be true to all automatics but I will state it anyway, is that the winding noise is very present and makes the watch seem imperfect. But that does not affect my admiration for the watch. I enjoy wearing this watch everyday.<br/><br/>Update: It's been about two years since I've owned this and the accuracy is pretty far off. I haven't worn it much lately but still have it in my rotation of watches. It gains about 2 minutes a day now. Might be due for some maintenance.</span>

<span>This is the second timex watch I’ve own, I screwed up the first one putting a battery in it. I originally purchased this watch for work. For $40 dollars these are some the toughest watches out. I’ve spent twice the money on watches that didn’t last a year.</span>

<span>This wrist watch is exactly what I wanted. I’ve only had it for a few weeks but it keeps perfect time so far, to the second, and the light works perfectly. It has a larger face than the previous watch I had, which is a great attribute. I had my previous watch for at least 25 years, but with age I need a light on my watch now at night. This light works great. I had been reviewing this watch for a few months and suddenly saw the price cut in half, so I bought it. I recommend it to anyone looking for a watch with these features.</span>

<span>I bought this watch specifically for a camping trip because I wanted something classy that could still stand up to adventure. For a month, this watch held up against anything I threw at it: ATV'ing in the mountains, playing in sand at the beach, light swimming and frequent grilling / campfires. During my last trip, I noticed the time slowly began to lose minutes.<br/><br/>First it was a little slow by seconds, then after a week it lost minutes, now it's an hour slow two weeks later. After running a timed experiment, it loses about 2 minutes a day. I absolutely love this watch and it's being shipped back to Timex for repair. I know this isn't a high end time piece but I've always had faith in Timex and I hope they deliver. If they can fix the loss issue, I'll edit this review to 5 stars.</span>

<span>An inexpensive alternative to the discontinued Seiko style I wore for over 50yrs.  Clean, attractive, FUNCTIONAL.<br/>Time is easy to read in daylight.  Luminous hands glow faintly all night long, but Timex didn't make hour markers luminous, so the only way to be certain of the time in the dark is to use the "Indiglow" feature (draining battery).<br/>Date too tiny to read, but that's not a dealbreaker for me.<br/>Would have preferred a rubber or metal strap to leather (durability &amp; waterproof).<br/>  UPDATE: when removing the watch (3rd time!), the buckle popped off.  It uses a spring-pin, so I was able, with some difficulty, re-attach it.  But this could obviously happen again &amp; again &amp; again, to me &amp; to others.  CRAP design.  Now I'll have to search out a replacement.<br/>And would love a optional protective 'cage' over the crystal (I'm somehow inclined to break these).<br/>Haven't tested water resistance.</span>

<span>It's been years since I've owned a wrist watch. With the smart phone available all the time I didn't really need one. I'm here to say I was wrong. After many years I began to figure how much easier it was to look down at your wrist than pulling out your phone, turning it on, checking the time and putting it away. Even using SIRI to tell you the time wasn't as fast, maybe a bit amusing but no faster. I wasn't even looking for a watch to be honest with you. It was a Amazons mobile app suggestion which I ignored the first time. The second time I decided to take a look at the description but after seeing the price decided not to order. The next time I thought about the watch I added it to my wish list. The day I ordered my watch was because of a huge price drop. So now I own a watch again. For some reason I keep looking at my wrist about every minute or so. I know it's new and since I haven't worn one for awhile it's going to take some time to get use to it I guess. Now to be clear here, I'm only going to use the watch to tell the time. I'll still be using my phone for alarms, timing things and appointment reminders. Though I know the watch has many features and maybe some day I'll attempt to use them right now it's a great watch. The watch looks great on by the way and the first time I wore it I was complimented on how nice the watch looked. I truly believe people aren't use to seeing wrist watches any longer. I give this a four star review because I wish the buttons were just a tad bigger. I'm sure the average user will have no problems with them. In my case I suffer from Parkinson's disease and the hands shake a bit. Gee, someday maybe someone will design a smart watch. LOL.<br/><br/>This review was written without any financial considerations. Full Amazo retail was paid. If you think the review helped please say so.</span>

"While it looks like a casual watch, the full-sized Timex Men's T40051 Expedition Metal Field Brown Leather Strap Watch adds a stylish yet rugged complement to your everyday wear. It features a large, round silver-tone brass watch case with a flattened, brushed bezel that frames an olive green dial background with Arabic numerals, inset 24-hour notations, large, luminous stick hands (with seconds hand), and a date display at 3 o'clock. With the Quick Date function, you can set the date on the watch without turning the crown for every 24-hour period. Just pull the stem halfway out, and turn until desired date is reached. It also offers an 8-year battery life, water resistance to 165 feet (50 meters), and a durable genuine leather strap. The Indiglo night-light uniformly lights the surface of the watch dial using patented blue electroluminescent lighting technology. It uses less battery power than most other watch illumination systems, enabling your watch battery to last longer."

<span>I’m a woman who occasionally buys men’s watches because  I like the style of outdoor, or field, watches. I’ve found Timex watches’ Indiglo feature convenient, and overall to be a good value. Especially as a woman with average wrists, I was surprised the strap on the new Expedition is almost too short to look good. It fits best on the second-to-last hole. The watch face is also definitely smaller than the last Timex Expedition I bought, and the ticking is louder. (It’s not bothersome.) The watch strap is more of a padded suede than a straight-up leather watch. All that said, I’ll still buy Timex watches. They’re reliable and the price is right. I’ll keep this one but shop for a longer, solid leather band for it.</span>

<span>This is a nice watch, with a solid feel, nice, clear detailing, and a lovely matte finish to its case.  Definitely a good value for dollar, especially compared to a lot of other brands / sources.  The orange second hand is distinctive, and the hands and blue coloring are classy, as is the understated branding:  A nice difference from many watches, especially chea... "economical" brands that put their brand in giant, distracting, tacky logos, etc.  And, in an unexpectedly hard to find twist, there is no date window, which is _terrific_, if you only rarely wear a watch, as I do... I have been hunting specifically for a simple, date-less, fairly rugged watch to wear from time to time but that I wouldn't have to fiddle with to reset a date, every time I put it on, the once-per-month or so that I do.<br/><br/>BUT.<br/><br/>I apparently am alone in *not* wanting a giant clock on my wrist.  Which is ironic, as i am a freakishly tall guy... I just have thin arms/wrists, and big watches look silly on me (to me, your style may vary) and I find them annoying and clunky to wear.<br/><br/>The specs on this one are 40mm, and that's on the smaller side of watches these days, unfortunately, unless you jump down to a "ladies" watch at 32mm or below.  I took a chance on this one, thinking it might be small enough.<br/><br/>It is larger than the 40mm vintage Citizen diver I have, by 1-2 mm.  And, because of the design (all face, no bezel, and thick/rugged case) it "wears" even bigger than that.  It really is hard to call this one 40mm, so if you're on the fence, don't think "maybe it'll be small enough."  Not to take away from the watch, but it's annoying.  It would help a LOT if photos included a comparison grid, a quarter, anything, honestly.<br/><br/>Unfortunately for me, it's bigger than I hoped.  My only point in reviewing it here is that maybe, maybe, you're like me and have been hunting, frustrated, for a while, and are settling into "maybe 40mm will work" or "40mm is not THAT big"... just be advised that this one is slightly bigger than that, and wears bigger still.<br/><br/>I changed it to a thin NATO strap, which did help.  Not that the original strap is bad by any means! -- it's just thicker and adds bulk.  It helped to change down to a light/tan thin-pleather strap, but it still looks big.<br/><br/>It's a nice watch.  If you have big forearms, or like a large watch, ya' can't go wrong.  I may get used to it, but for now, it bugs me every time I put it on.  It'll probably wind up relegated to the Box Of Too Big Watches, but we'll see.<br/><br/>I'm knocking off a star because the measurements are likely a bit off, and if you look closely, it's quite obvious that the orange second hand is slightly misaligned with the marks on the dial, which is annoying.  And the numerals on the face are clumsy/inelegant in their print, which really is only obvious because they're SO big.  Not bad, certainly, for a $notmuch watch, but five stars have to be _earned_. : )<br/><br/>If anyone knows of a similarly priced (or thereabouts, keeping it under a Benjamin) dive-style watch without a date window, with 100m or more water resistance, with a blue face, at 36ish mm, leave a comment!  My hunt continues.... I pro'ly have to learn how to mod/build something, don't I?<br/><br/>Good luck with your hunt.  This is a nice watch, especially for the price, though the water resistance might be a little lower than the rugged-look might promise.  Definitely a bargain, if the size isn't an issue for you!</span>

  CasioWith the launch of its first watch in November 1974, Casio entered the wristwatch market at a time when the watch industry had just discovered digital technology. As a company with cutting-edge electronic technology developed for pocket calculators, Casio entered this field confident that it could develop timepieces that would lead the market.Today, Casio is focusing its efforts on solar-powered radio-controlled watches: the built-in solar battery eliminates the nuisance of replacing batteries, atomic timekeeping means the users never have to reset the time. Recently, Casio launched a series of Bluetooth watches that sync to the users cell phone to automatically update the time. Casio is always moving time forward.  See more

<span>In the 1980s two friends and I vigilantly set our watches to the time signal broadcast on shortwave station WWV. Each of our time pieces had unique hour chimes that chorused in a rapid sequence (beep beep, doot doot, deet deet deet) when we were together. This amazing watch automates the process by listening to the time station and preforming the settings update FOR me.  Each hour when I hear the chime I know I'm getting precise time to the second just like when I was young. I've seen this feature in wall clocks, but never before in a wrist watch.

<span>I first purchased this WV58DA watch in late 2007. Before getting this watch I had been a life-long Timex fan, but I was getting tired of the Timex bands which, even in the Stainless Steel versions, had rubber parts that kept falling apart. I wanted the following features: 100% stainless band, countdown timer, waterproof, EL backlight, and under $50. When I found that I could get all that plus the atomic clock setting feature for less than the Timex I jumped on it. My first WV58DA watch died 28 months later when the plastic case cracked, and I didn't think twice about buying a second one.<br/><br/>Let me start by saying that this is a great watch. I love the automatic time setting feature. Even when I lived in parts of New England that were on the edge of the reception area according to Casio, the watch was still able to set itself on my wrist 80% of the time. I was never able to get a signal on it during the day, but at 3 or 4 am when it automatically sets itself the ionosphere conditions allowed for a strong enough signal. Despite the radio features, the battery on the watch I got in 2007 is still going strong after 3 years -- there is no need to pay twice the price for a solar watch. The watch does have a few downsides compared to the Timexs I've owned, which I will detail below. Despite these downsides, the appearance, build quality, and atomic feature make this WV58DA watch my favorite watch I've ever owned.<br/><br/>The watch it pretty easy to use and set, with nice big buttons. Unlike my Timex, it doesn't allow you to set each digit of the time independently, but the fact that you can adjust the time up AND down almost makes up for it. Since setting the time is automatic, even with Daylight Saving Time changes, this isn't a major issue.<br/><br/>The countdown timer works, but can take slightly longer to set than on the Timex due to the above issue. Annoyingly, the maximum time on the countdown timer is only 60 minutes (99 on the Timex), and you can only set the time in whole minutes (the Timex let you set both minutes and seconds).<br/><br/>Unlike my Timex, the stopwatch isn't a main feature, so there are no labels to indicate which buttons do what in stopwatch mode. There is also no lap mode, and the split function is very limited. However, I never used these features much on my Timex, and don't really miss them here.<br/><br/>The screen and backlight are bright and easy to read and, unlike the Timex, the backlight stays on for a few seconds after you release the button. The one real annoyance is that you cannot use the backlight at all when you are setting anything, including the time, an alarm, or the countdown, since the backlight button doubles as the "adjust backwards" button. Unlike on my Timex there is no "night mode" to turn the backlight on automatically when you press any button.<br/><br/>The dual time zone feature is nice, and here the Casio beats out the Timex because it displays the airport code and UTC offset, making it easy to set the watch while traveling. Also unlike the Timex, it updates both time zones for Daylight Savings Time and it can handle half-hour time zones such as India Standard Time. Unfortunately, the big buttons on the watch mean that I sometimes bump the watch into "world clock" mode accidentally, and until I got used to checking, I missed a few appointments because my watch was in the adjacent time zone (although this happened occasionally with my Timex too). The only real downside compared to the Timex is that you can only set alarms to your primary time zone, not to your "world time" time zone.<br/><br/>Despite these flaws, I would recommend this watch to anyone looking for a "sport" style watch in this price range. The band is top quality (once you get it adjusted), the watch works well, and the atomic feature is awesome.<br/><br/>This watch is also featured in the movie "Non-Stop", where Liam Neeson's character uses it to keep track of deadlines imposed by a hijacker (you can see the watch in the trailers and commercials).</span>

<span>This is a wonderful watch. It’s beautiful and rivals more expensive brands in quality and aesthetics. The whole experience was easy with this seller as I wanted to ensure I received an imported watch from Japan. I had no issues and the whole process was seamless.</span>

<span>I have more than 15 watches and this is my latest acquisition. Looks better in person than in the photos. I like the fact that is heavy. Comes with a tool to adjust the strap. Very easy job.</span>

<span>I really wanted this for myself but I thought of my dad and he deserves it more. So, no two watch can be the same for the son and the father. Yes, I basically said the same thing twice.<br/><br/>Anyway, it does look a bit sporty between the two silver and primary dark tone. But boy how it shines and clash so well with everything. And the style is just so interesting with the shape of the two smaller dial, the top hour stop watch vs the bottom alarm dial, reminds me of the symbolic sign of infinity. it's a great watch and great looking.<br/><br/>Happy buying!</span>

<span>***UPDATED***<br/><br/>First Review:<br/>I recently had a malfunction: the stopwatch function “froze” and I can’t reset or get out of the “time” mode.  I just checked and am beyond the Amazon return window (purchased in May, return window expired in June…it’s now late July).  I’ve read a ton of reviews that say the company doesn’t stand behind their product.  The jury is still out in my case so let’s see how they respond.  I’m not going to mention my occupationS or experience, that is reserved for review #2 after I see how they respond.  For the record, I also own an MC-2 Compass (made by the same company) and it’s world renowned, so I have high hopes they do the right thing.  We shall see, more to come.  July 23, 2022<br/><br/>Review #2 (September 18, 2022):<br/>It’s a good watch!  I’m in Law Enforcement (Highway Patrol &amp; Marine Unit), so I NEEDED a good watch.  This one is hard to read at night (small numbers/characters and low backlight brightness), the included “Quick Guide” (all FOUR of them) only tell a small part of the story of this watch.  To fully understand its capabilities and how to use it effectively, you’ll need that quick guide and all 33-pages of the user manual that you’ll have to download from their website.  When I said “and”, I literally mean you need them BOTH (photo attached) to understand how to use all of the functions because neither does an effective job explaining how the thing works!<br/><br/>I’m my first review I mentioned a malfunction.  Well, it ended up being operator error on my part because I literally didn’t understand that it had gone into locked mode AND I couldn’t see the teeny, tiny little padlock icon that said it was in locked mode!  Did I mention it’s hard to see/read?  That became even more challenging because I had accidentally changed the language to something other than English and what little chance I had to recover was totally gone once it changed to some other language.<br/><br/>If you wear glasses, be sure to use them whenever you’re setting or using anything other than the most basic functions (cycling through date, sunrise/sunset, stopwatch, timer, compass, altimeter, barometer).  The user interface isn’t user-friendly or even intuitive so prepare to start memorizing which buttons perform which function when you’re doing anything other than cycling through available menus.<br/><br/>Again, it’s a good watch…very good even!  I returned it for repair and they promptly returned it with the explanation that I didn’t know how to use it (those are my words, they were much more polite and professional…thanks to them for that!)<br/><br/>I was so frustrated when it was stuck in locked mode that I bought an Ironman (100m waterproof model) on-sale for $39.95.  I can actually read and manipulate its functions at night, without reading glasses and the buttons are ultra-intuitive!!!!  Sure it doesn’t have a compass, altimeter or barometer but for a basic rugged watch you can see (even at night without glasses or a magnifying glass), it’s kinda hard to beat since I swim often and waterproofing really matters.  This Suunto cost $125 on Amazon and it’s a better watch than the Ironman I just mentioned simply because of its highly advanced capabilities.  Just be prepared to do a ton of learning to use it effectively and efficiently in the field!<br/><br/>I give the Suunto Core All Black a solid 4-Stars for quality, aesthetics, capabilities, and durability.  The manual(s), display readability, and intuitive user interface all SUCK but I’m only going to dock them 1-Star for all of those because they should be easily correctable.  …it’s a very good watch!</span>

<span>Watch came very promptly and in good condition.  No User guide enclosed with watch so I had to download it.  My watch was initially set in German so it might be hard for those not knowing German to understand the words on the watch to work through set up.  After I finally worked out the set up for Time/Date, ALT/BAR I moved on to Compass.  Problem...I set the watch to correct declination but it would not calibrate but simple show "start Compass"...Look up the issue online and worked through a few ideas presented and finally got the compass to work...so I give the watch a 4 out of 5 due to poor set up instructions.</span>

<span>I love this watch, industry standard for military dumb watches. However, the temp is pretty useless and is generally not accurate if you're wearing the watch. I bought this in June and now I'm really November the upper left button that starts and stops the stopwatch, pretty important, gets stuck and barely works... Can't seem to see anything stuck in it and sometimes you can get it to pop up and it still doesn't do anything when you depress it... Bit ridiculous for the price... Won't buy again after this training course finishes</span>

<span>I got my first Suunto Core as a gift in 2018. After somewhere around a year, it died &amp; replacing the battery did nothing. I contacted Suunto, they honored the warranty, I sent the dud watch back to them &amp; they sent me a new one. I'm still using it today (2022).<br/><br/>I LOVE the menu setup. It's by far the easiest non-smart watch to set &amp; navigate that I've ever seen. All of it's clock/timer functions work great, but none of it's other functions are very reliable.<br/><br/>On both my original &amp; the replacement, the altimeter is consistently off by anywhere from 20 meters to a KILOMETER, but averaging somewhere in the low 100 meter range. I've tried recalibrating many times. Doesn't seem to make a difference.<br/><br/>The compass was one of the biggest reasons I wanted this watch. An onboard, non-GPS compass was exactly what I was looking for because I enjoy camping &amp; hiking trips &amp; I was working toward a career in law enforcement. Unfortunately, the compass is consistently off by about 15 to 20 degrees. Again, I've tried recalibrating it many times. No change.<br/><br/>Also, as other reviewers have said, it goes through batteries entirely too fast. Since receiving my replacement watch in mid 2020, I have (in late 2022) already had to replace the battery 4 times.<br/><br/>Overall, I'm torn. If this was just a basic digital watch, I'd easily be giving it 5 stars, but because of it's failure to deliver it's other functions, I just can't justify that high of a rating.<br/><br/>Pros:<br/>excellent, user-friendly menu &amp; general opporation<br/>good clock &amp; timer functions<br/>durable design<br/><br/>Cons:<br/>inaccurate compass<br/>VERY inaccurate altimeter/barometer<br/>short battery life</span>
