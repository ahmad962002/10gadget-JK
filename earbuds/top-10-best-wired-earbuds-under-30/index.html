<li><span class="a-list-item"> Unlike traditional, circular earbuds, the design of the EarPods is defined by the geometry of the ear which makes them more comfortable for more people than any other earbud-style headphones  </span></li>
<li><span class="a-list-item"> The speakers inside the EarPods have been engineered to maximize sound output and minimize sound loss, which means you get high-quality audio  </span></li>
<li><span class="a-list-item"> The EarPods also include a built-in remote that lets you adjust the volume, control the playback of music and video, and answer or end calls with a pinch of the cord  </span></li>
<li><span class="a-list-item"> The remote and mic are supported by all models of iPod, iPhone, and iPad (not all models support volume up/down functions). Audio is supported by all iPod models. Requires software version 1.0.3 for iPod nano (4th generation), 2.0.1 for iPod classic (120GB), and 2.2 or later for iPod touch (2nd generation).  </span></li>

<div class="slideshow-container">
<blockquote><em><div class="a-row a-spacing-small review-data"><span class="a-size-base review-text review-text-content" data-hook="review-body">
<span>This is a classic design and sound quality. Solid. The best thing about it is it doesn't have rubber tips that go down deeper in the ear so your ears will not sweat as much (if you have that problem) and let's build up of ear wax. I use it on a smartphone without a headphone jack, but I bought a quality dongle from Amazon and the combo works perfect.</span>
</span></div></em></blockquote>
<p> </p>
<blockquote><em><div class="a-row a-spacing-small review-data"><span class="a-size-base review-text review-text-content" data-hook="review-body">
<span>I've gone through a lot of earbuds over the years, and a lot of them usually last one or two months due to how cheap they are. These, however, have lasted me an average of 3 years. I usually don't like to buy Apple products nowadays, but I consider these an exception since they actually work well.</span>
</span></div></em></blockquote>
<p> </p>
<blockquote><em><div class="a-row a-spacing-small review-data"><span class="a-size-base review-text review-text-content" data-hook="review-body">
<span>Sound quality is good enough for me. Bass is good. Overall sound quality is really full. I've bought Apple ear buds for years. They obviously work well with my iPod Nano, but in recent months, they also work perfectly with my Android phone. They're not as good as higher end ear buds when it comes to noise cancellation, but they're really quality for their price. They're comfortable, too. I used to wear them for ten hour shifts at work.</span>
</span></div></em></blockquote>
<p> </p>
<blockquote><em><div class="a-row a-spacing-small review-data"><span class="a-size-base review-text review-text-content" data-hook="review-body">
<span>I had to get these as a backup and they work just fine. It’s good that they are Apple certified product and I have been happy with how they work. I recommend them as a backup if your AirPods get lost or stolen. Plus, they are more affordable choice. Great for exercise and travel.</span>

<span>UPDATE July 2 2017:<br/>At some point, I ended up using these as my primary headphones. After adjusting to them, they are actually very comfortable. The first several times I wore them (see my original review, below) they weren't that comfortable but I evidently didn't give them enough of a chance.<br/><br/>1. They are very comfortable to wear even over long periods of time. I use them as my headphones for all day at work and they don't bother my ears.<br/>2. They stay in just fine working, walking, etc. I haven't tried them while jogging but I've yet to have much issue with them falling out or coming too loose.<br/>3. The sound is great for the price. It's not "Bose" or anything obviously, but the sound is much better than my Coby earbuds and roughly equivalent to my SoundBot. In short, it's balanced and clear without sounding super bass-y nor tinny.<br/>4. I've just learned today that they are very durable! I was looking all over for them and couldn't find them so I just used some other headphones and what do you know - I had tucked them in a shirt pocket and accidentally washed (and dried) them! I thought for sure they were done for. The cable even felt a little bit softer, but nope! I plugged them into my laptop and started up a video and they still worked. They didn't sound any different than before I washed(!) them. They were very tangled but I can live with that.<br/><br/>Overall, I would highly recommend these headphones now after giving them more of a chance myself. And, if you're like I was initially, try giving your ears a little more time to adjust.<br/><br/>ORIGINAL REVIEW (November 2015):<br/>I read several reviews before buying these and got intrigued. My ears are small or shaped weird - especially my left one. I don't know what it is but I have never found ear buds comfortable. The original kind that have a Hershey Kiss speaker shape that goes in your ear - those are the worst. The soft in-ear kind are significantly better, but still not comfortable to me and they have a tendency to fall out. I prefer regular over the ear headphones but those aren't so acceptable at work.<br/><br/>I bought a pair of SoundBot headphones that were super comfy, but after awhile the left side broke. It still works, but jiggling the wire pauses songs, skips songs, and even turns the volume up or down (which there isn't actually a control on the headphones for). Wanting to find a replacement (and not be locked in to one specific brand of style), I tried these.<br/><br/>For starters, they are cute. I mean, for ear buds. The blue is a pretty blue, it is a bit brighter than say, royal/Superman blue.<br/><br/>Also, they do actually stay in my ears pretty well. The ear piece sort of hooks into the shape of your ear in a similar manner as the SoundBot ones, locking it in place. It isn't stuck in there however, and still relies a bit on the shove-it-in-your-ear factor.<br/><br/>The cord is decently long, a comfortable length in my opinion. However, it is thin. I feel like it could easily have a similar problem within a few months if I don't take extra good care of them. That said, there is no control for anything on these headphones so hopefully if it started getting damaged, it would have no effect.<br/><br/>The sound is very good, especially for the price. I have a pair of cheap, Coby ear buds and the sound quality on those is noticeably lower than any others I have tried - so these are better than that, at least. These I would say are a notch below my SoundBot headphones and a few notches above the Coby. I would say my SoundBot headphones are about on par with my original Galaxy S5 headphones for sound quality,  if that helps.<br/><br/>One thing I dislike is that I can easily hear background noise through these headphones. It isn't crystal clear, but in a noisy office, I find myself having to turn the volume up further. It isn't to say that they are SUPPOSED to have noise-cancel, but I got used to it with my Galaxy S5 headphones and especially with my SoundBot ones. Galaxy S5 headphones block out the majority of background noise, and the SoundBot ones block out all but the loudest. Even without anything playing, they have a noise-cancel effect.<br/><br/>OK, now for my primary complaint. All other factors the same, I would be very satisfied with these headphones if they were only more comfortable. It's strange, too, because on the right ear it's perfect. On the left ear, painful. I have avoided using my Galaxy S5 headphones because they aren't so comfortable to me, but I actually practically retired these ones in favor of those. I don't know what it is about my left ear. I tried switching the medium/default tip for the smallest and I might say that's even less comfortable? I can't quite put my finger on it. The speaker hole is narrower - it's an oval, not a circle, giving almost an appearance like the latest iPhone headphones. I thought that would have been perfect, and it is on my right ear. My right ear could probably wear it all day, but my left ear can't stand it.<br/><br/>So, I know I have talked most this review about my broken SoundBot headphones, but that's only because they are the most comfortable ear buds I have ever found. For me, comfort takes precedence over pretty much all other features (save for price) because I just can't stand wearing most ear buds. That said, here is the fib ranking:<br/><br/>Sound Quality:<br/>1st/2nd: Galaxy S5 and SoundBot (tie)<br/>3rd: These Panasonic headphones<br/>4th: Coby<br/><br/>Comfort:<br/>1st: SoundBot<br/>2nd: Galaxy S5<br/>3rd: These Panasonic headphones<br/>4th: Coby<br/><br/>Appearance:<br/>1st: These Panasonic headphones<br/>2nd: Galaxy S5<br/>3rd: Coby<br/>4th: SoundBot<br/><br/>Price:<br/>1st: These Panasonic headphones<br/>2nd: SoundBot (by a few dollars)<br/>(I can't rank the Galaxy S5 because they can with my phone and the Coby came as part of a set with other headphones)<br/><br/>Features/Functionality:<br/>1st: Galaxy S5 (play/pause/skip/phone and volume)<br/>2nd: SoundBot (play/pause/skip/phone)<br/>3rd/4th: These Panasonic headphones and Coby (tie - no controls)<br/><br/>Overall, if my left ear wasn't so sensitive I would probably love these. Because it is so sensitive, I find them almost unusable. Otherwise, for the price and general quality, I would recommend them for less finicky ears.</span>

<span>Of course what sounds good is very subjective, so just because I am very pleased with these does not mean you will be....<br/><br/>In the past I have been pleasently surprised by the sound quality of Panasonic headphones.  I was therefore hoping these would be much better than the price would suggest.<br/><br/>These earbuds did not let me down.  They sound great.  The highs and mids are clear and the bass sounds natural; that is, the bass is not weak or overpowering, and is not muddy or thumpy.<br/><br/>Better still, they fit in my ears!! They are comfortable, secure (don't feel like they are going to slip out), and do a very good job of blocking (not cancelling) ambient sounds and noise.  This is a pleasent added surprise for me as most earbuds I have tried did not fit securely nor comfortably.<br/><br/>I do not care for earbuds.  I much prefer closed ear headphones but there are times when I must use earbuds instead.  I would never spend a lot for earbuds but I want value for what I do pay.<br/><br/>These Panasonic earbuds deliver a lot of value for the price.  Even if I had paid more for them I would not be disappointed!</span>

<span>The janitor recently stole the pair of Skullcandies I usually left at work.  I wanted a good music listening pair to replace them.  I recently bought several "cheapish" ear buds, one 20 dollar set, and a set of JVC flat headphones recently.  I couldn't decide based on reviews alone, so tried several different options.  I know it was silly.  I should have just spent it all on one "nice" pair, but I thought it would be fun, and it actually was.  Besides, why give the Janitor such a big target.  ;p  I also discovered different roles for the buds I bought.  They nearly all have a place in my collection.  :]  Win win.<br/><br/>I'm no audiophile, or sound professional.  Evenso, I bet I'm like a lot of you.  I want nice sounding music to accompany my day while quieting the environment.  I hope these comparisons will be helpful so you don't have to buy a bundle of buds, and can maybe zero in on a set or two that will serve your tastes best.  I enjoyed comparing and contrasting, and actually noting quit a bit of difference.<br/><br/>The buds/phones I tried are<br/><br/>iLuv iEP322ORG [orange] in-ear Ultra Bass ~6 dollars<br/>Panasonic RPHJE120K [black] in-ear ~6 dollars<br/>Yamaha EPH-20Bu [supposedly blue but actually purple] in- ear ~20 dollars<br/>JVC 10HAFC earphones ~3 dollars<br/>JVC "Flats" on ear headphones black ~12<br/>Skullycandy "Ink'd" in ear buds ~15 [already owned, but in for comparison]<br/>Sentry Wind-Ups in-ear buds ~5 dollars<br/><br/>iLuv:<br/>I chose the orange iLuv's because it was the cheapest color on Amazon.  I enjoyed their sound overall.  They are the most bass heavy of the group.  However, they leave the highs and mids a little neglected.  They also reduce ambient sound decently, so you can focus on what you are listening to.  So while these are not the most balanced, your teen will probably love the sound.  They are also on the "loud" side.  Even at minimum device volume these came in the loudest.  As such, I will probably put these in with one of my DS systems' carrying cases.  It will be great for those, and be on hand so I won't have to scrounge around for a pair, when I want to hear the game and not my wife's TV programs.  These also won't be my work or walking pair, because they don't look very adult [again, your teen will probably love them], and they produce the second most "cord noise" in the group from the cords rubbing on your shoulders or clothes while you are walking or exercising.  If I had nothing else to compare to, I think I'd have been very happy with this set.<br/><br/>Panasonic:<br/>The Panasonics were probably the quietest of the group.  Sound is relatively balanced, with no real extremes.  Bass seems light for an in ear bud.  They are now my go to bed buds.  I can put my device on minimum volume and easily go to sleep.  The iLuvs and Skullcandy were too loud to be comfortable on both my phone media player and iPad mini's lowest setting for sleeping.  The Panasonics are also small enough, that they weren't uncomfortable for side sleeping.  These also produced the least cord noise from movement, so should be good to walk, exercise in.  Noise reduction was decent and reduced my wife's snoring several decibels.  This might not be so great for outdoor exercise, where you may want to hear your environment for safety.  I may even get a second set or carry mine back and forth so I can walk at lunch break in these, since I have a protected area to walk [no cars, etc.].  The lack of cord noise really makes the difference here.<br/><br/>Yamaha:<br/>I was curious about what I would get by going a little upmarket.  Granted it's not much of a jump at "only" 20 dollars.  The Yamahas were probably most similar in sound to the Panasonics or JVC flats.  They had a good all around balance and were more full than the Panasonics.  Bass is not prominent, nor is it missing.  They sound best with Classical music in my experience.  On the down side, they were advertised as "blue", but Yamaha's idea of blue is very clearly Purple.  It's not a major issue, but be aware, if you choose this color.  Cord noise seemed on the loud side, compared to the JVC buds and Panasonics.  I probably would not want to do anything active in them.  However, if I could "only" have one bud, this might be it.<br/><br/>JVC HAF10C earbuds:<br/>For only around 3 dollars you shouldn't normally expect too much.  Agree?  Well, I already had a blue pair [ 4 dollars at retail] so knew what to expect.  It's a testament I bought another.  This pair was black, and I far prefer the gorgeous blue plastic set, but would not pay a couple extra dollars on Amazon for that choice.  I know it shouldn't matter, but I REALLY like blues.  Anyhow, the most unique feature of this set is the clamshell case you get.  It allows you to wind your cord and protect the buds.  I wish higher quality buds would do this.  I'd pay a couple extra bucks for it.  The case does not work well for most in-ear buds, I would guess.  I am able to get the above Yamahas in one case [why I ordered an extra set], but it is not a perfect fit.  Larger buds probably won't fit.  The buds themsevles have a durable hard plastic casing and should be quite durable.  Sound is actually nice, for non-in ear buds.  For the price I doubt you'd find better sound.  They are also on the quiet side, and not being directly in ear, you could probably give these to your kids without the threat of hearing damage you might get from louder and in ear buds.  I use these to walk, talk radio, and some music.  Unlike most in-ear, I can wear comfortably all day if I loosely cradle them on ear.  While outdoors, they allow you to hear the environment, including wind, which is a downside.  Fortunately, they do not generate the cord noise that is such a pet peeve of mine.  Great all around value.  I don't know that the value can be beat for the quality of plugs, and the very well designed case.  Being so cheap, I also don't have to fret too much if the Janitor decides to steal this pair also.<br/><br/>JVC "Flats":<br/>These are on ear headphones, so probably not fair to compare to ear buds.  Still they were part of my purchase, so I am including for contrast.  At only 12 dollars, I was very surprised how crisp and clean these sounded.  They delivered a balanced spectrum, without sacrificing bass as I'd expected.  They do not isolate noise as well as in-ear, but you do get some reduction without having to turn your music WAY up.  For straight music listening or watching a video, I might choose these most of the time at home.  They do not seem to generate cord noise due to movement, but are bulkier than what I want to walk in.  They also fold "flat" making them a nice travel pair for people who don't like in-ear buds.  I keep mine in an inexpensive ipad mini neoprene case, for example.  Would be easy to take on a plane.  I have a big head [really], despite their diminuitive size, they adjusted to fit very comfortably.  I can wear for long sessions, without bother.  Can't go wrong with these.<br/><br/>Skullcandy "Ink'd":<br/>This may not be a fair comparison either.  I think these had the greatest "retail" price when they were new, but I bought them on sale at Ross stores for about 15 dollars.  These are a few years old, so might be an older make than what is available now.  However, I am still surprised by how good these sound to me.  Of all the ear buds in my collection these are probably my favorite for music.  It figures, after buying several, the one I had still sounded best to me.  It has plenty of bass, without sacrificing the overall quality like the iLuvs seem to.  However, it is still one of the loudest of my collection, and is uncomfortable to sleep with on my devices.  My radio is more sensitive and can tune more quietly, but I rarely use that to sleep to.  This set also probably produces the most cord noise of any ear buds meaning they won't walk the beat with me.  It also features metallic red and white buds, white cord, and the companies trade mark as a red skull.  While I think they look "cool" the skull and colors all look a little childish.  They are not as garish as the iLuvs, but they are certainly second in my comparison.  That said, there are more sedate colorings available, however they all have the contrasting skull logo in some fashion or other.  As such these will mostly be used privately.<br/><br/>Sentry Wind-ups:<br/>These were my least favorite.  I was drawn in by the promise of a nifty carry case again.  I might have kept just for that, if they'd have worked.  However, the cord winder was rather difficult to accuate, at least for my biggish hands.  Also my pair of buds may have been defective.  The right bud produced only half the volume of the left.  I took back to Wal-mart asap.  At only 5 dollars, I didn't expect much, but I did expect balance across left and right.  I would presume that was a single item issue, but I did not want to get a second pair to find out.  Sound was more hollow than most I tried, not even measuring up to the 3 dollar JVC's.<br/><br/>There it is.  I hope you've these comments helpful in finding your pair.</span>

<span>Bought these for my 80-something year old Mom. She can hear very clearly through them. With her soft voice, the microphone helps her voice project tremendously so she uses much less effort to speak, yet she is very audible. The clarity is now giving her more encouragement to call her friends because she can now hear them better, they can hear her, and she is not so tired after a conversation. The sound quality is so good that I ordered another pair for me today (to replace the originals that came with my phone).  Good simple purchase. Worth it.</span>

<span>Unfortunately, Apple has redesigned their earbuds so that they are now even smaller than they used to be.  Already, with the old design, they were so small I had to cover each ear bud with a specially made silicone thingie (which are called “Lunies Apple Earpods Covers”), so that they’d stay in my ears.  Now with this new Apple design, the earpieces are so small that they fall out even with the silicone thingie on.  I’m knocking off 2 stars, because now they’re twice as annoying.<br/><br/>As usual, Apple’s packaging is amazing.  This might be a weird thing to notice or care about, but aesthetically it’s a pleasure to see such beautiful design.  If only they would take as much care in the product itself!  To me, the fact that they fall out is really a downer, because I use earbuds not just for phone calls but to listen to music while commuting.  The first day I used them, even with the silicone covers on, they fell out every few minutes.  I actually had to Jerry rig a second pair of silicone covers in order to get the damn buds to stay in.  (I use two covers per bud, now, but have to carefully trim the second cover so that it fits over the first.)  Obviously, it would be more desirable if I didn’t have to use any silicone covers in the first place.  But two?!  Do better, Apple, and I don’t mean by skimping on materials.</span>

<span>I bought these for my son because while he does have the Apple ear buds, he uses them a lot. And the battery life isn’t the greatest. So, while the Apple earbuds charge, he can use these. The only thing is that they don’t have the lightning cable plug, so you do have to buy an adapter for it.<br/><br/>Overall he says they do the job. He can still watch YouTube videos or play video games while using them. Though he said the one thing he doesn’t like is that when he uses them with his oculus the wires do get in the way.<br/><br/>I told him that in reality that’s not the reason why I bought them. And that he shouldn’t complain about that. (First world problems right?)  But he said they work great, sound is good and he doesn’t have to worry about the battery dying ever when using them. So again they do the job. Plus the price is right compared to Apple’s wired earbuds ($19!)<br/><br/>I may get a pair myself because my cat just ruined mine by chewing on the cable of my last set of Apple earbuds!<br/><br/>So I would give these a try since my 10 yr old son likes them.</span>

<span>OK, I'll admit it - I am a Mo-mo.  The phrase Mo-mo was a slang expression my boss used, at the employment agency I worked in many years ago.  I quickly learned that it describes someone who is a real dummy - I once heard Jay Leno use it on the Tonight Show.  So why do I admit to being a Mo-mo (or a Mo, for short)?  For one thing, I have never been able to figure out how to use ear-bud type headsets.  I have always insisted that the ear-buds refused under any circumstances to stay put in my ear.  As a result, I have always depended upon the relative comfort of over-the-head type headphones, no matter how bulky or silly looking.  People would ask me why I wore over-the-head kind, and I would reply that I simply couldn't wear the kind with ear inserts.<br/><br/>Recently, I have been playing my MP3 player a lot more.  I have also taken to listening to music while relaxing before I go to sleep, but I soon found out that the bulky earphones I have insisted on using lo these many years are completely uncomfortable when trying to lie down, let alone fall asleep, so I decided to finally explore some more practical in-ear headphones.  Reading several Amazon reviews, I decided to try the MEEElectronics M6-BK Sport Sound-Isolating In-Ear Headphones, which sounded inexpensive and got fairly good reviews.<br/><br/>Well, they arrived yesterday, and I was blown away.  First of all, my biggest fear about using an in-ear headphone was that they would fall out of my ears, as other ear-bud types had in the past.  I guess I never thought about the fact that I had only tried in-ear headphones that were included with the medium-priced audio products I had owned.  I had never bothered to seek out a headphone designed for people who have trouble keeping them in their ears, as I do.  What a Mo-mo!  Anyway, this set comes with five pair of rubber ear-inserts, in various shapes and sizes, which are easy to exchange and use.  The very first pair of inserts I tried seemed to fit in snugly and securely, but I experimented until I found the most comfortable pair.  The instructions note that it is usual for two different sized inserts to fit comfortably into each ear, and I wound up using two very different inserts, one for each ear, supplying me with the most comfortable fit.<br/><br/>Next was the sound.  I put them into my MP3 player and was pleasantly surprised by the crisp, high treble and firm, solid bass.  The music was clear, with virtually no distortion, and was certainly much better than any over-the-ear headphone I'd tried, and I've been looking for the "right one" for years.  To test it, I listened to several different genres of music - jazz, classical, country, blues, Latin, folk and opera, and the sound for each genre ranged from very good to excellent.<br/><br/>Even better, when this product says "noise cancelling" they mean it.  The outside noise is kept to a minimum; I am able to hear just enough outside sound to not feel completely isolated, which I like.  I also find that I do not need to play music very loud to hear it well.  Thus, I believe I am saving what's left of my hearing along with my sanity.<br/><br/>All in all, these are great headphones for the price and just what this Mo-mo needed.  Very much recommended.</span>

<span>I am a drummer in a rock band and have multiple sets of expensive in ear monitors. I purchased a pair of these to use as “junk earbuds” and was very surprised. I love the over the ear buds as they don’t get pulled out while moving around when I drum or exercise. These do a darn good job of staying put. Also the sound quality was better than expected. My wife can’t tell the difference between these and my expensive sets. In fact she keeps taking mine. I have had to purchase three more sets of these as she keeps stealing mine and losing them. I keep buying these as you can’t get better for the price. I know as I have tried many different brands and models.</span>

<blockquote><em><div class="a-row a-spacing-small review-data"><span class="a-size-base review-text review-text-content" data-hook="review-body">
<span>I am a musician and I also workout at a gym. A bought these after reading several reviews because people said they would actually fit into tiny ears like mine. I've tried a number of in-ear monitors over the years, and none fit into my very small ear canals. The only in-ear monitors I've ever been able to use were custom-fit from Starky. Unfortunately, one of those monitors was broken in an accident, and I don't have another $500 to get custom-fit again. So I bought these.<br/><br/>I'm giving this 4-stars. The only way I'd give it a 5-star is if the sound quality exceeded the cost. These are simple $20 noise-cancelling in-ear monitors. I feel you get a great value for the price.<br/><br/>Ear Size<br/><br/>These monitors are great for tiny ears. One of the fittings works really well for my small ears. In fact, the current fitting I use is so small that with the sweat I work up from shows or the gym, occasionally the monitors slip out of my ear canal a tiny bit and I have to continuously push them back in. I'm going to try one of the other fittings to see if I can't get a slightly more snug fit. Considering I've never been able to buy cheap in-ear monitors and have them fit, I was really pleased with the fit size.<br/><br/>Noise-Cancelling<br/><br/>I use these primarily for shows. I am a guitar player, I play in a rock cover band, and I use these with my Shure PSM600. Bands are loud, and I need the earbuds to cancel the external noise. These do the trick. They're not as good as custom-fit in the noise cancelling department, but nothing is. However, they are very effective at cancelling and I need that. When I put these on and our band starts playing, I'd guess that 80% or more of what I am hearing is what is coming through the in-ear monitors, and the rest is pretty easy to ignore.<br/><br/>Sound Quality<br/><br/>They're $20 in-ear monitors. I don't know what people expect with these when I read some of the overly critical reviews. For $20 you get noise-cancelling in-ear monitors. Yes, they don't sound like earbuds that are $100 or more. They're $20. I found the sound adequate for what I use them for: gigs and the gym.<br/><br/>Cord Length<br/><br/>Some reviews here whine about the cord being too long. If you use these for music, as an in-ear monitor, like I do, you will love the cord length. It's not too long - it's just right. I also find the cord to be just the right length for gym use. I plug my in-ear monitors into my phone or iPod, and then put the iPod in the pocket in my shorts. I have tried using arm-bands and such, but the arm bands always slip down and I spend half my time dealing with that. So I prefer to just put my music device in my pocket. The cord is long enough to accomplish this. Honestly, I don't know why people whine about the cord length. Anything shorter would be useless.<br/><br/>Drawbacks<br/><br/>I do notice, from time to time, some sound quality issues that I believe are related to the quality of the cable that is used. At times, I have noticed sound cutting-in and cutting-out very quickly when the cord is in movement. This happens in all scenarios - not just with the PSM600 (most of my cut-in/cut-out from the PSM600 is due to radio transmission of the signal; this is not what I am referring to in this review). At the gym, for instance, if the cord twists a certain way, for a split second I'll lose the signal and then it comes back. If you're just walking down the street then it's fine, but if you're exerting yourself at the gym or a show, moving around a lot, the cord does seem to affect sound quality a bit. However, I look at the price point - $20 - and still think these are a bargain for what you get.<br/><br/>Conclusion<br/><br/>If you don't have the money for great noise-cancelling in-ear monitors, these do the trick. And if you have tiny ears, these are great (since so few in-ear monitors can handle tiny ears). If I had more money I'd probably look for a higher-quality monitor that hopefully used a more stable cable. But honestly, considering how much work I have put these through this past summer, I feel like I have definitely got my money's worth out of them. They're still in good shape and continue to function well.</span>

<span>I have the over-ear Sony Bluetooth headphones but it was getting a little clunky so I bought these in-ear buds as well. Have only used for a day and the sound quality is great for music and for calls. The persons across the phone line also think so too! Only thing I’d suggest is the little multi-purpose button. Not sure what it’s suppose to do. I press on it and nothing comes on. Could be because it’s attached to my laptop and not my phone.

<span>Given their size and price I wasn't expecting much but these other then wishing they had a longer cord are great. (why I took a star for sports headphones the cord isn't long enough to comfortably use it with a phone unless it's mounted near the shoulder otherwise i snags on the arm and isn't long enough to drape without snagging for a phone in jacket pocket or on a waist type clip ) I was impressed by how loud they got when I cranked my phone volume up all the way which is just enough to hear over traffic when walking in town with most headphones I had to turn these down a couple of notches so I didn't blow my ear drums out. The earbud is small enough to fit into my ear comfortably and the over the ear pieces hold it in place. These are the only ones I could find that still have that feature. Since I'm small most earbuds don't fit well and fall out. With the ear piece these stay put. I'll definitely take these hiking with me. I'll just have to figure out where to put it high enough the short cord won't be a problem</span>
