Upgrade your sound and style with Samsung Galaxy Buds Live. Designed with a larger Galaxy Buds speaker, improved bass, and an open fit, playlists sound more like live music than ever before. An open design creates a live listening environment, suiting those who prefer a natural, spacious sound. When you need to block out background noise for a phone call or important tasks, initiate Active Noise Cancellation with a touch. Tap earbuds again to let in surrounding live sounds — colleagues’ voices, flight announcements, street traffic—while still enjoying your favorite playlist or podcast. Samsung Galaxy Buds Live are easy on the eyes, light on the ears, and have long-lasting battery life. Features including Active Noise Cancellation is enabled via a Bluetooth connection, the Galaxy Wearable app on Android, which you can download from Google Play, and the Galaxy Buds app on iOS devices, available through the App Store. Actual battery life may vary and depend on usage conditions such as function settings, playback file type, and Bluetooth signal strength. Connectivity: Bluetooth® Version, Bluetooth v5.0 Bluetooth Profiles :A2DP, AVRCP, HFP.

<div class="slideshow-container">
<blockquote><em><div class="a-row a-spacing-small review-data"><span class="a-size-base review-text review-text-content" data-hook="review-body">
<span>I purchased these after trying a different pair of air-pod looking buds (cheaper ones) that just weren't comfortable and stuck down below the ear. These fit nicely so they don't come flying out if I have to take off a mask, helmet, etc. The sound quality seems good, although I'm not sure they're the best on offer at this price point. The comfort is pretty good after an initial adjustment period. I generally prefer in-ear types, to be fair.<br/><br/>The noise cancellation is minimal.<br/><br/>I like the no-button touch control but samsung has elected to tie a lot of functionality to their app which, predictably, requires all sorts of permissions to work. One additional issue I have with these is that you cannot seem turn them off via touch. You have to put them in the charging case, use the app (maybe?), or disconnect bt via your phone. I'd much prefer if there were a way to turn them off by simply holding them for a few seconds like most button-based devices.</span>

<span> After hearing the buzz and seeing the leaks on these over the last few months, I was anxiously awaiting their release.<br/><br/>Now, with them in hand (or ears, rather), I have some serious concerns.<br/><br/>I wanted these for the use of listening to music and equally, if not more importantly,  for hands free phone calls.<br/><br/>For the record: I have paired these with my Samsung S8 phones. I have alternated between two S8's and have found identical results<br/><br/>Being a 100% Android and anti-Apple consumer, I can honestly say that Apple got it right with the AirPods.  Not only for sound but for call transmitting and receiving audio quality.  The Galaxy Buds Live may not be up to the same level in the call quality department.<br/><br/>Call Quality:  From my first call, the audio I heard from the caller sounded quite good. Then the audio I was hearing began to sound a bit distorted and I kept experiencing a lot of digital noise. What I found is, if I put my phone in my pocket, or I'm holding my phone and I put my hand down by my side, it almost seems like I lose connection or there is interference. As if the signal is poor. But, if I'm holding the phone upright, or almost right near my face, the sound seems fine. Shouldn't be like this.  On the plus side, in comparison with my Bose headphones, multiple callers said these sounded equally as good on their end.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, I have to rate the call quality as Very Bad at this point. After being sent a second pair, same exact issue.<br/>I am curious if this is some form of a software incompatibility issue with the Samsung Galaxy S8.  Because the call quality is so poor, and I intended on using these heavily for calls, these are now likely to be returned.<br/><br/>The Fit:  Very interesting but nice. They're light, comfortable and once you trust that they won't fall out, you really feel like they're not even there.<br/><br/>Music/Audio:  Sounds great. I'm not a $1000 headphone audiophile.  It needs to sound clear with your highs and mids defined and just good in general. Sound quality is very good. Here's the catch was that though. I started noticing the same signal issue that I was noticing with the call quality. While I was watching/listening to a YouTube video and I put the phone in my pocket or I walked away from the phone, mind you only a couple feet away, it seems like there's interference or the reception is bad. It cuts out constantly. Again, this shouldn't be happening.<br/><br/>Active Noise Canceling:  I'd have to say that my Bose QC35ii's are my benchmark for ANC. That bar is pretty high.  The Galaxy Buds Live disappointingly offer little in terms of ANC technology.  If you're looking for the same level if ANC that you get from a good pair of over the ear or in ear silicone tip ear buds, this will not measure up.<br/><br/>I experimented with this.  While sitting indoors, in a relatively quiet setting, you almost feel like you notice the ANC effectiveness.  Walking down the street with moderate car/traffic noise, I noticed absolutely no ANC effect. Merely an automatic battery drain at best.<br/><br/>Wearable App:  Good.  It would be nice to have a more dynamic equalizer option rather than the "canned" sound profiles.<br/><br/>Overheating:  I've yet to actually find information on this in the manual, but I believe that they have an overheating prevention feature where the individual earbud will begin beeping continuously in your ear. The audio playing, in my case a podcast, doesn't stop but a continuous beep begins. Not being able to figure out why, my best guess is that this is an overheating warning. I had been sitting outside and my left side was facing the sun. It was not excessively hot out and the actual left earbud did not feel warm or get warm in my ear. However, it repeatedly kept beeping.<br/><br/>General Performance:<br/>- In the home office and around the house: Not bad. I enjoy the lightweight design. As long as my phone is in front of me and not in a pocket, audio and call reception and quality are good.<br/>- On the elliptical: Nice. Comfortable and stay in place. Slight movement as you build a bit of a sweat.<br/>- Outside for a walk: ANC is non-existent. I also notice wind noise if it's a little breezy. By breezy, I mean a very light and intermittent wind. Not a hurricane.<br/>- On a bicycle ride: Crazy wind noise. Very off-putting, unfortunately.<br/>- Online Microsoft Teams Meeting (Android App on S8): I was told that I sounded distant and the audio was thin. As soon as I disconnected and called the person directly, they said I sounded great.<br/><br/>Summary: Very disappointed at this point. This is primarily due to the reception issues.  The price point is great for what I had expected. However, for what they are, I'd just as soon spend much, much less for a set of wireless headphones since making calls with these simply doesn't seem to be a good feature, out of the gate.<br/><br/>After running through all of the same with two separate sets of GBL's, using two different S8's, I've gotten identical results. I'm hoping that perhaps this may just be an S8 compatibility issue, as indicated earlier. I would enjoy editing this review to be nothing short of incredible, in the future.<br/><br/>Because they are so new, Samsung telephone support couldn't be all that helpful. With these being, literally, on the market for only a couple of days, there wasn't a whole lot of trouble shooting assistance available.<br/><br/>At this point, I've gone through two sets of these and have not seen a difference between the two. I'm torn whether or not I should return them. I so badly want them to work out. But, I'm finding that they're just not measuring up.</span>

<span>I don't usually write review on amazon,<br/>but I was just really not happy with what samsung is doing here.<br/><br/>First of all, let me introduce myself, I am a audiophile that has experienced and owned quite a lot audio equipment from extreme high end ones (the $50,000 hifiman Shangri la system), to flagship overear/in ear (beyerdynamic T1, xelento) that cost around  $800 today, to extreme cheap ones like the under $10 ve monk.<br/><br/>But I am NOT the type of audiophile that only nitpicking sound quality in his/her subjective way and care nothing about comfort, longevity, good features etc.<br/><br/>Far from that, I value a good fit and comfort over many other qualities. and for certain type of headphones, I value  features like convenience, noise cancelling over sound quality.<br/><br/>But I have a MINIMUM BAR of sound quality of course.<br/><br/>HERE COMES THE REVIEW of the galaxy buds live:<br/>OVERALL:  2/5<br/>I give it overall 2 out of 5 because there are products (namely galaxy buds+) that's better then this in nearly every way and has lower price. And buds live has its own issues.<br/><br/>COMFORT and FIT:  3/5<br/>IN SHORT, need some work to adjust the fit, some parts irritates skin after long wearing.<br/><br/>If you absolutely can not wear in-ear earphones, then this is not bad and this is pretty much your only choice for  true wireless headphones along side the original air-pods.<br/>But the issue is, everywhere this little thing touches your ear is hard plastic except for the tinny little rubber tip that sits in the upper part of your outer ear. And that rubber part has a pretty small contact area, your ear will be irritated for usage over 30 min or so.<br/>And it's not the easiest earphones to adjust its position correctly and securely, you'll find yourself adjust it quite a lot before you can finally enjoy your music. And the fit affects the sound quality a lot, by a lot I mean if you don't push down the lower part to ensure the speaker is as close to your ear canal as possible, this thing would sound bass light, and if you push it down all the all, it's absolutely bass heavy. I can imagine different people hearing quite different sound from it because of there ear shape. There's a reason for high-end ear-buds all using in-ear design.<br/>ADD: the case is among the smallest, which is a plus. but it's not a standout quality in 2020<br/><br/>FEATURES: 1/5<br/>IN SHORT: noise isolation is worse then regular in-ear headphones without active noise cancelling feature. and touch controls are usable but nothing special.<br/><br/>The buds live should NOT be advertised as a noise cancelling headphones, this is one of the two reason I'm writing this review. In fact, the noise cancelling level is substantially worse then the galaxy ear buds+ which has no noise cancelling feature.  pretty much ANY in-ear headphones will isolate better then buds live.<br/>The touch control and all other small feature set are nothing special, usable and usual is the word I would give.<br/><br/>THE ESSENTIALS for true wireless headphones 3/5<br/>IN SHORT: good battery life, unstable connection, short connection range.<br/><br/>the good thing is the battery life is good, not the best, but good for most. around 6 - 8 hours without noise cancelling on.<br/>The connection however, is not good. a lot of the time it has syncing issues when connected to my windows computer, usually put them back in case would solve the problem, this problem is quite frequent that it would annoy you quite a bit. And non of my other true wireless headphones have this issue, at least not to the extent that it annoys me. Connect to my galaxy s10 have much less issue though, only have sync issue when switching from device to device occasionally. The connection range is not good too, the signal cuts off completely when I walk from my desk to the bathroom, and for the reference, at the same spot at my bathroom, my airpods pro works normally without any signal loss, my galaxy buds+ would buzz in and out a bit.<br/><br/>THE SOUND:<br/>IN SHORT: acceptable,  3/5<br/>The sound I would describe as V shaped, somewhat muddy in low to mid frequency. average resolution, a better then average sound stage and imaging. I feel the driver in this has potential, but it's restricted by the ear bud design choice, since this thing has no seal, they have to adding quite a lot of bass by eq/dsp to compensate for it. And I think they overdone it, and ironically, the bass is certainly plenty in terms of quantity, but it doesn't have the smooth, fast and deep extension quality that comes out of galaxy buds+ from samsung themself.<br/>The mids are overshadowed by the lows. simple as that.<br/>The highs are average, nothing exciting about it.<br/>The sound stage are good for in-ear, imaging are above average too, but the lack of detail (which is understandable for a bluetooth heaphone without aptX or LDAC support) means you can't really pinpoint, and the muddy bass is not helping.<br/><br/>Conclusion:<br/><br/>this is a complete downgrade from the galaxy buds+ I have. It's harder to wear, less comfortable except for people who cannot withstand in-ear design. It has shorter battery per charge, from around 12 hours from buds+ to around 7 hours from buds live. It has worse noise isolation, which is unacceptable since it's in the advertise. The sound quality is average, not nearly as good as galaxy buds+ in terms of bass and mids, somewhat at the same level in highs and soundstage. And buds live has a higher price tag. And these two product come from the same company, which annoys me quite a bit. What's the thinking behind it, samsung and your AKG department? advertising? something new? "the new open ear noise cancelling?" it's just wrong in my opinion.<br/><br/>My recommendation for true wireless headphones as in time of writing this review:<br/><br/>The utility beast:  airpods pro<br/><br/>Pros:<br/>1. Probably the most stable and furthest connection from named brand, for ios, or for android and windows.<br/>Very good audio/video latency, which makes it very usable for mobile/casual gaming, or even just watching video.<br/>2. A solid noise cancelling and transparent, natural sounding is the word I would call the feeling of both noise cancelling and transparent mode. The mic quality is also among the best if not the best in true wireless.<br/>3. A comfortable fit. less pressurized feeling then most in-ear headphones. a bit chunky, so not the most comfortable for your long session listening, but if you don't jam it too hard into your ear, you can listen to airpods pro for quite a long time, over 2 hours I would say.<br/>4. A relaxing and enjoyable sound. it's doesn't have much detail/resolution, lack some high notes in particular, average sound-stage, not very pin-point in imaging, too. But I gotta say, it sounds good enough, even for audiophile like me. Part of the reason is the noise cancelling helps to make sure you can hear as much performance as it can offer. The other part is that the tuning is just easy to listen to, a good bass extension without too much mid-bass, a bit mid-forward makes the vocal stand out, which is good for a lot of the mainstream pop music, a reduced high makes it easy to enjoy your music for a long period of time during travel. And the sound is also very consistent,  a deeper or shallower insertion doesn't affect it much.<br/><br/>Cons:<br/>less then 5 hour of usage per charge might not enough for some.<br/>and really, besides not "great" sounding for those who can not withstand anything less then true audiophile quality, that's the only shortcoming I can think of.<br/><br/>A taste into audiophile world: galaxy buds / buds+<br/>Yes I have own both buds/buds+<br/>Pro:<br/>1. good fit and comfort, low-profile looking. You may feel a little pressure when you first put them like most in-ears. But they are by far the most comfortable true wireless earphones for long listening sessions.<br/><br/>2. Great sounding. I challenge you to find in-ear headphones that sounds significantly better then these, wired or wireless. Especially for the original galaxy buds, As they are under $100 today and honestly, besides bass not as deep as buds+, I prefer the sound of the original galaxy buds since the mids are not as recessed and highs are more smooth comparing to buds+. sound stage and imaging are both very good in buds/buds+;<br/><br/>3. Great battery life per charge and good mic quality. over 12 hours of battery life per charge and a good enough mic quality is the reason you buy buds+ over buds<br/><br/>Cons:<br/>connection and range are not the best (but totally usable).<br/>battery in case only provides one more charge for both buds/buds+. so if you forget to put your buds/buds+ in the case once over night, you might lose half of your total battery life.<br/>For people need active noise-cancelling for travel, these don't offer the feature, (but it still block quite some noise for everyday use).<br/><br/>For those considering sony and sennheisers's true wirelless, Consider the large size of them, they might not fit you, and the cases are quite large too. So I just don't bother trying them.</span>

<span>I'll start off by saying I'm a huge fan of Samsung products. I've been using their Galaxy phones since the S5, we have their fridge, and now this ear bud. But I gotta say, Samsung should stick with their phones and other products because these earbuds doesn't really stand up against other name brands and some of the even knock-off, low-budget earbuds. I can say a lot more bad than good stuff about them so I'll try to break it down.<br/><br/>Packaging:<br/>Right away the minimalism in the packaging is really nice. You get everything in a tiny box. The case for the ear buds has a really sleek, smooth polish to it. The earbuds also have a neat magnetic clip when putting it back in the case so that's a cool plus from me.<br/><br/>Sound:<br/>Now going to the real reason why you would purchase these earbuds. The sound off the bat is a little meh. It's good, but it doesn't have that extra boom compared to most earbuds, but I think that's because this doesn't have the little suction earbud caps to get that tight fit into your ears. Instead, it has what they call "wing tips" in only two sizes, S and L, and while they are supposed to have a better fit for your ears to get better sound quality, either sizes didn't do justice. Wearing these is like having a tiny speaker in your ear but if the speaker was a little far from you with not enough bass unless you put your volume on at 100% but you don't want to kill your eardrums with that all the time. The treble is really good on these though.<br/><br/>ANC:<br/>One main reason I wanted to get these was the active noise-cancelling. Most earbuds in this price range don't have ANC, let alone passive ANC. The ANC does its job but at first it was a little hard figuring out if it was on or not based from the jingle it gives. There's a [happy] jingle, but that makes the treble lower and a [sad] jingle that makes the treble higher, but shouldn't that mean ANC is on? Off? I don't know, the jingles don't make sense so don't pay much attention to it. You'll know when ANC is on or not.<br/><br/>Controls:<br/>The touch on these earbuds is VERY sensitive. Even on my first hour of using them, the earbuds thought I was trying to skip (double tap), when I only tapped once (pause). It can also become a hassle when you're trying to take them off/put them back on because you'll definitely find yourself tapping the earbuds so when you're putting them on or off you'll most likely pause or play your music by accident leaving you an extra step to resume whatever is you were doing.<br/><br/>After using them for less than 30 minutes, the insides of my ears started to hurt--not because I had the volume on at 100%, but my ear was physically hurting because these earbuds aren't that comfortable and yes, I had them on as shown in the instructions booklet, moved them around, tried both sizes of the wing tips, it just still hurt after prolonged use. However, these made for decent running earbuds. They didn't get close to falling off my ear compared to other earbuds despite not having the suction caps. The quick connect function is also really nice when using my Samsung phone, not sure how it'd be with other phones, but it paired straight and quick out of the box to both my phone and my laptop.<br/><br/>Would I recommend these earbuds to others? If ANC is really something you're going for in earbuds, sure.  But there are better over-the-ear headphones you can get around this price range with better sound quality and ANC you can go for. If you don't care about ANC, there's definitely better options out there.</span>

<span>There is a TLDR at the end for those of you that got scared clicking read more and see a wall of text appear on your screen. Since there's a lot I have to say about these headphones, grab some popcorn, a soda, and strap in.<br/>As a forward, I have only tried these for a few hours, so I will update this post if my opinions change at all.<br/>Some initial things to get out of the way, I am by no means an experienced audiophile. I do enjoy the many different aspects of audio though. I love the character of vinyl and have tried many different headphones over the years. By many, I mean dozens, as I have a very weirdly shaped ear canal that has trouble getting in-ear headphones to fit correctly. My main daily pair of headphones is the second-gen Airpods since they are the only thing that fit my ear well. I also have a pair of Skullcandy Crushers for when I want a pair of car subs attached to my ears and Jaybird X3's with Comply tips for skating and exercising. My testing device is a Note 20 Ultra, using Spotify set to the extreme quality setting (320kbps to my knowledge).<br/><br/>FIT AND COMFORT<br/>This category is incredibly subjective, as everyone's ears are different. I will say, however, that this is the first pair of in-ear headphones that fit my incredibly weird ears out of the box!!! I've done the shake test and they stay pretty well in there. Comfort is a 5/5<br/><br/>DESIGN AND BUILD QUALITY<br/>The design and build are top-notch on these buds. The case feels incredibly solid and is about the same size as the case on my Airpods (the buds case is slightly thicker). The buds themselves look great and the mirror finish is nice to look at. Overall, very well designed and built and thusly, gets a 5/5.<br/><br/>SOUND QUALITY<br/>Another bit of forwarding before I jump in, this is another subjective category. I am sensitive to "bright" headphones (where the highs or treble are too high and sound painful to my ear) and steer away from them as soon as I notice them. I am only going to be commenting on certain tracks and genres that I enjoy and actively listen to.<br/>I am blown away from the raw quality of the sound coming out of these! I had the Airpods Pro for a bit, and these sound similar but tuned for a tad more bass. This is exactly what I was looking for. You also have a couple of preset EQ options to tune it more to your liking or listening habits for the day. I'm hoping adjustable EQ support comes in the future to help dial in the sound signature to your liking. I'll break down each track and categorize it by genre.<br/><br/>-ELECTRONIC/HOUSE/OTHER SUB-GENRES<br/>Transformer by Moog: I chose this track to see if the backing cymbal can be heard amidst the rest of the song. It's very clear, along with the rest of the track. Bass also sounds very nice, not overdone, and very tight and punchy. Clarity and great bass quality will be a reoccurring character in this segment.<br/><br/>-ROCK/METAL<br/>I Love You to Death by Family Force 5: (This is the song I used for the shake test.) This is a track that I like to crank and test the audio quality at high volume. I can confirm that these buds sound just as good at high volumes. The cymbals don't destroy my ears, the guitars are very clear, and SGA's screams are great.<br/><br/>Suck My Kiss by Red Hot Chili Peppers: This is another track that regularly gets cranked. Flea's bass sounds perfect and once again, clear as day. The drums also sound killer.<br/><br/>-RAP<br/>Jump by Mac Miller: I chose this track to hear how clear and tight the bass was. The bassline on this one can sound very different depending on what headphones you use. It's tight and punchy with these. Clarity was also strong on this one.<br/><br/>Bless Yo Trap by Smokepurpp: This song is perfect for its incredibly heavy (but well-produced) bass. This track through the Crushers will literally shake my head, it's great. These buds handle the drum machine (cymbal perhaps?) in the background very, very well. Most headphones will usually force me to limit the volume because it sounds so shrill. Not on these. I can crank them up and not worry about it. The bass left a bit to be desired... Until I used the bass booster EQ, which as you can probably guess, upped the bass and still sounded punchy and tight. Well done.<br/><br/>Big Fish by Vince Staples: I also tested the bass booster EQ on this one. I noticed when it was enabled, it started to eat into the clarity of the mids a bit. Without the EQ it sounds crystal clear.<br/><br/>Where I'm From by Digable Planets: This song's nice short bassline can sound different depending on your headphones. Very accurate and well-controlled bass on this one.<br/><br/>-CLASSICS<br/>Rocket 69 by Todd Rhodes: This is the "make it or break it" moment for figuring out if headphones are too "bright" for me. Todd's vocals, along with the amazing sax solo can destroy my ears on some headphones. These handle this track PERFECTLY. Everything seems very well controlled and balanced. These buds produce a fantastic sound, without over-emphasizing any one aspect of the sound profile. Bass is nice and subdued (you could be surprised with what the Crushers do to this track) and the highs are not shrill or painful to my ears. The mids sound crisp and clear.<br/><br/>-POP/NOT SURE THE GENRE<br/>Sit Next to Me by Foster the People: I was surprised by this track. I never noticed the bass guitar before. This is when I realized how much I was missing using the Airpods. Everything is so well defined and the stereo separation is perfect. Not much else to say about this one, as everything about it sounds great.<br/><br/>-COUNTRY<br/>What Was I Thinkin' by Dierks Bentley: This track was another case of pure clarity. I could easily hear and discern every instrument and they were separated perfectly. A joy to listen to on these. Nothing was overblown on this one either, the bass might be a bit too high, but it's so tight that it adds to the sound in my opinion.<br/><br/>All of these tracks sound great to my ear and easily get a 5/5<br/><br/>MEDIA CONTROLS<br/>Finally, something I dislike about these headphones. The single tap to pause/play a track works just fine. If you try to double-tap to skip/replay it is incredibly hit or miss. I'm not sure if this can be solved through software, or if my finger just doesn't hit the touch surface as well as it would like. Usually what ends up happening is, I double-tap to skip a track and it registers it as one tap, thus pausing my music. I then double-tap again to try to get it to skip and it just starts playing where it left off. Finally, on the third time, it will skip the track. Adjusting the buds usually ends up registering as a tap and will also usually pause your music, just trying to get it pressed in your ear better. It also does this sometimes when you initially take out the buds from the case and put it in your ear. It's a big pain in the butt right now and gets a 2/5<br/><br/>NOISE CANCELING<br/>Don't buy these for some Bose or Airpod Pro level ANC. They're good at sound isolation when you're playing something, but pausing a track won't leave you saying "wow" like with the Airpod Pros. The only testing I've done so far with the noise canceling is cleaning around the house and listening to them while typing up this review. When a track is playing I can't hear my keyboard, but paused they're just about as clear as having the ambient sound mode on. I'll conduct further testing on these and report back with my findings. For now, it gets a 1/5.<br/>(UPDATE: I've done some testing outside with them now and they are pretty good at blocking the lower frequencies. It takes a little bit for the noise canceling algorithm to catch up with the noise around you, but I would say it blocks out somewhere in the neighborhood of 50-60% of the noise around you. It also is great at removing wind noise at moderate speeds. Based on these new findings, it gets a 3/5. Not great, but not terrible or useless either.)<br/><br/>AMBIENT MODE<br/>I'm happy to see that someone has finally implemented a function that allows the ambient mode to auto switch to on when you're speaking to someone. It's worked perfectly from the testing I've done so far. The ambient mode also sounds almost as good as the Airpod Pros' function. It works well, thus netting a 5/5<br/><br/>CONCLUSION<br/>I am simply blown away by these headphones. So much so, that I spent nearly 2 hours writing this review. They do almost everything they set out to do exceedingly well. I am hoping that future software updates will fix the issues that I currently have with them. I will be replacing my Airpods with these and will be recommending them to my friends. Well done Samsung, you have a real winner on your hands.<br/><br/>Well, that wraps it up. For the TLDR readers out there: they sound amazing, ANC and touch controls suck majorly right now, the build and comfort are perfect, and I would easily recommend them.</span>

<span>I had the Galaxy Buds Plus (Red) and I bought them in 2020. I was really happy with the overall use, function and feel of the Bud Plus. I ended up (by accident) washing and drying them in the laundry. After that I lost some of the functions of the earbuds. Not an issue with the replacement program that I also purchased with the buds here on Amazon through Asurion protection plan. I was able to replace the defective buds with new ones with absolutely no hassle. I ended up spending an extra $22.00 in the replacement because I re-added the protection plan which why not at this point, i'm a firm believer in service/replacement plans.<br/><br/>When I ordered these Buds Pro's, I had read about all the current and new earbuds on the market and as I was doing my research, comparing new with the old and feature for feature, my first notice was the battery life is less than the old Bud Plus's. Significantly less out the box but for me that was not an issue to sway me away from the new Bud's Pro. None the less I started looking at other companies and saw reviews about them (other brands) that told me not to really mess with them. Not even worth calling out other brand names as I think that is a personal preference. I have been privy to Samsung brand for years, owning all the Note phones, except the one that blew up (Current Note 20 Ultra owner) and the former Bud Plus.<br/><br/>When I finally made the decision to go with these Bud Pro's (Black) saw that I could (for no extra cost) get them same day delivered. That was a plus, not that I really needed them same day but thanks for the availability Amazon!! They were late with the delivery but only because we were having a snow storm this day so the 22 minutes later was nothing to trip about. I was just happy that they were safe in traveling and the product arrived undamaged.<br/><br/>Out the box &amp; Pairing:<br/>The buds needed to be charged before they could be used, the case had like 30% battery and the buds were at a low 1%. As soon as I opened the case for the buds, my phone alerted me that they were being paired with my phone so I really didn't even need to "Setup" the buds to my phone but only erase the old profile of the Red Buds. They needed to be at at least 15% for my Note 20 Plus to do the update through the Wear app and the total update time was only a few good minutes. Overall I think the first charge only took about an hour and they were ready to go.<br/><br/>Note of discovery - The Case DOES NOT charge with the Galaxy Watch 4 Classic Magnet Charger as well as the Apple Watch Magnet Charger.<br/><br/>The Case:<br/>The case is smaller than the old Bud Plus's which is no big deal. Off top when opening the case I notice that the lid is slightly loose and "Jiggles" around (left to right) a small amount at the hinge. Not a huge deal if all the bud cases come like this, just don't be reckless when handling your product. This is something that I noticed but doesn't make me feel like I got a "cheap" product at all.<br/><br/>Fitting and Feel:<br/>Pro's<br/>I placed the buds in my ear for the first time and they stayed in place and felt fine. I believe they come with the medium rubber attachments already on them. They felt fine but not like my old ones felt. I looked at the other sizes that were provided and none of them felt "perfect" to me. I still had the old red ones from my last pair and thought I would give it a try and see if they fit on them and how they felt in my ears. Well lets just say that here is my first point of criticism; The old bud attachments work and feel better than the new ones provided and I am glad that I held onto them. If not then I would have had way more to say about the feel and comfort levels of these new ones.<br/><br/>Con's<br/>- Takes a bit of time to get use to the feel of the new design of these buds and when you pick them up out of the case you feel like you are going to drop them.<br/>- Placement into your ears takes a bit more time than the Buds Plus, you feel as if you are going to drop them when you are setting them in your ears.<br/>- The buttons on these are way more reactive and sensitive so be prepared to accidentally pause your media when you try to adjust your buds (unless you have touch block activated)<br/><br/>Note of discovery - I am going to re-try the provided rubber pieces. I went out to do some snow shoveling and noticed that both the buds seemed to feel loose and I had to adjust them a bunch of times to have them feel like they wouldn't fall out. When I was done with my task and walking back into the garage, one (left bud) actually fell out of my ear. I will try the stock ones again for comfort and proper securement.<br/><br/>Sound and Clarity:<br/>Note - I have my EQ setting on the Dynamic setting<br/>In quite environments - They sound great and have no issues to report with the clarity, volume, bass or overall sound they put out. The new 360 sound feature is something to get use to. It sounds cool and reacts to when you turn your head left or right. Imagine having surround sound speakers jammed into your ears or when if you have that feature (Surround Sound Mode) on a television and you turn it on and everything sounds kinda spread out...That would be the comparison I would use to describe 360 sound mode.<br/><br/>In a loud environment - They handle really well and you can have them maxed out on volume and you are able to hear your media very clear.<br/><br/>Con<br/>- Using the 360 mode with media playing in a loud environment wasn't the best experience for me. With all the movements I was doing it made for me having to "focus" on where the sound was coming from at times and made for more of a distraction. Maybe I will get use to this but I think I will just save that function for quite environment listening.<br/><br/>Calls:<br/>In a quite environment - On the receiving end of a call, totally clear and nothing negative to report. You can hear everything that is on the other end of the call in terms of "background" noise but I would say that its nothing to detour you from having a phone conversation. On the callers end, the caller can hear you crystal clear while you are speaking in a normal talking tone without issue. Today and most days I have my ears covered with a hoodie or skull cap which completely covers the ear buds and that played no part in disturbing the functionality of the Buds Pro 👍🏾 the people will still hear you. Another caller reported that until they were told that I was talking through ear buds they thought that I was on the phones regular receiver so no differentiations between the two.<br/><br/>In a loud environment - You can hear the person on the other end of the phone call just fine over the loud noises that are around you. No worries to not understanding the caller, the buds handle just fine.<br/><br/>Con's<br/>- When you have a lot of loud background noises (a running snowblower that you are operating in this case) the caller can't make out all that you are saying (in a "normal" speaking tone) and was reported "Sounds like you are in a tunnel and much harder to hear you." This is something that was reported to me with the old earbuds as well but only after they went through the laundry. I did a "walk away" test from the loud machine and was about 30' away and the caller was able to hear me again just fine, loud and clear. As soon as I walked back up to the machine the same report of not being able to hear me was given.<br/>- You have to YELL in order for people on the other end of the phone call to hear you. They might not make out what you are trying to say and you will have to repeat yourself.<br/><br/>Media (Music/Pod Cast/Videos):<br/>In a quite environment - Sound is great and very clear. The amount of bass is rich and I feel overall a great balance for what they offer. The overall volume seems a bit lower from the previous Buds Plus but I am going off memory of the old buds compared to the new ones. The amount of volume is good enough that you do not need to have the buds all the way up to enjoy the media you are playing. With both buds in you can have the volume set to half or under and still hear very clearly the media you are playing so say if you are in a grocery store and didn't have the ambient sound on but the volume was low to those settings, you would be able to hear your media and surrounding noises just fine.<br/><br/>In a loud environment - Same as above; They handle very well.<br/><br/>Multiple Device Connection:<br/>I was able to connect of course to my phone as a main device, I was also able to connect to my 2019 Macbook Pro without a problem and the sound quality is just a good as when on the phone device. You can control the playback functions and volume from either the laptop or the earbuds. In the future I will be pairing the Buds Pro with other useable devices (Tablets, IPhone) and whatever you can pair to them to see the overall quality.<br/>I did try to connect them to my VIZIO V-Series - 58" Smart 4K HDR TV and was not successful due to no pairing feature on the TV's end. Also I tried to pair them up with some musical equipment that has Bluetooth capability but was not able to pair them but the equipment saw that they were available. I'm guessing that in the future that feature will be available through Akai Professional.<br/><br/>Con's<br/>When playing media through my phone then switching to my laptop you have to manually switch the device in order to play the other source. In the past, being connected to multiple devices, all you would have to do is stop playing one device and start playing the other for the switch to take place. As of right now you have to stop the device that you are playing, then open the bluetooth feature (on the laptop) double click the Bud's Pro in order for the buds to be able to receive the signal for the other "paired" device. And vice versa to switch back from laptop to phone. When I pair my tablet I will try this again and see if its the required method. And after pairing the Bud Pros with my Note Tablet, I have discovered that the above issue is the same and you have to manually switch between both devices to use.<br/><br/>Talk to text:<br/>In a quite environment - Just fine with my dialect. You can speak normal speed and the buds catch everything you are saying. in the past and even just on the phone, I have found myself having to speak like a feelingless robot to get the words that I am speaking to be heard correctly and written out. As I am writing this, "I am now using the talk to text function through the computer, with [the] earbuds and everything that I am in sane [saying] right now through the earbuds is being [typed] out for me and I will leave all of the imperfections in this sentence. I am speaking at a normal tone and normal speed and I would say with the couple of imperfections and misspellings that are in brackets above this thing picks up and it takes what you're saying eerily [very] accurate.<br/><br/>In a loud environment - I can't report anything on this as I have not been in a loud environment to do any of the talk to text yet.<br/><br/>Con's<br/>- The more I use talk to text through the computer I am seeing that I have to speak a little slower and clearer in order for it to understand what I'm saying.<br/>- This will probably be the same with been on the phone and using the talk to text function as well.<br/><br/>OK so overall I have to say that these are pretty dope pieces of technology and equipment to have. If you are new to the Galaxy family or familiar to Galaxy products you will not be 100% disappointed even though this product and every product has its own flaws. For the price and for what I am trying to do, they are working out just fine and met for a perfect replacement from Galaxy Buds Plus that I had.<br/><br/>I really didn't intend for this to be a super long review so thank you so much for reading all of this. I put in a whole lot of detail and I really wanted to make sure that I hit a lot of the key points that anybody else would be interested in when buying earbuds and what others would possibly be looking for. I am a construction worker and I work in asphalt and do a lot of driving so the reason why I wanted to get these earbuds was because the former that I had, the Galaxy Buds Plus worked really well with the environments that I have been in and will be in in the next few months. These earbuds are a perfect replacement or a perfect addition to any truck driver that is out there in your rig with your windows down or anything like that to be able to listen to a phone and talk on the phone and take calls, listen to some music or media in loud environment and still get the job done. The only reason why I would not give this product five stars is because of the list of "cons" that I wrote above in this review. Otherwise, this would be a five star product. Thank you for your time!</span>

<span>What an amazing set of earbuds, these are definitely an upgrade to the original Galaxy Buds (1st Gen), and those were amazing sounding headphones on their own right too. But these pro versions, wow, they blow those out of the water....<br/><br/>Now at first I wasn't really able to notice the quality of the audio, I felt they were about the same as my original buds, boy was I wrong, not only these provide superior audio quality, these buds can literally pickup sounds that I wasn't able to hear before in my older Galaxy Buds, instruments that I didn't know that were there....a perfect example was Dream Theater - Octavarium....try listening to that song with these buds, the first 3 minutes will leave you in a trans-like state, orchestral basically, the sound is rich and just beautiful....<br/><br/>ANC works pretty well imo, it blocks out sound very effectively and you have the choice of two settings, low or high. I usually keep mine at high sense I work as a crossing guard, and I have to be outside several hours at a time listening to cars roaring past me, ANC takes care of that problem it makes a world of difference, I can barely hear any cars passing by me with ANC activated, all I hear is the music....<br/><br/>As for voice activated, its kind of a hit and miss for me, it activates when it detects or hears your voice and lowers down the volume of your music as well as automatically activating ambient sound so you can hear the other person you are speaking with, what I find odd though is it doesn't seem to activate when that person speaks to you first or asks you a question, literally you have to be the one to speak first in order for it to activate.....it can also be very interruptible at times, don't start singing along with any of your tunes because Voice Activated will kick in. EVERY. TIME. WITHOUT FAIL....if you are going to start a conversation you are still better off just removing your left or your right ear bud just to have a normal conversation with someone and just leave voice detect off....<br/><br/>Ambient sound works very well and you have the choice of 4 settings from low to very high, I would suggest you leave it at high max, trust me you don't need it any higher than that ambient sounds works very well and it will pick up everything around you, if you work at an office ambient sound would be a very important feature for you imo....<br/><br/>Very solid build quality, not too big of a fan of the Matt finish though (can be slippery, take caution), but if you hate fingerprints no worries you wont see any of them on these puppies, for such a small case and well thick enough buds, they are surprisingly heavy, it's understandable though, there is so much tech packed in such a small form factor it's no wonder they are slightly heavy, I think it has to do with the magnets, the magnets on these are a huge step up compared to the past buds, very strong your buds will not fall off the case that easy you have to deliberately shake them VERY HARD in order to send them flying....<br/><br/>As for the buds themselves well, they are pretty comfortable, somewhat, idk maybe I'm just going crazy but these are not exactly perfect fit I feel like the first gen buds had the right fit for me, these overtime start to hurt my ears a little bit, never had this problem with the older buds so idk guess it has to do with my ears, I think I just need bigger rubber tips and the largest ones that it came with are just not large enough to provide a better seal, why can't I use my older tips from my first gen buds? or even other tips that are out there? I just don't understand why Samsung didn't make the tips universal on these buds, these tips have a weird proprietary, idk, is connection the right word? anyways, the tips that it came with are solely and only for these buds so do not lose em, I cant find any replacements for these, eBay has some, but they are those foam ones and I don't like the foam ones...way to pull an Apple Samsung....why on earth was that a good idea? just make them universal so I can easily replace these things whenever I want...anyways moving along (sorry that was just a gripe I had)<br/><br/>Controls seem pretty straight forward, if you are coming from the original buds like me you will become instantly familiar with them....tap once pause, tap twice skip track, tap three times previous track....you get the idea....<br/><br/>(I only had these buds for like two days so sadly I haven't been able to test call quality with these, mainly I have just been using them for music, as intended)<br/><br/>In conclusion, there is alot more to these buds I can go on about but in all honesty this will turn into a very long review so I'm just gonna go straight to the point...ahem....BUY THESE....even if you have to use a credit card just, just buy them they are that good and worth every penny....not even the Air-pods Pro can step up with these buds not to mention 50 dollars cheaper and much more up to date technology that's being offered to you, in other words more bang for your buck, you can't go wrong with these and if you are an audiophile trust me, you will want these.....</span>

<span>This is my first set of wireless earbuds. I like that they pair easily and nicely with any product, but am disappointed that Samsung doesn't provide an app to non-Samsung devices to control the earbuds' functions such as ANC, volume up/down, etc. I have a Samsung device, so I was able to change the settings, and I could always borrow someone's, but that is silly.<br/><br/>I have small ears, and these are quite heavy and large, so they stick out. To get them completely wedged in, I use the largest ear tips. The small and medium fit, but yawning or head-shaking caused them to fall out much faster. All ear tips eventually get too stretched out, so I think I'll have to buy spares. I do not do any more vigorous exercise than meditation and walking with these because of the fit.<br/><br/>The wireless charging and USB-C cable included in the box make these a good buy on sale. If I could find a rubberized slip cover for the buds, I bet they would stay in my ears even better. I like that there are a lot of third party accessories, such as cases with lanyards, that you can buy for the standardized Samsung Buds case specifications, too. It future proofs accessories purchases, which makes for less tech waste.</span>

<span>I love the low profile of these earbuds.  This is the first pair that I feel like I can wear all the time.  I've always had Airpod types where you have different size earpieces so I was looking for those in the box before I realized these slide into the ear as is.  You can just about sleep with these on.  You do have to slip them in just right to get the best sound.  I don't believe the noise cancellation is as good as other earbuds I own, like the Airpod, but being much cheaper, particularly on sale, I don't mind the difference.  The touch control is not quite as quick as others but it seems like something to get used to.  The sound is excellent as well as battery life and hold in the ears.  I have a Samsung Galaxy phone so these connect instantly unlike the issues I was having with the Airpods, not always wanting to instantly connect.  For a sub $100 earbud (on sale) these are a great choice.</span>

<span>I have never been a fan of the whole rubber grip ear buds that have to go into your ear. I was after something that would work to rest on the outside of your ear yet provide great quality. Air pods were the ideal ones I had thought but after having gotten these I am very happy to have had these instead. I haven’t had any worries about these falling out of my ears and they still provide me a cool look and great sound quality! I like to dance around a lot and I wear these faithfully every day at work for hours on need and these let me through my day (with relatively one charge / rest period between an 8 shift). I think they’re well worth the money thus far and I would honestly recommend them to my friends and family to get if they don’t like the typical earbud in the ear style</span>

<span>They feel great and sound great. Very comfortable. I was replacing Jabra elite 75t and these are much better. Noise cancellation is meh (Jabra was much better at this), but that is not important to me. I've seen some people saying there are no instructions and no replacement buds. They are in there, just almost hidden. Instructions are in the top of the lid in a black sleeve(you really don't need them, have your Bluetooth on and simply open your case and your phone will ask if you want to connect almost instantly. Then after that use the Galaxy Wearable app, it shows and tells you everything (taps for pause, etc.) You should already have it if you have a Samsung phone.) Buds are in a small paper like wrap wrapped in the chord. They are super light and I can barely feel them in my ears (I have pretty small ears). If fit and sound are important to you, get them, it's very worth it. If noise cancellation is really what you are after I would say look into other buds.</span>

<span>The Samsung Galaxy buds 2 pro are a great wireless headphone set for galaxy phone users. I tested everything except mic quality and phone calls. I found that the comfort for these is there they are slightly smaller than the buds pro. In terms of noise cancelation they are great I wasn't able to hear the fan that was blowing next to me. then I turned it of and could hear some fan noise then switched to ambient sound and could really hear the fan so that sums noise cancelation it works well. In terms of sound quality it can be a mixed bag depending on how new a video is for example I watched a dido live concert performance and it felt like I was there at the concert her voice came thru clearly. I tried some news videos and it didn't sound as wide like the video seemed normal to average sound not like top tier stuff like you could get if you tried wired headsets or headphones. Movies sound great on these watched one scene in the hobbit smaugs voice came across well through the buds. One thing I will say is voices come in real clear on these so these will be great for those movies or music you listen to. I tested asmr videos they work great for that. Overall I'd give them an 8.5 out of 10 I think these are great so far its just a mixed bag when it comes to what content you listen to or watch some stuff sounds phenomenal and other stuff sounds average. I recommend playing with equalizer settings I preferred dynamic.</span>

<span>I really don't have anything negative to say about these. They work really well and the noise cancellation is great. The touch controls can be a little sensitive at times and if they don't sit well in your ears, they can easily be disconnected or calls ended if you try to adjust them. The only other thing is the battery life. If all you do is listen to music or audiobooks, you should be able to get a full eight hours or so out of them. Taking calls and watching videos seems to drastically reduce the life, but they quickly recharge in the case. The case does hold a charge for a long time and can recharge the buds 3 or 4 times itself before need to be charged.</span>

Despues de ver demasiados modelos de audifonos puedo decir que estos son los mejores calidad precio. La verdad la cancelacion de ruido no es mucha pero creeme que te va a islar un poco de los demas. Escuche que los audifonos con el tiempo se les caian de als aorejas a las personas, bueno eso se debe a que nuestro cuerpo suerta una grasa y mas en nuestras orejas que hace que los audifonos despues de unos dias de uso se resbalen. Bien la solucion a eso es limpiar con cuidado los audifonos o acon alcohol o otro liquido que no sea agua.

<span>So I bought a used one and not going to lie it's really good. It was in great conditions. It even brought diffrent ear sizes to pop in and out. The battery life is amazing I don't always use them only when I have to do a phone call and I can't hold my phone or I don't want others to listen to my media and when I'm watching a amovie on my phone and TV. It has so far connected with everything that is Bluetooth. And if you have the latest Samsung phone like mine is a Samsung note s 20 then you can charge the case with the back of your phone which is amazing. I can go a whole 3 days without having to charge the case. I definitely suggest buying used one.

<span>I bought these to replace a pair of the original Samsung earbuds that I accidentally left behind on an international flight recently. Firstly, I was smart enough this time to NOT buy black (was constantly misplacing the previous set - dropped one on the floor once and it took 20 minutes to find it with 2 of us looking for it on dark blue carpet.  I got these in green and I like the color.  Case is white, so that too is nice.<br/><br/>The noise canceling is a nice added feature.  I turned it on and could no longer hear my dogs toe nails as he trip trapped around on my hardwood floors.  I wrinkled some paper and couldn't hear it.  I was listening to music at a low volume (not completely off).  Definitely a nice improvement.<br/><br/>They seem to fit my ears about as well as the originals, so that's great.  I historically would get some ear fatigue with the prior set after about 2 hours of use, so I expect similar with these. My ears are VERY sensitive to fatigue - e.g. I have special pillows I use at night to avoid pain, and before trying Samsung, other brands couldn't stay in my ears for more than 45 mins without hurting.  Barely long enough for a good gym workout.<br/><br/>My ONLY complaint (so far) is that they are slick and shiny, so yes they are easier to drop (already done it once).  Thankfully though, they are much easier to find when I do drop them.  I do miss the texture on my old Samsung buds, but I'm hopeful I get used to these.</span>

<span>I've been using an older set of Bose Headsets since sometime around 2014. It's the model that doesn't cover the ear, but it was always great a canceling noise, and the sound quality while watching movies on my tablet was great. The headset was wired, and it came with 2 batteries and a plug-in wall charging device. They were used, but high quality, noise canceling and when the ear muff pleather goes bad, you can replace them easily. It's been a tank for me, but they were bulky to pack when you're trying to travel lite with a carry-on and personal item. Additionally, I was ready for a wireless bluetooth solution. I will also preface that this is not my first attempt at noise canceling earbuds, I had purchased an "Amazon" off brand, on sale $49 set a couple of years back, and perhaps I didn't do something right when using them, but I just felt they plugged my ears, more so then it actually having a Noise Canceling feature (there's a difference, I'll get to that).<br/><br/>I was getting ready for a New York trip where I needed to consolidate as much space as possible, because in this particular occasion I had a carry-on and a personal item. So, I ran across, a deal where the olive color SAMSUNG Galaxy Buds 2 were going just shy of $99. Based off the reviews, it appeared to get the job done, albeit I was still a bit skeptical since the price was excellent, and I thought simply plugging the ear with a bud and filling it with music or sounds from a movie was good enough to call it noise canceling.<br/><br/>Result? I was pleasantly surprise how great these things were, there's a bit of trick to the ear buds when you don't have actual buttons to push, but it's a simple as holding your finger on the ear bud for a period of time turns on and off the noise canceling feature, and tapping the ear bud pauses it. And yes, I could tell the difference when I used the noise canceling feature, and it was freaking great in my opinion. I only used to watch a television series on my Amazon Fire Tablet, but it was fantastic, I have absolutely no complaints for the time I used it on the trip. Until I make a significantly longer trip (2 hrs for me to get to NY), I will not know how good the battery life is, or how long this product will last overall, but for $100, I highly recommend this product if you want a lean ear bud that noise cancels and sounds great watching movies and/or tv shows are your tablet.</span>

<span>These are my first galaxy buds and overall I like it but I wish the fit was better, all the ear tips would not give me a perfect fit, eventually the buds would come loose. The touch controls would "go to sleep" and I would have to remove and reinsert the buds to get the controls back. And the case is nice but there is no groove in the front to help you open the case one handed. It would have been cool if the lid could magnetically turn to open or a spring feature. If you pick this up then make sure to get it on sale like I did.</span>

<span>I absolutely love these head phones for the ambient sound option. I like being able to find the buds. The find buds doesn't work when they're in the case. My phone will tell me the battery life of the case but not where it's located. There's no option for making the buds or the case searchable when together. Go figure.</span>
