                   <h4> What People Say:</h4>
<div class="slideshow-container">
<blockquote><em><div class="a-row a-spacing-small review-data"><span class="a-size-base review-text review-text-content" data-hook="review-body">
<span>This is a long-winded review for an imperfect product with a single killer feature.<br/><br/>Instead of breaking this down by pros and cons, I'm going to go by product features as many have both pros and cons.<br/><br/>** The Single Killer Feature **<br/><br/>Hands free Alexa is nothing short of incredible, an absolute game changer. Many other earbuds can integrate with Alexa (and other assistants), but to activate you need to tap the earbuds. Being able to just talk to Alexa anywhere and everywhere is magical.<br/><br/>I've been an Apple iPhone user since the introduction of the iPhone and I love their hardware and iOS in general. However, Siri is just plain awful. It is slow, clumsy, often doesn't hear what you are saying and is so bad that I had given up on voice assistants completely. With these Echo Buds, I have now entered the world of Alexa and couldn't be more pleased. It is everything that Siri isn't -- quick, good solid responses, rarely misinterprets what I say, even understands whispers with incredible accuracy.<br/><br/>As for Alexa and the Echo Buds, this is so much more than just saying "Alexa, what's the weather?". I mainly use it to control playback of Audible books and it is truly wonderful. I can say "Alexa play titleX on Audible" and it will do so. I can say "Alexa pause" and "Alexa resume" at any time and it reacts quickly. I can say, "Alexa go back" which defaults to 30 seconds, or "Alexa go back 5 minutes" if I've let my mind wander and missed a chunk of the story.<br/><br/>The only negative of Audible and Alexa is that it streams it and won't play from the downloaded copy in my Audible iOS app. As long as I have a good cell signal, this isn't really an issue. One thing I did notice is that you have to be a little careful if you switch from using an Alexa device and the Audible app for playback. More than once I had a Whispersync failure and it lost my place. I found that force-quitting the Audible app after an Alexa session resolved this issue (in other words, listen to Audible on Alexa, force-quit Audible app, then launch Audible app and when you play a title it will auto-update to the current position).<br/><br/>I also love being able to access the Amazon Music library. I do have Prime, but not the Premium subscription to Music. It is still a lot of music and I'm happy with what I can find to listen to.<br/><br/>And live radio stations such as NPR work great. The first time you say, "Alexa play NPR" it will ask what station you want, so you can get your local / preferred station. Afterwards, just saying "Alexa play NPR" auto-selects that station.<br/><br/>There is an annoyance with the way Alexa works with third-party, non-Alexa-integrated apps. For example, if I launch a random radio, music, whatever app, it will play fine, and if I say, "Alexa pause" it will pause, but if I then say "Alexa play" it will start playing the default music app assigned to Alexa. In this case, the only way to pause/play is to tap on the earbuds.<br/><br/>** Alexa app &amp; privacy **<br/><br/>I've seen numerous reviews complaining that location access and/or contacts are required to use the earbuds. In my experience, this is NOT the case. I did not allow location access or contacts access (iOS Alexa app) and had zero problems with setting up and using the Echo Buds.<br/><br/>** The fit of the earbuds **<br/><br/>I find that the earbuds fit quite well and the built-in audio test always gives me good to excellent rating on fit. I am using the default medium (blue) ear tips and the small wings. I find I need the wings to give a more secure fit when I am out hiking. I have also found that to get a solid fit, there is a specific technique I need to use to get the earbud tip securely in my ear canal before twisting it into position. I can't describe this in words, but if you don't get this right, the fit will be sloppy.<br/><br/>** Touch Controls **<br/><br/>Two observations: 1) They don't work consistently well for me. I will tap once and often register no tap at all or it will register as a double-tap. This is annoying. 2) The only tap gesture you can customize is the long-press. I don't know why you can't customize all the tap gestures. Perhaps in a software update...<br/><br/>** Battery life **<br/><br/>This is a very mixed bag. Overall, I find that I usually get closer to 4 hours of battery life instead of the stated 5 hours. This may be due to volume (I have it about 2/3 of max volume and the Amazon battery testing was done at 50% volume). It also may be that I keep the passthrough mode enabled and am usually in a fairly noisy environment (hiking outdoors, wind noise, etc). I think, but am not 100% sure, that more noise means more processing is required and this eats into battery life.<br/><br/>That being said, popping them into the case for 15 minutes quickly recharges them enough for another hour of two of use.<br/><br/>The case only holds two full charges, which isn't a lot, so I always charge the case after an extended session of use.<br/><br/>One important note is that Amazon shows the battery life of both the left and right earbuds. You'll notice that one bud will drain MUCH quicker than the other. This has to do with which bud is the primary vs secondary. The primary actually communicates with the phone's Bluetooth and then processes and sends a signal over to the secondary. I often find that the primary bud is 15% more drained than the secondary. You can control which bud is primary vs secondary by which one you put in first, but this can be tricky sometimes. I've done some testing and can reliably get the left or right bud to be the primary (and thus drain faster).<br/><br/>** The case **<br/><br/>I think the case is really nice. It is small and slim enough to fit into the coin pocket in my pants without bulging too much. One little annoyance is that the lid flips closed too easily, but that is a minor thing. Even with the small wings installed, I have absolutely no problem with getting a solid charge connection every time.<br/><br/>I have experienced a glitch in how the charging seems to work. If I open the case when one bud is fully charged but the other is not, it seems to stop charging even when I close the case again. However, if I just put the buds in the case and leave it alone for a while, both buds are always charged to 100%.<br/><br/>** Sound quality **<br/><br/>I think it is quite good! Sure, there are much better sounding buds, for a lot more money. These have decent bass, midrange and treble and sound good with music as well as spoken word (Audible books, podcasts).<br/><br/>** Active Noise Cancellation (ANC) and Passthrough Mode **<br/><br/>I think the ANC is just "okay", nothing great. It does work to limit some noise, but I can still hear most everything, just at a lower volume. Part of this is due to the nature of an earbud not having a complete seal into the ear canal, but part of it is probably less processing power than some of the major players in this market.<br/><br/>I use the Passthrough mode often. I do a lot of hiking in a desert environment and need to be aware of animals, particularly rattlesnakes. The Passthrough seems to accentuate treble sounds, which is perfect to hear a rattler. I have it set at level 4, and there is a little hiss, but nothing I find overly annoying.<br/><br/>I do wish there was a way to quickly disable all noise processing (i.e., turn it off) without having to open the Alexa app on my phone. For example, a 3-way toggle with long-press would work -- ANC, Passthrough, Off.<br/><br/>** Conclusion **<br/><br/>There really are quite a few things to nitpick on these earbuds. They are far from perfect and some cheaper buds (half the price of even less) have overall better functionality. HOWEVER, as I mentioned at the beginning of this feature, Hands Free Alexa is a KILLER feature and, for me, so awesome that I am easily willing to overlook all the negatives. I do hope that Amazon keeps improving these and that the 3rd generation fixes a lot of the issues. Perhaps a software update in the meantime will help with some things.</span>

<span>This was so disappointing. It emits an unnecessary white noise (aka whoosh sound, sounds like vacuum is turned on, humming noise, sound of TV static, whatever you want to call it). If ANC is on, you’ll probably hear it a lot less, enough to not even notice it at all (unless you know what to listen for). But if you have Passthrough on, you’ll notice it immediately. You don’t even have to try. It’s so unnecessary. I don’t even know why there is even white noise! I thought it was defective so I requested a replacement, only to find the second pair with exactly the same white noise. What’s even more disturbing about this is that every review from influencers and early reviewers all said how wonderful this is WITHOUT a single mention about the white noise. What, so you’re given a free pair so you have nothing bad to say about it? This white noise is so loud that having Passthrough on seems pointless. With this white noise, I have trouble hearing the fine details of what’s going on around me, and the whole point of having Passthrough is so that you CAN hear what’s going on around you as if you aren’t wearing ear buds at all. For example, I was walking the dogs when my non-subtle wife walks up to me and startles me because I couldn’t hear the shuffling of her feet as she approached me. I don’t have this problem with my airpods pro. Can you imagine if this was an off-leash dog? Or a strange man!? I only bought these earbuds because of the passthrough feature. It’s like a safety thing for going on walks by ourselves and crossing streets safely, to name a few examples.<br/><br/>Good news is, there are plenty of Pros:<br/>I will say that it’s the most comfortable ear buds ever. I can leave it in my ears and it stays in and stays comfortable the entire time – for hours. Even though at first I was confused how to put these in my ears and it felt like it was going to fall out, I quickly got used to it and it stays put like a charm. But like I said, that white noise. Once I take off the ear buds, I feel a sense of total quietness and it’s deafening… because that’s how loud the white noise was when I have it in my ears for hours at a time.<br/><br/>The Alexa feature (as in calling her up whenever and wherever) is the selling point of these for me. I’m grilling or cooking or walking the dogs or playing with the kids, and both hands are completely occupied. All I have to do is mutter her name and ask her to set timers, play music, read my news, set reminders, etc. And because she’s in my ear, she’s always with me. I never miss a timer or an alert because I’m in another room or left my phone in another room closeby. It’s so dang convenient! I absolutely LOVE IT. The only things she can’t do are my native phone things like reading my texts and responding to them for me.<br/><br/>Set up is really easy and quite seamless once you’ve paired it once. The settings on it are limited, but it has a lot more settings I can mess with than most ear buds – which is great for people like me who prefers to customize certain things. Like being able to customize just the left side’s long press to call up my phone’s native assistant (iphone is Siri), or adjusting Passthrough volume, or turning on/off Sidetone which allows you to hear your own voice on a call.<br/><br/>The battery life on this is great. You can’t go wrong with a battery capacity of 15 hours on the charging case. 5 hours on the earbuds are more than enough for a long walk and workout, if that’s you. I do like that the earbuds magnetically snap into place inside it’s charging case. That feels great! The one I got is also wireless charging. I love wireless charging. I like no cables.<br/><br/>The music on this sounds really good. It’s great actually. The bass is good, the sound is rich. I’m jamming to my music with these ear buds 2 as I’m typing up this review.<br/><br/>The noise cancelling is okay… I don’t have anything to complain about because it’s the same as my airpods pro. Even with my airpods pro though, I have yet to encounter any noise cancelling earbuds that work better than noise cancelling headphones. I can still hear the clacking away. I can still hear my vacuum, dogs, and TV. Even my cheap-o $25 kid headphones cancel noise much better than my airpods pro. Maybe it’s the shape of my ear canals, I don’t know. So… noise cancelling on these ear buds are truly just as good as expensive airpods pro to me.<br/><br/>The other Cons:<br/>Even though they’re comfortable, they feel a bit flimsy. Even the case feels a bit flimsy. While “feeling” flimsy is hardly a crime, I do wonder how well these can fair up over time of everyday use. Also, I keep accidently pressing the touch-buttons whenever I put the ear buds on or taking them off. Over time, I no longer cared because my fingers have nowhere to go. I have to inevitably touch the touch-buttons – so I don’t actually think this is a con. It’s more like a matter-of-fact.<br/><br/>At the end of the day, the biggest con is the white noise. And here I rant again… I would have never bought this had I known. I can’t return it either because it’s a freaking anniversary gift. No matter how I tell my wife that it’s okay to return it, she won’t because it’s an anniversary gift. And that makes me so pissed at those unreliable and dishonest early-reviewers (one of whom was CNET!) who didn’t know what they were talking about and only gave sparkling reviews because they were given a free pair. My only hope is that later updates will completely remove this annoying noise. I can find absolutely NO ONE who can tell me WHY this white noise is even necessary in these ear buds when other ear buds with Passthrough have absolutely no need for such a useless and non-optional sound.<br/><br/>Overall:<br/>I do have a lot of good things to say about this product, and the main PRO is the Alexa feature which I’m completely in love with because I’m such busy person and she’s so helpful… BUT I can’t get over the white noise, especially coming from owning Air Pods Pro where the Passthrough is completely quiet with no white noise at all. Why is the white noise even necessary? It’s annoying as heck! And the fact that early reviewers from top reviewers and influencers never mentioning this irks the heck out of me. If I had the choice, would I get these again? If they removed the white noise, 100% yes – they are absolutely great for their price (other than the white noise). If they keep these white noise though, this will be one of my biggest purchase-regrets I’ve ever made.</span>

<span>Pros:<br/>Earbuds stay in ear during running even with heavy sweat<br/>Very good sound quality, especially for earbuds<br/>Tap controls work well (except in rain)<br/>App works well for device setup and settings management<br/><br/>Cons:<br/>Not reliable to use in rain<br/>Active Noise Cancellation (ANC) inconsistent<br/>Poor sound isolation in the device itself<br/>300MB app that can use over 500MB of memory, may slow down some phones<br/>Potential privacy issues (app wants access to lots of data)<br/><br/>Neutral (pro/con depends on your perspective):<br/>Many extra features in app that may be useful to some people<br/>Alexa Hands-Free support<br/><br/>FYI: I am using the Echo earbuds on a Samsung Galaxy S9 Android phone.<br/><br/>General impression:<br/><br/>My primary use for earbuds is to listen to a wide range of content while exercising, and especially when running. Every earbud I have tried previously - wired or wireless - tends to fall out of my right ear when I get sweaty. No combination of inserts and eartips has solved this issue for me.<br/><br/>Fortunately, the Echo earbuds are a strong improvement. I have exercised a half-dozen times using these earbuds. The earbuds stayed firmly in my ear even when sweating heavily thanks to the eartip design along with the helpful setup &amp; testing walkthrough. The earbuds are not the most comfortable I have used, but it is more important to me to keep the device in my ear. An earbud did fall out once when running in moderate rain – I will discuss problems with rain below.<br/><br/>Audio quality for music is very good with excellent frequency range for earbuds. I listen to rock, pop, and classical music and am happy with the music quality. I am especially happy with the range of voices I can hear in classical music. I have not adjusted the equalizer in the app.<br/><br/>Audio quality for audiobooks/podcasts is good, but not great. Spoken audio is not as clear and crisp as I would like. I have not adjusted the equalizer in the app, but I do not expect them to help because almost all spoken audio will be controlled by a single equalizer slider. Active Noise Cancellation (ANC) can help when it works well, but is inconsistent as described below.<br/><br/>Battery life is long enough that I do not notice. I can listen to music &amp; talk on the phone for hours and the earbuds still have over 50% battery. I could use these 4-5 hours a day and make it through a work week. However, I have all advanced features disabled, so this is best-case battery life.<br/><br/>Using Echo earbuds for phone calls and work meetings:<br/><br/>These earbuds generally work well for calls. The audio I hear is good - perhaps slightly better than the audiobook/podcast audio I mentioned above. The other people on the phone call can hear me well. There are a couple of caveats:<br/><br/>1. The beamforming microphones are not exceptional - the people on the phone call can hear some of the noises around me.<br/>2. If you have passthrough enabled, the other person on the call will hear all of the passthrough content.<br/><br/>A couple times I have had issues where it sounds like I drop out of the call briefly, or where the audio is clearly delayed. I have not verified that the issues are caused by the Echo earbuds, but it happened in locations where I have not had problems with other bluetooth devices.<br/><br/>Using Echo earbuds in the rain:<br/><br/>I was caught in moderate rain during one of my runs with the Echo earbuds. This caused two problems:<br/><br/>1. The right earbud fell out once<br/>2. The water triggered the "tap" actions<br/><br/>I went into the app and disabled all of the "tap" actions to work around the 2nd issue.<br/><br/>Amazon Alexa and Setup:<br/><br/>The Amazon Alexa android app is very large, nearly 300MB, has used over 500MB of memory, and has far more functionality than is needed to manage earbud settings. I generally view this as a negative. There are some interesting features that may take the place of other apps you use and provide niche benefits when with the Echo earbuds. However, most of them seem to be designed to provide more of your personal data to Amazon. I have dismissed/disabled all of those extra features.<br/><br/>As other reviewers have mentioned, you must enable location sharing when you activate the Echo earbuds. Fortunately, I was able to revoke that permission after earbud activation and have seen no negative impact on functionality. I have also disabled Alexa Hands-Free and have not seen any evidence that the device is listening for verbal commands.<br/><br/>I like how the app walked through device pairing, device setup, and testing for fit except for location sharing being required. For me, the eartips are a pain to pull onto each earbud. It took me a minute or two per eartip per earbud, and I chose the wrong eartip initially. The tight fit is probably good in the long-term but is annoying in the short-term.<br/><br/>The app used a lot of battery power during the initial setup. Power usage has been negligble since then.<br/><br/>There is an Amazon Alexa notification bar item whenever the Echo earbuds are connected. This entry is a waste for most users. It duplicates the bluetooth OS notification, and selecting it does nothing. It would be useful if selecting it took you to the earbuds setting screen. Amazon probably includes this notification item to prevent the OS from auto-closing the app in the background, which may be needed for some of the app features. However, I don't use those features, so I would prefer not to have the notification bar clutter.<br/><br/>Another frustration is the app takes about five seconds to recognize that the Echo earbuds are connected before the earbud settings become accessible within the app. This happens every time the app is opened, even if the app was opened ten seconds earlier and the earbuds were connected the entire time. The notification bar item telling me the earbuds are connected is present - why are the earbud settings not immediately available in the app?<br/><br/>I like how Active Noise Cancellation (ANC) and Passthrough are managed in the settings. Unfortunately, I do not get much value from either one.<br/><br/>- Passthrough works quite well, but these earbuds do not provide enough sound isolation to need passthrough at the listening volumes that I use. There is so much sound leakage through the earbuds that I can hear what is happening around me while running outdoors without using passthrough. On occasion, passthrough also adds noise on the higher settings.<br/><br/>- ANC is inconsistent. In some situations it works well - that is, I hear less background noise and I don't notice it. In other situations I can "hear" the ANC, including shifts in the compensation, and it seems like the devices are applying maximum ANC even when it is not needed. Hopefully a software update can improve the consistency of ANC. As a workaround, an option to manually control the amount of ANC would help.<br/><br/>Conclusion:<br/><br/>Overall I like these earbuds. They are the best earbuds I have tested for running, and I will keep using them for running and exercising except when I am in rain. I am hopeful that future updates will make Active Noise Cancellation (ANC) more consistent and enjoyable.</span>

<span>It's rare that I order a first release tech product. I ususally wait a while to let others work out the kinks and force the manufacturers to upgrade the firmware.<br/><br/>I should have stuck to my policy with the 2nd Gen Echo Buds and waited a while. When I saw that $99 price tag though, I couldn't resist. I figured I would either pass down my Airpods Pro or the Echo Buds to my wife if the Buds were worth the money. (She has a lousy pair of no-name knock-offs that she got from answering a survey online that look like Apple Airpods but sound like a kazoo.)<br/><br/>It's not that the 2nd Gen Echo Buds aren't comfortable, though for me they failed in that department. The second I took them out of the package and tried them on, I knew I need to work on the fit. Confession time. I have different sized ear canals. I usually need to use a medium bud on the left and a large bud on the right. This time, it was more than just a bud size issue. They kept falling out of my ears no matter what size bud I tried.<br/><br/>So I tried to add the extra rubber (maybe silicone?) spacers to give them more grip. No joy. Correction, I should say I couldn't even get the spacers to go on the buds. I never actually got to test them.<br/><br/>But I figured maybe it was a matter of breaking in the buds to see if they adapted to my ears over time. So I wore them for a while and tested them under a variety of situations.<br/><br/>That's when I discovered the fatal flaw.<br/><br/>No, the audio quality was okay. Not the best I've ever heard, not the worst. My Sony WF-1000XM3s have the best overall audio quality of any noise cancelling buds I've tried, with solid (if not thundering) lows and dialed-in mids and highs. The 2nd Gen Echo buds were kind of "meh" throughout the whole range. I listen to classical, jazz, and classic rock most days, and not one of my favorite songs or composers jumped out at me, no matter the quality of the original.<br/><br/>No, the noise cancellation was actually quite good. As active noise cancellation goes, my Airpods Pro still hold the title, with the Sony WF-1000XM3s coming in a close second. Of course, for *real* noise cancellation you need to jump up to over-the-ear cans like the Sony WM-1000XM4s or a pair of Bose 700s, (I still prefer and use Bose QC35s as my daily drivers for the right balance of comfort and NC). Even so, the active cancellation on the 2nd Gen Echo Buds was probably the best on the market at this price point.<br/><br/>The flaw was something I discovered while driving on a long-distance trip where I had to hold a conference call from the car.<br/><br/>The second I tapped into a Teams call from the car - in VoIP quality, not dial-in quality - the complaints started rolling in.<br/><br/>"Hey, where are you? You sound like you're in a wind tunnel."<br/><br/>Hmmm. Good thing I brought my Airpods Pro with me.<br/><br/>"The wind noise is gone. Now you sound great."<br/><br/>"No wind?"<br/><br/>"Nope. You sound nice and natural."<br/><br/>Okay, maybe it was a fluke. Maybe it was the AC vents blasting straight into the mics on the Buds.<br/><br/>Nope. Every time I tried a call, whether Teams VoIP, dial-up, Skype, or Facetime I got the same complaints.<br/><br/>"What's all that background noise?" "What's all that fan noise?" "Where are you?"<br/><br/>And thus, after just a few days of use and a TON of tinkering to try every setting in the Alexa app to tune the buds, I threw in the towel and sent them back.<br/><br/>So why, you may ask, do I not use the Sony WF-1000XM3s more often if they have such great sound? Good question. In addition to having generally good (though not great) Active NC and isolation, and the best pure audio quality of the buds I've tested, they also happen to be pretty solid on calls, too. I tried them out on that same conference call on that same long drive and they got even better call reports from my colleagues. It's just that the Sony's have a penchant for falling out of my ears when I can least afford it. The odd shape of the Sony's means that they don't tuck into the ear. They just sit in it. And without hooks, they always drop away when I least expect it. I really can't use them unless I'm sitting in the office or doing other non-strenuous activity.<br/><br/>So why did I even consider anything else after using the Airpods Pro? Now I'm asking myself the same question and you should, too. The Airpods Pro may have the best Active NC of any ear buds on the market. The audio quality is good, although not earth shattering. But they never fall out and they never disappoint when I'm on a call. I put miles and miles on when I bike, over some fairly rugged terrain, and I have never, not once, worried that my Airpods were going to fall out of my ears. Yes, they lose the seal every now and then, but no, they have never fallen out.<br/><br/>So the story of the 2nd Gen Echo Buds is that they are...<br/><br/>* Not always a comfortable fit.<br/>* Not the best audio quality.<br/>and<br/>* They pick up too much external noise during calls.<br/><br/>At the price, they may be right for some users. Your ear might be ready for the way they fit. You might be ready to give the "nothing-stellar" audio quality a pass a this price. You might never place calls that depend on background noise reduction.<br/><br/>But go in with your eyes open. They're okay, but they're not ground breaking.</span>

<div class="slideshow-container">
<blockquote><em><div class="a-row a-spacing-small review-data"><span class="a-size-base review-text review-text-content" data-hook="review-body">
<span>(This is a lengthy review, so in case you are short on time I have included a quick Pros/Cons summary at the top.  This gives an idea of my overall opinions, but for more details continue to read on below.)<br/>(Note- I will mostly be comparing these to other earbuds that I have used and/or reviewed recently: AirPods Pro, Samsung Galaxy Buds Pro, Sony WF-1000XM4, Echo Buds2, and Klipsch T5 II )<br/><br/>THE GOOD:<br/>--Comfort/Fit:  So far, these are very comfortable to wear.  They are slightly smaller than some of the other earbuds I've tested, and are up there with Airpods Pro in terms of comfort.  They also feel very secure in the ear, unlike some other brands.  No complaints here with comfort/design.<br/><br/>--Mic Quality:  The mic quality of these is excellent.  I tested out with calling friends, and these were either 1st or 2nd best sounding earbuds according to the people I called.  My friend says that these mics are the best out the earbuds we tested in this range.<br/><br/>--Multiple Ecosystem Support:  These work well with all ecosystems, whether you are using Apple or Android; and with assistants including Alexa and Google.<br/><br/>--Good ANC :  The noise canceling on these is also fantastic.  This technology has come a long way, and sometimes it can be hard to compare ANC, since each company produces earbuds that prioritize blocking out slightly different frequencies.  To me these seem like they are close to the best , but maybe the XM4s and Airpods Pro are SLIGHTLY better, especially the XM4s at low frequency ranges.  The Adaptive Sound Control is a neat feature that can change ambient sound settings based on your location, though I'm not sure how useful this will be in practice.<br/><br/>THE BAD:<br/><br/>--Overall Sound Comparison:  With the default EQ settings, the overall sound quality actually seems slightly worse than the WF1000XM4s to me.  I also prefer the sound of the Klipsch T5 IIs with most music, and even the Galaxy Pros with some songs; as these LinkBuds S can sometimes sound slightly muffled or dampened in comparison.  Still good quality sound overall, just not as good as some of the other options in this range, and not my favorite with any type of music I tested.<br/><br/>--No Wireless Charging:  This seems like a big disappointment for this price range.  I would expect that ALL earbuds that are over $200 should have wireless charging at this point.<br/><br/>MORE DETAILS:<br/>Here are my thoughts on each category, again mostly comparing to:  Airpods Pro, Samsung Galaxy Buds Pro, Sony WF-1000XM4, Echo Buds2, and Klipsch T5 II.  (I also enlisted the help of a friend of mine that is an Audio Engineer, to give his opinions and to use some of his equipment.)<br/><br/>Sound -  These sounded great to me when I first put them in and listened to a variety of music.  I was not disappointed in overall sound quality at all, and if you aren't comparing these to anything else, you will also probably think that they sound great.  It was only after rigorously measuring their output with my friend's mics, and also repeatedly comparing them to all of the other earbuds,  that I was able to notice the slightly muffled sound compared to the other earbuds.  The Airpods Pro, Klipsch T5 II, XM4, and Galaxy Pro all seem slightly more “clear”, with a broader range.  The midrange on the Airpods Pro might be the biggest difference here, and when I switched back and forth between them I felt like I was missing some of those midrange frequencies with the LinkBuds S.  Overall sound range/EQ preferences are of course very subjective and personal, but my friend and I both agree that these are definitively not our favorite in this category.<br/><br/>Design/Fit – I like the way that these fit in my ear, and they are right up there at the top with Airpods and Klipsch in terms of being lightweight and comfortable.  For me, the Galaxy Pros were a little to clunky and felt like they might fall out sometimes, but the LinkBuds S fit great while also feeling secure.  The texture of the buds themselves is almost a little scratchy, which took me a little while to get used to, but I think I prefer this texture for touch sensitivity.  For me though, I have always preferred the press-able buttons on the Klipsch T5 IIs over all of these touch sensors, partly because I often wear a headband over the earbuds and a sweaty headband can mess with the touch sensors sometimes.<br/><br/>Calls – This is probably the best overall feature of these earbuds.  The microphone quality seemed to be the best out of all the earbuds when testing out on my friend's equipment, and in real-world testing I experienced similar results.  These were either the best sounding, or a close second best when compared to other earbuds when making calls.  These sounded the best in almost every environment, maybe tied for best with Klipsch in noisy/windy environments.<br/><br/>Water Resistance - These have the same IPX4 rating as most of the other earbuds, but note that the Galaxy Buds Pro have a superior IPX7 rating, if that matters to you.  So far these have been working great for exercise, but again personally I prefer more headband-friendly designs sometimes.<br/><br/>Charging/etc:  These charge at about the same speed as the other earbuds, and have a similar battery life.  The BIG difference is that these don't support wireless charging, which seems odd at this price range.  These come with a short 9 inch usb-A to usb-C cable in the box, no plug/brick.  This is my least favorite in terms of charging options compared to the other earbuds in this price range.<br/><br/>OVERALL:  These are solid earbuds that feel great, produce good sound, have good ANC, and have excellent microphones for great call quality.  They do just about everything well, but at this current price I can't say that they are my favorite, or even the best value.  Overall my favorites are probably still the Klipsch T5 IIs, which are currently less expensive than these LinkBuds S earbuds at the time I'm writing this.  My second favorite would either be the Galaxy Pros or the Airpod Pros, both of which are slightly less expensive and produce slightly better sound in my opinion.  The only thing these LinkBuds S are the best at seems to be the mic/call quality, but even then the difference there isn't big enough for me to recommend choosing them overall.  Personally I'm sticking with my Klipsch T5 IIs for regular use, but if you are a diehard Apple user, I would have recommend the Airpods Pro over these LinkBuds S at the current prices.  If these drop in price in the future and are competitively priced with some of the other options, then they might be a good choice; especially if switching back and forth between ecosystems is important to you and you don't mind the lack of wireless charging.</span>

<span>So, a few key things to say about this product, and how I use it. This rating is purely based on my experience with it.<br/><br/>On my end, first, I went with a refurbished version. Second, I'll easily use them 8-12 hours a day, definitely more than some people. 3rd, I'm often in somewhat louder environments.<br/><br/>How have these Sony earbuds held up? A few weeks in, I have had some serious issues with the noise cancelling aspect. Sometimes, one or both earbuds will give loud, high pitched,  static or feedback. The only thing that seemed to 'fix' that issue is by putting both bids back into the case to reset them. The other option is actually to turn the noise cancelling off in the app. I'd say that's the biggest issue.<br/><br/>A somewhat minor problem is, the app almost gets in the way more than it helps. I cannot leave the Adaptive Sound Control on, as it changes my settings too often. I prefer to use the Ambient Sound Control (single tap) option, but then you cannot turn off noise cancelling altogether to fix the giant feedback issue. Not really as important is the battery life. Often, I will only get 5 hours in before having to charge them. If I could run noise cancelling on, it actually extends battery life by being able to turn the volume down. Issues have arisen there, however.<br/><br/>I actually Really like how quickly they charge, though. Really did great there. The equalizer included within the app feels decent enough, and the sound is about as good as I've heard.<br/><br/>In all, I do not know if I would say these were worth the money I spent on them. Some issues may have been the fact I went with refurbished, but if it is certified refurbished, then that's Sony endorsed. If they don't want me complaining about issues on a refurbished product, tighten those reins. If they chopped the full price for new ones in half (closer to $100-$110), I'd definitely go for them.</span>

<span>Let me start of by saying that these earbuds have good sound quality , are super light and have decent battery life I can wear these the entire day and not even feel they are there<br/><br/>But it does have some issues one of the earbuds sometimes doesn't connect and someone's disconnects while music is playing I'm sure this is some glitch but for such high priced earbuds should not be an issue , overall still good headphones perfect for working out</span>

<span>Linkbuds S I am using are connected to my PC, android phone and iphone. They are very easy to switch between three devices. On PC I use it for Teams. These sounds very natural for calling and never notcied any disruption.

Noise cancellation and transparency mode are very good.<br/><br/>I feel they lack the support to stay connected with two devices at the same time. They are still the best.</span>

<span>We have several Wyze products in our home, so when I saw the earbuds, I decided to try them. I was expecting them to be of the same outstanding quality of our other Wyze products, so I am very disappointed to find out they aren’t.<br/>  I mainly use a single earbud at work. The environment is loud and I need to be able to hear alerts from my phone right away when one of my team is trying to reach me. I rarely  play music or anything else, just wear it for alerts. Tonight is the second night I have used the Wyze earbud and after only four hours, I got the alert telling me there was only 20% battery life left and to put on the charger.  Maybe that is considered to be a lot by some standards, but I have used several different earbuds over the years and I usually get through my 12 hour shift on one charge when just monitoring my phone and a minimum of 8 hours when listening to music or podcasts.<br/>  These earbuds just don’t live up to the standard I have come to expect from Wyze.</span>

<span>I have 9 Wyze cams. So, I really wanted to like these Wyze Buds. And at first I did. But there proved to be one too many issues. My main reason for purchasing these were strictly for work video calls on Microsoft Teams. I have Apple AirPods Pro, and because I have two MacBooks on my desk and an iPhone, the AirPods would sometimes randomly switch between devices, even during video calls. So I bought these just for work use. The first issue I noticed was a slight lag in audio between the person's lips moving and the audio to the earbuds during Teams calls. This only happened when I had the audio input as another device, such as my USB condenser mic. If I switched the audio input to the Wyze buds, it was in sync. However, I paid good money for my mic, so that's a hard pass using the Buds mic instead of the condenser mic. I was willing to overlook that and deal with the lag. But at random times the audio just drops. It's only for, like, 2-3 seconds, but it got embarrassing saying, "Sorry, what did you just say? My audio cut out". That's too much to deal with for me personally.<br/><br/>Overall, the build is good, the audio is not bad for the price point, but in the end, I ended up returning them.</span>

                   <h4> What People Say:</h4>
<div class="slideshow-container">
<blockquote><em><div class="a-row a-spacing-small review-data"><span class="a-size-base review-text review-text-content" data-hook="review-body">
<span>The Sony WF-1000MX4s are Sony's latest ‘true wireless’ (TWS) earphones meaning that each earpiece is completely separate and not connected by wires. The WF-1000MX4s behave like ‘typical’ TWS earphones and are stored in a charging case between uses which carries enough juice to charge the earphones several times over. Sony's previous TWS earphones were the acclaimed WF-1000MX3s that I really enjoyed so I was really excited when the WF-1000MX4s came out. I’ve spent several weeks listening to and testing the WF-1000MX4s and here are my thoughts.<br/><br/>- Sound: I’m pleased to report that the WF-1000MX4s sound excellent, albeit with a caveat. They offer excellent detail and good imaging for a pair of earphones. Instruments come through clear and there’s a good degree of separation. The earphones also support the highest quality codecs available on Android and iOS (LDAC and AAC, respectively), which means that Bluetooth compression should have as little impact on sound quality as is currently feasible. Indeed, in my tests I couldn’t tell the difference in sound quality between the LDAC-connected WF-1000MX4s and a good pair of wired earphones plugged into a LDAC-connected Bluetooth amp. However, despite all the technical aspects of these earphones working so well, the tuning ends up being a bit of a let down. The default tuning on these earphones is very bass-heavy. While some might enjoy this, it’s definitely not a natural or balanced sound and lacks treble. The good news is that the default tuning is a good middle ground for accommodating a variety of media. I found that I could still enjoy listening to music with it and it removed a lot of harshness from some of the less well-produced podcasts I listen to. The lack of treble also made the earphones non-fatiguing and allowed me to listen for hours on end without issue. For most people I think it will be just fine. However, in my case I ended up preferring to use the equalizer included in Sony's headphones app for listening to music for long periods. I found the ‘treble boost' to be the best for me. It should be noted that the EQ setting is remembered by the earphones so it will carry over even if you connect them to a computer or digital audio player that doesn’t have the app. It’s annoying to have to jump through these hoops but I think that ultimately people who care about the tuning will appreciate the customization, while people who don’t won’t be bothered by the overly-bassy default presentation. With this caveat aside, the WF-1000MX4s sound excellent.<br/><br/>- Noise Canceling (NC): the active NC on these earphones is class-leading and re-enforced by a couple of tricks that Sony has implemented. The NC can’t match up to the NC on a full size pair of headphones and doesn’t block quite as much as wired Bluetooth earphones (e.g. Sony's own WI-1000MX models). However, it’s not too far off. It’s also noticeably better than the NC that other TWS earphones in the $100-$200 range come equipped with and certainly a step up from what the WF-1000MX3 offered. This level of NC will allow you to comfortably listen to the earphones in an environment where there are high levels of constant background noise (background office chatter, fans whirring, train noise, etc.) In my experience this means that any background noise is still audible with music turned off but becomes unnoticeable when listening to music. What the NC won’t do is block out variable external noise (e.g. someone having a conversation next to you). However, Sony did improve the passive noise isolation with this model by including hybrid foam tips that are noticeably better at blocking out external noise than the tips supplied with previous Sony earphones. Additionally, turning on NC does increase the bass somewhat, which helps mask low frequency sounds. The combination of improved NC, improved passive isolation, and noise masking, makes these earphones excellent at blocking out external noise.<br/><br/>- Controls: Sony opts for a simple, but effective control scheme on the WF-1000MX4s. The earpieces are controlled by tapping/pressing the outside of the earphones. The exact function of the taps/presses on each earpiece can be set in Sony's companion app for the earphones. While the functions aren’t completely customizable (you get to assign pre-programmed sets of functions to each earpiece) I had no issue getting the earphones set up with a control scheme that made sense to me. The touch sensor is in the center of the housing at the peak of the subtle mound. It’s also fairly large, which makes it hard to miss. That said, there’s no obvious indicator of where the touch sensitive area begins and ends so I did find that I had to consciously aim for the center of the earpiece to make sure my commands registered. All in all this means that it’s generally easy to control the buds, but there might still be a brief adjustment period.<br/><br/>- Ergonomics: these are large earphones that surprised me by being a lot more comfortable than I first thought they would be. While the large size wouldn’t have been surprising a few years ago, the recent trend towards smaller and smaller TWS earphones means the WF-1000MX4s are definitely outliers. They’re smaller than the WF-1000MX3s (though that’s not saying much) but the more compact design makes them feel a lot smaller by comparison than they actually are. When worn, the body of these earphones sits above the concha bowl, held in place by the firm fit of the nozzle in the ear canal. This means that the earphones protrude outwards more than they need to. However, by minimizing the number of points of contact with the outer ear they offer a fit that is incredibly comfortable and is likely to be acceptable to a wide range of ear shapes. So, although the earphones are large and do protrude more than a typical pair of TWS earphones, the design makes the fit incredibly comfortable.<br/><br/>- Other features: the ambient sound feature (pass-through of external audio) on Sony earphones is still the best there is. This feature is now relatively common on TWS earphones but Sony's execution is still much better than most of the competition. What sets Sony's implementation apart is that it feels and sounds quite natural. There is no significant background hissing or exaggerated amplification of low level noise. Instead, this is something you can leave on an forget about. I find this really useful for any situation where I need to be aware of my surroundings but still want to listen to music (e.g. while exercising). You can also activate this feature temporarily by pressing and holding one of the earpieces. You can also have this feature activate automatically when talking, but I found that it was either under- or over-sensitive and never quite struck the sweet spot needed for it to be useful. There are other features (e.g. 360 Reality Audio) but I think ambient sound is the one most people will actually use and it is a feature that Sony happens to do better than the competition.<br/><br/>- Accessories: The accessories are a little disappointing. While the case is much smaller than the previous WF-1000MX3 case, it is still larger than the typical TWS earphone. Sony also included new foam hybrid tips with this new model that isolate better. However, only 3 sizes of tips are included and the largest are just a touch smaller than I would like. It’s a little disappointing that Sony skimped on accessories here. Fortunately the nozzle is identical to the WF-1000MX3 so the older Sony tips fit just fine, as do a range of replacement options. I personally recommend Comply's TrueGrip Pro for Sony true wireless, which allowed me to get a really firm seal that took the comfort up a level. Overall the case is fine and the lack of tip options is a definite misstep, but one that is readily rectified.<br/><br/>- Other: the mic works just fine for calls. Battery life is as advertised. Everything that needs to work does indeed work. While I have seen some reports of intermittent connectivity issues I had no such problems myself.<br/><br/>Taking all of these aspects into account, I rate the WF-1000MX4s 5/5 and would argue they are the best TWS earphone on the market. The fact that they are the first TWS earphones to support the LDAC codec means that it shouldn’t be possible for any other TWS earphones to beat them for sound quality on an Android-based operating system. From my listening to them I definitely did find this to be the case. I am disappointed in the default tuning of the earphones and the dearth of included tips, but I don’t think most people will care that much. I think people who do care (like myself) will probably enjoy the included EQ within the app and will already have spare tips they can readily swap out for. Either way, neither of these complaints are enough to drop the WF-1000MX4s down from a 5/5 rating – they are simply the best TWS earphones I’ve ever listened to and one of the best earphones (of all categories) I’ve ever tried.</span>

<span>UPDATE IV:<br/>.<br/>After several months with many other earbuds, I decided to go back and order a refurbished pair.  At under half the MSRP, I'm happy to live with the issues listed below just for the ANC and sound.<br/>.<br/>UPDATE III:  Rating reduced from 4 to 2 and now to 1 Star!<br/>I just received my third set, hoping the issues I highlighted below are quality and not design related.<br/>Unfortunately, they are inherent design issues.<br/>The third set of XM4 buds have the same dinging tone when you bang your teeth / a slight echo with the same tone when listening to podcasts/the Assistant voice and the same call quality; from a noisy place it's so bad they are essentially unusable for any meaningful conversation.<br/>.<br/>In a final conclusion, I am sorely disappointed in the performance of what is clearly an over-hyped and over-priced Sony "premium" product.<br/>With what it does well, it excels.  With what it does poorly, it sucks!<br/>No bud is perfect, but even sub-$100 buds do a better all around job than these Sony WF-1000XM4's.  I cannot justify $248 for these just for the ANC and sound quality, which I'll miss.  I can have almost as good for much less money.<br/>I really can't recommend these to anyone without money to waste.<br/>.<br/>.<br/>UPDATE II:  Rating reduced from 4 Stars to 2 Stars!<br/>.<br/>I made a phone call on the WF1000-XM4 in a VERY noisy place and the other end said they couldn't hear me at all well.  I was distant and muffled amongst all the ambient noise that could be heard from where I was calling.  The XM4 was essentially useless in these conditions.  Others online report a similar issue.<br/>I called back using my Galaxy Buds Pro and was crystal clear with almost no ambient noise in the background.  Just like it should be.  C'mon Sony!!<br/>So, in the space of just over 1 week, I'm awaiting my THIRD set of XM4 buds!  I don't have much anticipation these will be any better, but maybe third time lucky?  I really hope so because the sound from the XM4 is just so fantastic.  That's why I haven't given up on them.  My Galaxy Buds Pro are very close, but the warmth, instrument separation and high frequency reproduction just isn't at the Sony's level.  With the XM4, I truly feel like I'm in the room with the musicians.<br/>Can I still recommend the XM4?  To be honest, NO.  I wouldn't want anyone spending $250 to receive a sub-par set of supposedly premium earbuds.  If you want THE best sounding buds with top notch ANC, can afford this much money, and don't make calls in public, then go for it.<br/>Really, really disappointing from a major brand.<br/>.<br/>UPDATE I:<br/>.<br/>With ANC or Ambient mode on and no music playing, I noticed that when I banged my teeth together, I heard a dinging tone, primarily in the left bud.  A bit like an echo.  I even noticed it when the Google Assistant was talking.  There was a slight echo, which was the same monotone ding.  It sounds like a knock on a wooden wind chime tube.  With ANC/Ambient off, there's no sound.  So, it's the ANC system.  I've never heard that on any other ANC buds, even the XM3.  I had 24 hours on the buds.<br/>I did a chat with Sony Support and after all the usual questions, a bud reset, and a 3-minute hold, I was told the buds needed repair.  They were OK with my returning them to Amazon and getting a replacement.<br/>Those arrived today and guess what?  NO CHANGE!  I still hear the ding sound, though it's perhaps more prominent in the right bud as well now and perhaps less noticeable with the Assistant.<br/>It seems like this is a design defect, as others online report the same 'ringing', with replacements not helping.<br/>I guess I'll live with it.<br/>I was listening to The Living Daylights by A-Ha and realized it's a very difficult mix for buds to reproduce faithfully.  All my cheaper buds struggle with the high frequency details and particularly the bright guitar strums in the chorus, some better than others.  The XM4 sounds so realistic it's like you're hearing the instruments in your room.  The instrument separation and sound stage is outstanding.  I was surprised at the difference and now, my other buds really sound inferior.  I added that song to my Earbuds Test Track list!<br/><br/>ORIGINAL REVIEW:<br/>I’ve been looking for my ideal earbuds over the last few months and have not found them, until perhaps now, with the Sony WF-1000 XM4.  My primary criteria are comfort/fit, sound quality, ANC/Ambient performance, app customization and control, particularly volume, in this order.<br/>I am an audiophile only in the sense that I love listening to music (every genre you can come up with, but especially Symphonic Metal) and want to experience it as close to how the sound engineer intended, with perhaps a little warmth and bass added in if lacking in the original mix.  I use my buds for serious late-night listening, background music when working outside and for late-night TV, not wanting to disturb the sleeping family.  I use an android Moto G Power phone.  I am not an Apple fan at all!<br/>BACKGROUND INFORMATION:<br/>I believe I can give a fair review of these Sony’s, based on the fact that I have many, many hours of experience with the following buds…<br/>-<br/>Boltune BT-BH024<br/>SoundPEATS H1<br/>SoundPEATS Truengine 3 SE<br/>SoundPEATS T2<br/>SoundPEATS Trueair<br/>SoundPEATS Air 3<br/>Sennheiser Momentum TW2<br/>Edifier NB2 Pro<br/>Edifier Neobuds Pro<br/>Tribit Flybuds C1<br/>Soundcore Liberty 3 Pro<br/>Samsung Galaxy Buds Pro<br/>Sony WF-1000 XM3<br/>I also enjoy my CCA C10 wired IEM and Soundcore Q30 over-the-ear ‘phones.<br/>-<br/>I did like the Sony XM3 for its sound, controls, fit and app, but couldn’t get a reliable seal when even just out for a leisurely walk.  Generally, my issue has been maintaining that all-important seal during activity and the comfort over several hours of continuous use. I have determined that a stem-style bud doesn’t work in my ears and I hate buds touching my outer ear cartilage.  Also, my right ear is more sensitive to having a bud in it than the left, which never complains.  I also have very large ears and even the largest wings usually don’t fit!  I had finally settled on the Galaxy Buds Pro, coupled with Azla Crystal oval tips as being the design that best suited my criteria.  The only gripes were the highly sensitive touch controls, which I turned off and the right bud touching my outer ear, due to the bud’s body shape, and being a constant irritation!<br/>So, I was really expecting the Sony XM4’s to be a fit problem since a lot of reviewers complain about the size and foam tips.  I’ve tried foam tips and they can put a lot of pressure in the ear canal if too big.  Too small and they slide out.  It’s expensive the find that perfect size!  However, the ANC performance on the Sony XM4 was something I really wanted to experience, it supposedly being the best in the market, as of right now.  I decided to take the plunge and order them.<br/>-<br/>UNBOXING EXPERIENCE:  1/10<br/>I was disappointed, especially after a $248 outlay!<br/>Sony has gone to the extreme with their environmental concerns and destroyed that initial enjoyment of getting to the buds.  Having experienced the Soundcore Liberty 3 Pro and Neobuds Pro unboxing, which was a luxurious and high-quality affair, the plain paper/cardboard packaging was a real let down.  The whitish colored box looked dirty and used until I realized it was actually compressed paper material with a simple paper wrapping.  To get the box open, the paper wrapping has to be destroyed. So, once you have your buds, you are left with just a bland, unbranded container.  I like to keep all my product boxes.  While I understand the logic, Sony makes it look like they just went for the cheapest packaging they could.<br/>-<br/>INITIAL IMPRESSIONS – BUDS AND CASE:  7/10<br/>Again, there was a level of disappointment with these.<br/>The case has little embellishment, unlike the XM3.  Plain off-white plastic with a smooth upper lid surface and a fine shot-blasted, i.e., slightly textured rough feel to the rest.  Not reflective of a $248 purchase, based on all my other buds.  The lid feels firm at the hinge and snaps into the open position.  It does seem to be more fragile though, compared with the XM3 case.  The size is much smaller with the same form factor as the XM3.  Much more pocketable, but not the smallest on the market.<br/>The buds are similarly plain with a fine texture on the outside and smooth plastic inner surface, but for the unique brass-colored accent around the microphone.  They are indeed large at just over 3/4-inch diameter at the main round portion of the body.  I suspect the dark buds and case might look better.  The off-white exhibits the design’s plainness in a more in-your-face way.  This is very much in contrast to the Soundcore Liberty 3 Pro, which looks awesome in white, less so in black.<br/>These buds have an IPX4 rating which is something, compared with nothing on the XM3.  Not the best in the market, but acceptable.  I would expect better for the high price, especially since the Galaxy Buds Pro are IPX7!<br/>-<br/>FIT &amp; COMFORT:  9/10<br/>Fit and comfort is incredibly personal and you may experience a worse or even better fit than me.  I was pleasantly surprised with how the buds fit.  I tried the medium tips that came on the buds and they were just right.  The tip goes in reasonably deep into my ear canal and the body sits in my outer ear and filled it more than any other bud I’ve tried.  I can see how those with smaller ears will not have a comfortable and a tight fit.  However, the XM4 doesn’t actually touch my large outer ear, or if it does, it’s so slight I don’t notice it.  I admit the foam tip in my right ear is more noticeable as my right ear canal is slightly smaller than the left.  The small tip though didn’t seal fully.  I simply address that with a slight pull after insertion to slide the tip out just enough to reduce the pressure.  Within a few minutes, I just don’t feel the buds.<br/>I tried Spinfit tips (CP100, CP1025 and CP360) and they were perhaps more comfortable, but the ANC performance was reduced and the buds wobbled and hung down, resting against the bottom on my outer ear.  The stock tips were better in all respects and I can see why Sony chose them over silicone to hold these bulky buds.<br/>-<br/>SOUND QUALITY:  10/10 with some EQ adjustment<br/>I did like the sound profile of the XM3 and was expecting the XM4 to be very similar if not the same.  I was not disappointed this time!  As mentioned, I like a warm sound and punchy bass, but with a crisp treble.  I used my XM3 EQ settings as a baseline and adjusted from there.  Over time, my preference has changed and I now like a brighter sound than when I started this search.  When you experience the brightness, and perceived clarity, of the Liberty 3 Pro and Neobuds Pro, for example, you don’t want to go back to a soft sound.<br/>I have a large collection of Earbud Test Songs on Amazon Music and I listen to all of them to find the one EQ that meets my desired sound.<br/><br/>Check out my Earbud test tracks playlist on Amazon Music:<br/>https://music.amazon.com/user-playlists/6c1a03929ed947ab82cc33db24d7c001sune?ref=dm_sh_I4ZRJmh4tIHTtEUHGvvCYkvPi<br/><br/>I found the XM3 treble could sound a little artificial on some tracks, but not so on the XM4.  I really, really like the sound from them and with a little ClearBass boost, the bass is powerful and not overpowering or muddy.  I have noticed that the bass is slightly stronger with ANC on.  I use ANC all the time, so that is the mode I set my EQ for.<br/>-<br/>ANC:  9.5/10<br/>I have been really impressed with the Galaxy Buds Pro ANC performance, closely followed by the Liberty 3 Pro.  The Neobuds Pro are in that class also.  The Sony XM4 is slightly ahead, but not by much.  I actually think the electronics are just as effective on the others mentioned, but the foam tips are what give the XM4 the edge. The passive noise blocking is better.  Using Spinfit tips, which, being thin, typically let more noise in, the XM4 is worse at noise reduction than the others.  Also, the foam insertion depth and seal, if not deep and perfect, can really affect the ANC performance.  As with any earbud, the noise reduction is not as good as over-the-ear headphones.  Too much noise gets in around the ear. So, the XM4 wasn’t as impressive as I’d hoped.  My advice is not to spend this much money just for ANC. You can get the same performance for less with the other brands!<br/>Ambient mode on the XM4 is not super-hearing, like the Galaxy Buds Pro, but it works well.  I leave mine at the maximum level.  The ambient volume is adjustable.  I don’t use Speak-to-Chat as if I briefly tell my dogs to stop doing something, the buds switch to Ambient mode, which is annoying.  You can adjust the sensitivity, but then you might not activate it soon enough if you’re talking with someone.  It is definitely useful in an office environment on the high sensitivity setting.<br/>-<br/>TOUCH CONTROLS:  7/10<br/>Unlike SoundPEATS, where you get full control via the single, double, triple and touch/hold functions on both buds with all their models, the Sony XM4 limits your options, even though you get single, double, triple and touch/hold for just playback control.  You can change the left and right touch functions, but the options for each are Ambient Sound Control, Playback control, Volume control or None assigned.  You can choose one of each per bud.  I use playback control (including Google Assistant) on the left and volume control on the right.  I have to use the app on my phone for ANC/Ambient/Off control.<br/>The touch surfaces are well away from the edges of the buds.  So, you can adjust them as much as you want without any accidental touch operations.  Samsung, please note!<br/>The Galaxy Buds Pro will speak to me automatically for incoming notifications for apps you select, like text messages.  That’s my absolute favorite feature of any bud.  I never miss the wife’s texts when listening to music, which keeps me alive!  The Sony XM4 can do the same, but only after you touch and hold the left bud (only with Playback controls set) and then let go after the tone.  Google will then read your new notifications to you.  You can also just say “Hey Google, read my notifications”, which is nice, but you hear all notifications, not just from selected apps.  I have also used Google to adjust volume and switch ANC modes, though Google often annoyingly goes to an article about ANC and reads that to me!<br/>-<br/>BATTERY LIFE:  8/10<br/>I haven’t had a chance to do a more detailed check.  However, it seems like I can get between about the design 5 hours with 50% volume, ANC on, Custom EQ active, DSEE off and using LDAC codec.  That’s at least 25% better than the XM3 and better than the Liberty 3 Pro.  I’m OK with that amount of time as I usually need to go do things without buds by then.  The left bud loses more juice than the right due to the Google Assistant always listening on my left bud.  It is about a 7% difference over 3 hours.<br/>I believe the XM4 has a user-replaceable button battery like the XM3.  So if you’re mechanically-gifted like me, you’ll appreciate the ability to extend the life of these buds.  Sony also sells XM4 cases, individual buds, and tips!  Who else does that?  Awesome!<br/>-<br/>VOLUME, BLUETOOTH &amp; CODECS:  9/10<br/>The volume is plenty loud for me.  I rarely use more than 65% as I value my hearing!  I do have the ‘Absolute Volume’ disabled in Developer Options.  I set my phone’s BT volume to maximum and then use the buds to control the volume.  This increases the number of volume steps and negates the annoyingly large Android volume control steps that can mean one setting is too loud and the next step down is too quiet.  The media volume can be controlled almost as finely as a volume knob.<br/>I set the buds to highest sound quality over having a stronger BT connection.  So, the Sony Headphones app shows I am using the LDAC codec, not SBC or SBC and DSEE.  I turn DSEE off as I really don’t have much need for it as I listen to mostly high-quality files and that saves battery life.  On the XM3 app, you are warned that EQ + DSEE use more battery, but not on the XM4 app.  However, the DSEE still has to work harder in real-time to modulate the sound with a customized EQ setting, so the effect is the same on the XM4 as on XM3.<br/>I never really noticed a difference with LDAC on the XM3 or the Liberty 3 Pro, but strangely I do on the XM4.  A much better sound with respect to clarity and crispness.<br/>I use the Sony Media Center app as well.  That can automatically adjust the phone settings for the bitrate you want without having to go into Developer Options.  I set mine to the best possible.  That does affect the BT signal and I get some dropouts if the phone is in my back pocket or if I go more than a few feet from my phone.  I can set the bitrate to a lower level if I want to reduce the dropouts when outside working.  It’s a cool companion app and saves having to set the bitrate every time you connect the buds via the Developer Options and guarantees a higher quality sound all the time.<br/>-<br/>CALL QUALITY:  9/10  (SEE UPDATE II and III - 4/10)<br/>I haven’t had a chance to evaluate this in detail, but I heard and was heard very clearly with a natural sound in a quiet location when I did one call. The buds do go into Ambient mode.  While comfortable and quite acceptable, not as good as the Galaxy Buds Pro, where you almost feel like you have no buds plugging your ears.<br/>-<br/>APP:  10/10<br/>I won’t go into detail on the app.  You’ll be here another hour!  But I will say the app is as comprehensive as you’ll find in the market and is a customizer’s dream.  It’s not as colorful as and is more word-based than the Liberty 3 Pro app, which is also very comprehensive with other unique features.<br/>I personally have no need for the location/activity-based auto-adjustment of ANC/Ambient modes and recording of earbud usage while walking, running, etc. and I turn that off.  I use the buds mainly at home and prefer to make my own adjustments.  I also don’t need Sony knowing my whereabouts.  Google is more than enough.  It is nice to know though how much/long per day that you use the buds.  A feature which is always active.  I’m at 2 ¾ hours of listening so far since starting this review and my battery life is at 52%.<br/>-<br/>VALUE FOR MONEY:  7/10 (SEE UPDATE II and III - 2/10)<br/>If it weren’t for the fact that these have the best and most comfortable fit of all the buds I’ve tried, combined with a great sound and good ANC, I would NOT have kept these.  I’m wearing them right now and I do love them.  All genres sound fantastic.<br/>I really don’t think they are worth the extra $ over the Liberty 3 Pro, which is the best value of all buds at the current time. What you get for $170 is incredible, but you have to tame the overly boosted high frequencies with the EQ and vocals can still sound a little thin for my taste even then.  Their warranty support is superb.  I just couldn’t get a good fit with the wings.<br/>The Neobuds Pro at $130 are also superb, but stem-style.<br/>I bought the Galaxy Buds Pro for just $148 recently and they were my number one, but way too sensitive with inadvertent operation of the touch controls.<br/>Sony is now my number one as it pretty much meets all my earbud criteria.  Shame it cost $248!  Yes, the Sony app has more unique GPS features than any other brand, but I don’t use/need them.  The ANC is the best around, but not worth another $80 and more than the competition!  Sony does offer spare parts and that is worth a little extra for an extended life, though the technology is advancing at such a rate that these will be for sure outdated within their expected 2-year life.<br/>-<br/>CONCLUSION:  (SEE UPDATE III)<br/>So, would I recommend them?  I would recommend you try them but I can’t tell you you’ll love them.  One thing I learned this year is that there is no one perfect bud that does it all well.  Also, sound and fit are so personal that what I like, you could hate.  I even find what I like today can change next week with extended use.<br/>The Sony WF-1000 XM4 are absolutely a bud worthy of a try if you can afford them.</span>

<span>My experience with true wireless earbuds like this had previously been limited to a gifted pair of Skullcandy earbuds that retailed for less than 1/3 of what Sony asks for these.  Suffice it to say, those did not give me a good impression of this still somewhat new form factor for earbuds.  Their sound quality was atrocious (think sub-telephone quality audio, plus constant dropouts if the device they're connected to is anywhere but within eyesight.)  They had a tendency to activate themselves while in the charging case, draining both the earbud batteries, the case's battery, and also causing me to miss audible notifications because it cut the phone speaker off.  But despite the issues, the true wireless form factor was something that intrigued me, so I saved up and waited for these highly-rated Sony units to go on sale.  Now that I have them, are they worth the higher cost or are they just as troublesome as the cheapies?<br/><br/>Long story short: YES. These are head and shoulders better than those cheap trash buds, as they should be.  But do they justify the high cost compared to so many lesser brand competitors?  I think they do.  The sound quality is impressive (if not top of the line), and the noise cancelling works very well, especially if you can get a proper fit with one of the ear tip sets included with the purchase.<br/><br/>First, sound quality.  My personal "gold standard" reference headphones are my beloved Sennheiser HD 600, an open-backed mid-level home audio headphone.  They are a little low on bass but otherwise have superbly flat audio characteristics.  These Sony earbuds don't quite match the Sennheiser 'phones for overall quality, but they are far from poor performers.  They're a little bright and midrange-y for my tastes, but this isn't bad for most kinds of music or speech programming, in my opinion.  When they're snug in the ear canal they also offer a surprisingly good amount of bass.  They won't make your skull vibrate if you're a bass-head, but they can offer clean and punchy bass and pretty moderate volume levels, especially if you tweak the EQ in the available Headphones app for smartphones.  On my Pixel 6 Pro, they connect in "HD audio mode -- LDAC" for increased sound quality.  I hate that they don't seem to support aptX or aptX low latency, though, so these may not be suitable for watching videos on a TV.<br/><br/>Second, noise cancelling.  My main reference are a budget pair of Anker Soundcore Q20s, another over the ear headphone that's often available for $50 or less.  Despite their low cost, I think their noise cancelling is as good as the $400 Sony or Bose models that rate so highly.  Like, 90% that good for 1/8th cost.  So that's a pretty high bar.  These true wireless ear buds, sadly, don't quite work that well in this regard.  That said, they are far from poor performers in this regard.  They will reduce a LOT of background noise, especially when tightly fitted to your ears.  These are definitely geared more towards the typical "transportation noise" reduction, like the drone of a car or a plane's jet engine.  They work less well on higher-pitched sounds like the click-clack of a mechanical keyboard or chattering co-workers one cubicle over.  But, that's pretty typical of most noise cancelling headphones, regardless of style.<br/><br/>Battery life, so far, seems adequate for my light use needs.  I think I'm seeing about a 40% drop in earbud life after an hour's use, and that is topped back up by the case in less than half an hour of charging.  I've used them for several hours so far and the case's battery life is still over 80% so it should last several months of my sporadic use.<br/><br/>As for complains and issues, they are few.  The main gripe I have with these is how hard they are to remove from the case.  The case is slick, hard plastic, and fairly compact, and the ear buds are held in place by pretty strong magnets.  The ear buds are also slick plastic so it's hard for my ham hands to get a good grip on them.<br/><br/>Getting a good fit is a little hard for me, too.  Neither the small nor medium ear tips gave me a good seal, and the large ones are a little TOO big so they are tight even when they're not properly seated in my ears.  But, once I do shove them in (twisting them in place is what they recommend) they seal fairly good, at least in my left ear.  My right ear is still a little loose fitting, so it takes so fiddling to get it just right.<br/><br/>The touch sensitive pads on each ear bud are easy to accidentally tap while getting them fitted properly, too.  Once they're in place, though, the gentle tap controls work really well.<br/><br/>The one other issue I've experienced is that only one earbud has connected, so I got mono audio through both earbuds!  The only way to fix it was to put them back in the case, which I didn't have with me, so I had to do a listening session only hearing half the audio.  So far it's only happened once, but it was super annoying.<br/><br/>The Headphones app is necessary to unlock the full functionality of these earbuds. Not only can you manually pick the mode (noise cancelling on/off, or ambient mode on/off) you can also set the level of amplification used in the ambient mode.  There's an EQ with various presets and two custom slots for you to use as you want.  There's also a bass boost option and displays for battery life of each earbud and the case.  If you want to access some other features, like some silly social media type deal and a feature that automatically changes modes based on your usage patterns, you'll need a Sony account.  There's also some settings for 360° audio that require taking pictures of your ears and using specific apps like Spotify or Tidal, but again these are optional and not necessary to really get the most out of these earbuds.<br/><br/>Overall, they're a pretty good set of earbuds, and at least in my opinion, worth the cost when they go on sale.  If you try them, be sure to try all three sets of ear tip cushions and use the Headphone app's test tool, it will help you find which ones will work best.</span>

<span>I have to say that until about a week ago, I owned a well-known competing brand of earbuds. (Let’s just call it brand J.) But my dog found the right-side bud laying on the carpet and dismantled it. Without the right-side bud, the left one is useless. Brand J makes great buds, but I heard the Sony WF-1000XM4 buds had better sound quality. So, I bought a pair of Sony buds, and I’m glad I did.<br/><br/>The Sony buds come with three sizes of replacement tips; however, I ordered rubber replacement tips from a third-party vendor because the originals are made of foam, which in my experience is more difficult to clean and has to be replaced too frequently.<br/><br/>I noticed right away that the bluetooth reception range on the Sony buds is shorter than on brand J. This is important to me at home when I listen to podcasts and audio books. With brand J, I can leave the phone in my room and go out to the kitchen or the living room without losing the signal. But with the Sony buds, I have to carry the phone with me all the time in order to keep the signal from dropping out. Even line-of-sight outdoors, the difference in reception distance is marked. I’ve learned simply to never walk away from my phone when I’m connected, and that resolves the issue. For me, it’s worth the trouble because of Sony’s superior sound quality.<br/><br/>Sony has an app for the phone that allows for EQ customization as well as access to a number of convenience features. My favorite is the feature that allows me to designate when and where the buds will automatically switch between Noise Cancelling and Ambient Sound. For example, I know that when I’m out walking the dog I want to be able to hear all the street noises around me. Therefore, because I set it that way, when the phone senses I’m moving it switches to Ambient Sound. I can also adjust settings instructing the buds to change sound dynamics when I arrive at specific locations.<br/><br/>There is one issue that really annoys me. First, I don’t normally take the bud charger along when I do errands around town. Most of the time I can listen to media through my buds then seamlessly transition to the car’s audio player. And when I get out of the car to go into a store, the buds usually connect to the phone again within a few seconds after putting them back in my ears. But every now and then the buds fail to connect when I turn off the car engine. In that case, I have to  go through the steps of placing them back in the charger then immediately taking them out and putting them in my ears. If I don’t have the charger with me, I’m required to shut off power to the buds, plus turn off blue tooth before starting from scratch again. Maybe I’ll just make it a habit to carry my charger whenever I go for a drive. The Sony charger is slightly larger than Brand J’s charger, but carrying them around is still doable.<br/><br/>The Sony buds are larger and heavier than brand J buds as well, but they feel just as comfortable in my ears. And if I want to change to a different mode on the buds, all I have to do is tap. With brand J, I had to press on the buds which pushed them deeper into my ear.<br/><br/>I also like the Sony voice that speaks when I change modes. It’s nice and pleasant, and sounds like I’m listening to a National Public Radio broadcaster. The brand J voice sounds like someone talking to me on a Ham radio set.<br/><br/>You can’t go wrong with these Sony buds. They were at the top end of my earbud budget, but they were certainly worth the money. And if my dog should some day eat one of my Sony buds, the other one will continue to work independently.</span>

<span>I am a Huge Techics Fan and Technics owner of Audio Equipment/Speakers for many years. I have about over 20 of the BEST True Wireless Earbuds in my Audio Collection, I listen to a lot of Music as a Hobby. I want to say first, that I did not want to write this Review because I am too busy to Write any Reviews. But after listening and trying the Technics AZ70 True Wireless Earbuds out for 2 days, I was amazed, happy and I was blown away. These Technics AZ70 True Wireless Earbuds do indeed sound GOOD!!  Sound quality is Excellent as expected. Yes, and Earbuds come with 5 Sets of Silicone Eartips inside of the Box. But the thing is, is that Technics Silicone Earbuds are NOT made for Bass Music, by using just Silicone Eartips. Technics would have included a Pair of Foam Earbud Tips! The Technics AZ70 True Wireless Earbuds do have some Bass, but Bass is lacking with the Silicon Earbud Tips that are included inside of the Box.<br/><br/>As an Expert Audiophile person, I can tell that the Silicone Earbud Tips that are included in the Box do NOT produce the Bass well for all songs!!!  The Silicone Earbud Tips are holding the Earbuds back from performance.  On the 1st Day of buying the Technics Earbuds and trying them out the 1st day, I was NOT happy with the Bass of the Earbuds, and I was thinking about 1st Returning the Technics Earbuds to Amazon.  But luckily I decided to give Technics Earbuds a Second TRY on the second day. And that is when I was BLOWN away by the REAL Music Quality of Technics True Wireless Earbuds. On the 2nd Day of TRYING the Earbuds I decided to try using "Foam EarTips", and that is when all of the BASS came a LIVE inside of the Technics True Wireless Earbuds. Oh My God!! I could NOT believe the Improved Sound Quality that Happened from just trying some "GOOD Foam Eartips". I think Technics Manufactures forgot to ADD Foam Eartips to the Technics True Wireless Package Box, it may have just been an over sight, that they missed.

These Technics AZ70 True Wireless Earbuds are worth the money if you prioritize Audio and build quality over everything else. For a wireless experience, these Technics did a great job in bringing much better Music Sound and ANC over many other True Wireless Earbuds. There’s a lot more emphasis on the mids and highs, creating a Brighter sound Signature overall. The Midrange, this is where the Technics really Shines. Shimmering, clear, and clean. Not too thin sounding, not too thick, but just right. Surprising amounts of depth, and a great subtlety of detail that competes with even the other high-end true wireless models.<br/><br/>Music sound leans towards a Good upper-mid emphasis, but the feeling while listening is really "Well Balanced". The delicacy up in this range makes the Technics a formidable choice for classical, jazz, folk, and other genres of music that other true wireless earbuds usually leaves behind. Maybe it’s that Digital Sound Processor (DSP) at work, but the ultra-highs actually have some resolution here. I’ll be straight up: the Technics sounds better than any other true wireless earbuds in the $200 price range. The Technics brings a lot more to the High-End Audio listening than I was expecting. I am very pleased with everything. These Technics earbuds are $199.99 cheaper in price, and Technics Earbuds have a much Better high end and midrange than the other True Wireless Earbuds. The Music in these Technics True Wireless Earbuds sound so "GOOD", that even if you take the Technics True Wireless Earbuds out of your ears and you place Technics Earbuds on a Desk/Table 2 Feet away from you with the Technics True Wireless Earbuds Volume at only 50%, you can still hear the exact Words of the Song that is playing inside of the Technics Earbuds. That is how Clear the Audio is. It sounds like 2 giant Technics Speakers playing.<br/><br/>Foam Eartips provide Big Soundstage and enormous ability to deliver the Good thumping Bass. The Technics AZ70 True Wireless Earbuds Sound quality is Excellent for a Bluetooth True Wireless Earbuds with Active Noise Cancelling, the True Wireless Earbuds they provide a push of tight Lows with Bass and a Nice warm midrange that goes well with any type of Music. I would say simply the sound is magnificent for Technics AZ70 True Wireless Earbuds price. The Bass response is Excellent and the soundstage is unmatched at the price. Mids are good and lush warm and rich which makes male and female vocals a Delight and the Smooth Treble means that you will never suffer from fatigue or any sibilance. Overall, the Sound quality is well Balanced and neutral and Technics AZ70 True Wireless Earbuds are technically very good.<br/><br/>By using Foam Eartips the Technics AZ70 True Wireless Earbuds sound and Audio Quality is strong with Big Bass and a full Deep Midrange. Highs are rolled off and exceptionally Nice &amp; Smooth. I just get blown away by how realistic these things sound by using the Foam Earbuds Tips. I know you probably wondering what am I talking about? Well, I did a BASS Song Test with the Song called "Sunrise by Simply Red". In that Song, there is a lot of Bass. If you listen to that Song with the included Medium or Large Silicone Eartips, you will hear how Bad, or Tinny the BASS sounds in the Technics Earbuds. But if you try again, and you use Foam Eartips and listen to the same Song called "Sunrise by Simply Red", you will then hear how much 10x's Better and more Alive the Bass sounds in Music using Foam Eartips. If you listen to that song for the whole 3 minutes, it will literally sound like you are at a Music Concert, music is Crystal Clear, when using Foam Eartips on the Technics Earbuds. When you use Foam Eartips you will hear the Immediate Difference, or you will hear the immediate Sound Improvement when listening to any type of Music. I am Serious. The Technics AZ70 True Wireless Earbuds are designed to deliver a Dynamic Feeling. When listening to Music using the Foam Eartips, it then sounds like the Technics Sound Music is reaching down into your Soul.<br/><br/>You can feel the Music inside of you, and the Technics Music will connect with you Incredibly from using Foam Eartips. I would say by using any of the Foam Tips that I have mentioned, The Technics AZ70 True Wireless Earbuds create some of the Most Immersive and Realistic Hi-Fi Sound possible. "If you use Foam Earbuds Tips, the Music will then sound like you are inside of a Music Recording Studio." Try it. I am serious. If you buy these Technics True Wireless Earbuds, do yourself a Favor and purchase or invest in some Good $6.99 or $8.99 Amazon.com Foam Eartips like I did, and you will hear the "Improved Sound Quality" that I am talking about. I think the ALXCD Foam Eartips for Jabra Elite 65t Headphone, S/M/L 3 Size Memory Foam Ear Tips are the Best. From using Good Foam Earbud Tips, I have found that the Technics EAH-AZ70W True Wireless Earbuds really deliver Rich, Expansive Sound with Smooth, Detailed Highs and nice, tight, articulate Bass to "Hear ANY Music as it was intended."<br/><br/>I have found out that the Technics EAH-AZ70W True Wireless Earbuds really have Audiophile-Grade Sound! I hope the Technics Engineers, Technics Makers or Technics Designers of these Technics Earbuds Read this Review and People try TESTING out their Technics True Wireless Earbuds with some "GOOD Foam Earbuds Tips" as I mentioned, and they too will see &amp; hear exactly how much Better the Technics True Wireless Earbuds Really Sound. The Key to the Absolutely #1 BEST Sounding Earbuds in the entire World is by using Foam Earbuds Tips on the Technics True Wireless Earbuds. "I am Serious". The Foam Earbuds Tips that I have mentioned above make a HUGE Audio Improvement to the Technics AZ70 True Wireless Earbuds. I would say that Technics AZ70 True Wireless Earbuds are the Best sounding Earphones, or BEST True Wireless Earbuds that I have ever tested.  I Highly Recommend them.</span>

<span>Primarily paired with an iPhone 12 Pro Max. I was reasonably satisfied with the overall sound quality initially. The app is a little slow to recognize the buds at times, but you don't really need to use the app much outside of the first use and subsequent firmware updates. The app does allow for some tuning of a basic EQ, which works reasonably well.<br/><br/>As a call headset, these are pretty good. Most people I've asked about whether or not they could hear me said they couldn't tell I was using ear buds. In one case, though, the neighbor was using a gas powered yard trimmer that wasn't super loud from my vantage point, but these picked up that sound and amplified it for some reason.<br/><br/>Now to upset all my fellow Apple users. Apple uses  AAC for the audio streaming. I also have a Pixel phone that I use occasionally. The bluetooth on that phone  (A2DP, I think) is far superior to the iPhone and the sound is jaw dropping in comparison to the Apple device.<br/><br/>If you're only planning on using these with an iPhone, you could probably be happy with some $40 buds.<br/><br/>Finally, these came with 5 different sizes of silicone tips. None of them are super secure in my ear canals, but I've always had trouble with fit. I worry a bit about losing one or both, but have managed to not do so in the first few months of ownership.</span>

<span>There's a lot to like about these buds: Great sound, great noise cancellation, competitive set of features for the price, cool Technics design/pedigree.<br/><br/>In the so-so column: They're on the bulkier side (but by design). They slid a bit out of my ears with the repetitive motion of walking down a flight of steps (but stayed in place). Battery life is on the average/low end (about 5.75 hours on a single charge for me, with active noise canceling turned off). They're fiddly to get out of the case. But none of these were deal-breakers for me.<br/><br/>The touch controls were the deal-breaker. They're easy enough to learn, if not super-logical--but responsive to a fault. Trying to nail down the difference between a tap and a touch, for example, or a double-tap and triple-tap is tough--and just frustrating after a while.  Any minor adjustment of/slight contact with the buds can (will) trigger some unwanted action. The first time this happened to me (as I was seating them in my ear, for f's sake) the buds activated my phone's voice control, which picked up some background TV noise, which the phone registered as a command to dial somebody I haven't spoken to for 6 years--all in the span of about 2 seconds. The next morning, the same thing happened. Both of these awkward moments were triggered by a single touch of the buds--so I just returned them.<br/><br/>Is this normal for capacitive touch controls, especially on earbuds? Maybe. But this was pretty extreme. If Panasonic/Technics allowed users to program their own controls, it might help. Or just added a *little* latency. As it stands, the touch controls just interfere with the listening experience.</span>

<span>These are the best sounding TWS earbuds I have ever listened to. Period. The best way I can describe them is "effortless and delicate"; they are very well balanced and to my ears, follow the Harman target quite closely with a slight emphasis on the treble.<br/><br/>Don't let the AAC codec fool you, these buds are highly resolving. I almost cannot believe they are Bluetooth and not wired. There is no weird sibilance and these hold up under busy tracks.<br/><br/>The ANC is amazing and bad at the same time. Let me explain; the ANC is very very good, it's almost uncanny actually.<br/><br/>But, the ANC has a fatal flaw, and it is the sole cause on why I'm returning them (I bought them with ANC as priority). The problem is in a somewhat quiet environments, the ANC processes an annoying hiss that frustrates me to no end. I am very sensitive to sound so this might not bug you, but it bugs me. However, if you use ANC in actual noisy environments, then it works very well. The hiss might be a firmware issue, no idea, but I don't buy things hoping for a firmware fix. You shouldn't either.<br/><br/>Personally, I like to turn on ANC and listen to no music while I study, and the hiss bothers me too much.<br/><br/>But for most of you, these are amazing. These are worth the price tag just for the audio quality alone. Technics is back folks.</span>

<div class="slideshow-container">
<blockquote><em><div class="a-row a-spacing-small review-data"><span class="a-size-base review-text review-text-content" data-hook="review-body">
<span>Let's get this out of the way: These are not your all-purpose earbuds. I have TMJ issues (jaw joint) that have made it effectively impossible to wear normal headphones while using my computer - like I had for years - without pain, so I use these instead. Normal earbuds closing off the ears for hours at a time is uncomfortable and not great for the ears. My point is, if you do not have a specific reason to need this design, you should not buy them. They are a compromise compared to regular true wireless earbuds costing half as much. With that said, for their intended purpose, these work pretty well.<br/><br/>AUDIO:<br/>Sound quality is excellent, detailed and well-balanced (as long as they're not pushed too hard... see below on volume). You will not get a lot of bass. You can hear the bass tones, especially if you add some boost, so the dynamic range isn't lost - but it's not going to thump in your ears. I did find that enabling bass boost (in Windows for my use case, or in the phone app for phone use) helped the overall sound balance. Music sounds slightly hollow to my ears without it.<br/><br/>I see the popular review about volume - I have not experienced this in my quiet apartment use case. They have plenty of volume even though Windows bass boost cuts the overall volume down. I keep them at 50-60% volume on my computer, and I tested them on my phone (Pixel 6 Pro, for what it's worth) and settled on roughly the same volume. 100% volume is uncomfortably loud, and also noticeably affects quality (at least on PC, I can't recall if it was the same on the phone). If you are trying to use these in a particularly loud environment, they might not work well.<br/><br/>BLUETOOTH:<br/>I have had no issues with connection quality within a short range (i.e. typical usage range). However, if I walk to my bathroom on the other side of my tiny 1-bed apartment, which places the utility closet (and thus quite a bit of metal) between me and the computer, the connection starts dropping in and out. I have cheaper earbuds that are able to maintain a connection there. Not a big deal, and most people use earbuds with their phone which is on their person, so this is pretty unique to me.<br/><br/>They do not have multi-point. While I am not the type of person to field many phone calls, I can see this being annoying for someone who does if they're using them the way I am, on the computer. Teleworkers in particular might consider this a deal-breaker if they take a lot of work calls. As it is, you'd have to pop one earbud out and answer the phone normally, or use speakerphone, rather than the convenience of the earbuds providing both sound from the computer and calls from the phone.<br/><br/>These do not support LDAC. With the audio limitations inherent to this design, I suspect it simply wasn't worth enabling - LDAC uses more power.<br/><br/>BATTERY:<br/>Speaking of power, the battery life on these is... not great, not terrible. To be fair, Sony isn't hiding anything here - look at the battery life ratings between their true wireless options and it is obvious that these are not designed to have a particularly long life. I haven't precisely measured, but I would guess that they are true to their 5+ hour rating.<br/><br/>I do wish they lasted longer, but it's not the end of the world. The fast-charge feature makes it so that occasionally taking a short break and sticking them back in their case is sufficient to keep them going effectively indefinitely. If your use case involves really long periods of uninterrupted use, these might not be your jam.<br/><br/>FIT / COMFORT:<br/>The big one. Fitting these properly is EXTREMELY important. I cannot overstate how much proper fit matters for both sound quality and comfort. Until you learn how to fit them, you cannot just pop them in and go, like traditional earbuds. They will sound bad, be horribly uncomfortable, and/or fall out.<br/><br/>I suspect reviews related to extremely poor sound quality (tinniness), falling out, etc., are mostly related to not taking the time to find the correct position and fit ring, minus the rare exceptions for certain people's ears just not working with these. Play around with them, try out different size fit rings, adjust the positioning to find that sweet spot where they're comfortable and the sound isn't tinny. This wasn't something I succeeded in doing on the first day I had them. It took a few days for me to figure it out. But now that I've learned, I *can* just pop them right in (mostly... maybe a tiny bit of fiddling). They are comfortable enough for me to wear for several hours, but I wouldn't say they entirely disappear.<br/><br/>FEATURES:<br/>I do not use the few music apps that support their 360 audio, nor do I use them for phone calls, nor do I use them where I would need the speak-to-chat pausing or adaptive volume, so I can't speak to any of those features. They're all there though!<br/><br/>The phone app has an equalizer, it does equalizer things. As mentioned in the audio quality section, it has a separate bass boost, which I recommend playing around with if you're using them with your phone.<br/><br/>There are only two tap functions (double tap and triple tap), which honestly sucks. I don't understand why so many otherwise competent earbud designers refuse to offer more functions. Since I use these with the computer, I rarely need to actually use the tap functions, so it doesn't really matter in my use case. It probably will matter for most people, though.<br/><br/>The Wide Area Tap feature is theoretically very cool and responds to taps well. That might sound great, but the problem is that it also false triggers constantly for me. Eating something? Okay, track skipped. Several tracks, actually, because you didn't stop eating. Yawned? Got it, you want to pause your music. I went to the trouble of installing the app and temporarily connecting them to my phone *just* to turn the feature off. It was driving me nuts.<br/><br/>VERDICT:<br/>See the title. These are compromised by design, but the design exists to accomplish a very specific goal, opening up the ear. If you need that, you should give these a try. If you don't, there is no reason to buy these.</span>

<span>I've been looking for open-fit earbuds for so long, that when I first saw these LinkBuds I knew they were for me. They might not be for you, though. Regardless, I think everyone should own a pair of these as they're super functional.<br/><br/>USE CASE:<br/>I really don't like the earbuds that cram into your ear canal, so after owning the Samsung Galaxy Buds I knew my next pair must be open-fit, however, the ones that are on the market have so many downsides. I even considered buying the AirPods, but as an Android user, that would be deranged (because of codec compatibility you'd be getting poor performance). The LinkBuds don't. They check all my boxes: comfortable, portable, good sound and call quality. I love that I can hear my music or podcast and still hear the outside world. I use them all the time when I'm at the office, going around doing errands, and even in the house, and sometimes I don't even notice I'm wearing them, they have a light yet secure fit.<br/><br/>PROS:<br/>Sound quality. Yes, bass is  little lacking, but in exchange you get an open, clear soundstage, great highs and mids, and if you get Sony's app you can crank the bass boost and get good bass levels.<br/>Functionality. You can hear your music, podcast or video and still hear everything around you clearly. This is most useful in an office space, where you need to be able to hear the people around you, or when walking, running, or working out so you can be aware of your surroundings.<br/>Innovation. Sony is pioneer coming out with fresh ideas when everyone else is doing the same thing, so if you're into tech, you should be happy by owning a quality product that is so different from everything else out there. I'm excited to see what Sony does on future iterations of this product, which hopefully will improve on some of the downsides.<br/><br/>CONS:<br/>Battery life. One of the major flaws. Don't get me wrong, the battery life is decent, lasting up to 6 hours for me on a single charge (plus 3 more charges from the case), but if these buds are meant to be worn all day one would think that they should last longer, perhaps closer to 8 hours.<br/>Lack of wireless charging. I love the practicality of wireless charging, and honestly at this price point they should include it. My guess is they wanted to keep the case as small possible, but I'd gladly trade it for a slightly bigger case that supports wireless charging.<br/>No high-res codec. Again, at tis price point they should include support for Sony's high-res codec LDAC. In any case the sound is pretty good with SBS or AAC codec.<br/><br/>As I said in the beginning, I think everyone should own a pair of these LinkBuds, since they are a super practical and innovative piece of technology.</span>

<span>If I had to give someone a quick down and dirty written review of these headphones I think this would be it. I have been looking for earbuds like these for a while. I have a small ear canal so using earbuds that fit into my ear Canals comfortably is hard for me. The last earbuds that were every day drivers for me were the Samsung galaxy buds live and those were my favorite because they stayed in my ear and stayed stable regardless of the activity. These do the same thing also, they stay inside my ears regardless of what I'm doing and the fit is somewhat comfortable for long periods of wear they were mort comfortable before I switched to a large wing tip but they feel more secure now. These do not have noise canceling but I think if your looking for ear buds like that then these are not the earbuds for you. If you're getting them so you can hear the environments true outside sounds due to the open hole design its perfect at blending the two, outside sounds and inside sounds. I guess the volume at which you listen to media also determines how much of the outside you hear but don't get it twisted no matter how loud the music is you will still hear extremely loud and important things such as car horns sirens etc. If that is the kind of environment that you live or won't to operate these in then they are perfect. I have use a lot of headphones and earbuds that have accompanied software and I have to say that these have some of the best software that I have used. The companion Sony headphone app has all the useful feature like and EQ and more. It also has some features that I haven't seen before like like tap touch control but their different. Instead of taping the earbud you tap your jaw/temple area to active controls such as play pause etc which is a nice feature. Comes in handy when you're wearing a beanie or hat that covers your ears. They also have one great feature that I have never seen or used on earbuds before...maybe it a sony thing but its cool. The Earbuds will play and pause whatever you listening to when they detect you speaking to someone which is a great feature for me and maybe some of you. It take out that step of having to tap the earbuds or using your watch or phone to stop the music to speak with someone. I love this feature when I'm out grocery shopping and run into these random conversation scenarios. This feature can also be somewhat bothersome when you're into your music and you jamming out and you decide to sing to the song and the music stops. I guess it's not that much or a problem for me though because I just turn the feature on and off when I don't want to or want to use it. Something else that I want to touch on is the case. This is usually where the best headphone manufactures fall short. The case build will be crappy or built without other things in mine. One big thing that was a problem with my earbuds live was the case. If I dropped the case with the earbuds in it they would go flying out of the case when it hit the ground. The case for these is small compact with great reserve charging battery power. The case snaps closed and the ear buds  snap into the case through magnets and clips and the are super secure in my opinion, just incase you drop them. The battery life is great on them also I use them for the past couple of days for long periods of time and I was not able to kill them in a single listen. The case battery life is less than usual but its it still comparable to other earbuds on the markets. You can pair the earbuds with devices with the bottom button on the case without the app which is good and the battery indicator light is basic and strait foward for as charging and and battery usage and you can see it regardless of if the case is opened or closed. These are usually things that the other manufactures mess up. Sound quality is fantastic for open design headphones but not as good as a sealed design. All and all these are my new favorite everyday driver headphones. This review pertains to the points that are import to me. I purchased them at the launch price and I think they are worth it. Get these if they are similar to what you prefer if they get a little cheaper or they go on sale, its a no brainer.</span>

<span>Give them a chance, and use an equalizer.<br/><br/>Let me start by saying that most reviews, even "professional" ones, underestimate the Bass, and audio quality of these ear-buds.<br/><br/>First of all, the volume is limited to about half.  I don't know the decibels, but I was at first disappointed that they didn't get very loud.  However, I switched to my PowerAmp equalizer, and turned up the Pre-Amp, this boosts the overall volume of the audio before it is equalized, and then played out the speakers.  +15 Decibels, and it was loud enough to hurt my ears, and surprise, it sounded good, and clear.  It turns out, the hardware is capable of high volume, but the software limits it for some reason.  Even the Bass was impressive.  Skrillex, The Glitch Mob, Panda Eyes, game music, everything sounded full, deep, and detailed.  I even noticed details I never noticed before.<br/><br/>Let me be more clear.  I appreciate audio fidelity.  I can't say I'm a full fledged audiofile, but I've researched for years into encoding, bit rates, equalizers, and hardware specks.  That being said, yes, bass is limited by the size of the drivers.  Bigger speakers, means heavier bass, and the more bass, the more you feel it in your bones.  That being said, no ear-buds can ever give you that drum beat that you feel in your chest.  You can hear it, but you won't physically feel it from any small speakers.  You need a full size headset for that, like on-ear, or over-ear headphones.  This is just physics, the bass you feel, is a result of the volume of air being pushed by the speaker.<br/><br/>That being said, for ear-buds, the bass is impressive.  If you want something tiny, that let's you enjoy your music, these won't disappoint, as long as you actually take advantage of them with an equalize.  What I like about Sony, is they tend to have a balanced sound, which is a perfect starting point to bring out the best of any music.  You tune it to suit your taste.  Even the app for the buds has a built-in equalizer, it's intended by design to tune to your preference, so don't expect to have the best audio right out of the box.<br/><br/>These got so loud, I couldn't hear myself talk.  I just absolutely love these.  I had to set the Pre-Amp to 10db, and turn the volume down, cause they just get too loud, even if it does sound good.  Remember, protect your ears.  At relatively normal volume, you hear everything around you, as if you don't even have ear-buds on.  If you get comfortable, you could forget they're even there.<br/><br/>I do find the fitting a little difficult.  Maybe it's just my ear shape, or that I have nails.  It's hard to get the tips in place, and the hard plastic body does hurt my ears.  Maybe my ears will get used to it, honestly, I hope they do.  The sound, and fact that I can hear traffic on my bike makes it worth the pain.  I hope Sony improves on this with a more comfortable design.  Still, comfort is a personal thing, some people will have no issue.<br/><br/>Battery life is great, take a break from them every now and then, and since the case charges them, I'm never close to them dying on me.  I'm honestly not even concerned about battery life.<br/><br/>I have issues with the sensors activating, or registering touches I wasn't intending.  Sometimes Google assistant seems to start on its own, or my hood will affect it.  Worse case scenario, you can turn all these smart features off, so it's not a deal breaker.<br/><br/>Calls work well.<br/><br/>My final word, give them more credit than the articles you read, and use an equalizer to tune them.  I recommend PowerAmp equalizer, it works for Spotify, YouTube, even games, it processes all the audio from your phone before its sent to the speakers.  It brings out the full potential of these tiny little ear bugs.  Give them the full chance, they will impress you.<br/><br/>If you're looking for "Noise Canceling", "ANC", let me remind you, these are literally designed on purpose to be the exact opposite of that.  These are for the people who want their music, and at the same time hear what's around them.  These ear-buds are one of a kind, and fill a gap in a market dominated by shutting everything else out.  These are special, because they are different, so understand that, and ignore the people who say "but they don't have noise canceling", like that's a bad thing.  I could write a longer rant, but won't.  Just keep in mind what these are designed for, and don't directly compare them to anything else.  These are unique, and there is no comparison.</span>

<span>Review for WYZE Earbuds Pro, 40 dB Active Noise Cancelling Wireless Earbuds<br/><br/>I'm generally a Wyze fan.  I have a few of their cameras and while I think they could be a bit more user-friendly for novices, their prices are amazing, as is the quality.  When they started hyping these, I was looking forward to trying them.  I've never done wireless earbuds before, and I've never done noise cancelling either.  And Wyze seemed REALLY proud of these so I decided these would be my introduction to wireless and noise cancelling.  And.. do they live up to the hype?  I honestly don't know.  Maybe it's just me?<br/><br/>The fit is nice and comfortable.  They're lightweight and generally stay put, though I wouldn't recommend blowing leaves while wearing them - as I did and then had to search for one of them in a pile of leaves.  They pretty much look like any wireless earbuds you see, so there's nothing especially unique or amazing there.  Between the earbuds and their storage case, the battery life is on the higher end of adequate.  So, for the basics they're a reasonably decent version of what they want to be.<br/><br/>Sound quality is... weird.  When I have them on with the noise reduction enabled, it's really nice.  Very full sound, not too wimpy with the volume (I assume noise cancellation helps with that).  Again on the higher end of adequate for the lows without muddying up the rest, and not too tinny on the highs.  Think Bose - kind of a similar sound.  A pleasant listen that doesn't leave me wishing I had better earbuds, so there's that.  BUT, turn the noise cancellation off and it's a totally different story.  Even in the quietest of rooms they sound horrible.  Small and quiet and very tinny, with no depth at all.  No matter what I do with EQ and levels and whatnot, they are among the absolute worst earbuds I've ever heard.  Only slightly better than listening to someone else's earbuds when they're in that person's ears.  They're just god-awful.  Turn the noise cancellation back on and it's like magic.  Suddenly everything's wonderful again.  It makes no sense, and my ears can't detect there really being any less noise when the environment IS noisy compared to the old wired non-noise-cancelling earbuds I have and love (except for the wire).  And I don't discount the fact that this is new to me so I might be doing something wrong.  I've messed with all the settings I could find, and these are my results.<br/><br/>Requiring the phone app to use them is kind of ridiculous too, though without the phone app I wouldn't be able to turn the noise cancelling on and these would have been the single worst purchase I've ever made.  As it is, I actually do love these despite everything I've written.  But since they're the only wireless noise-cancelling earbuds I've tried I suspect I'd be happier with some other brand as long as the sound quality was there.  For now I really only use these while doing yardwork or doing noisy projects so I'm not needing to rush out and get better ones.  These will do, I guess.</span>

<span>Unpacked it added it to the wyze app on iphone upgraded the firmware connecting to the phone no problem. Connected to the mac no problem but there is no way I can get the sound in the headsets. Once I managed to get the sound into the headset from the mac by some mirracle (no idea how) and it has sounded very good. I only have it for a day therefore I cannot tell anything about the battery life.  Very confortable however not a big fan of how the buds are placed into the case but that's just a personal preference.</span>

<span>I liked these pretty much, fit was comfy,  but, you can not get the volume up very high and every now and again you want to blast something. The app is OK, nothing great. It says bass boost, but the tech says that doesn't work (so why have it on the app), they only go to 11db of loudness That's just stupid. I couldn't get the bass response to do much either. Plenty of treble if that's your thing, not mine. I sent them back.</span>

<span>Overall, I like these earbuds a lot, but the touch sensors are too sensitive for me. They have good sound, and I love that they come with multiple sizes so you can get a perfect fit. But every time I adjust them, they pause the sound. Sometimes even my hair will activate the sensor, which is extremely annoying.</span>

<span>So these ear buds worked fairly well while they lasted. Had good noise reduction. Each ear worked independently. Ambient sound was ok. The battery life was slightly shorter than advertised. So the return window closed on October 9th, which was 30 days after purchase. On today October 22, I walked in the house, kissed my wife and the left bud falls out of my ear. The bud breaks open and is now useless. Don’t think I’ll purchase these again. I have had several different ear buds that i have paid much less for and this is the first one to break after simply falling out my ear.  So I guess I’ll be on the look out for something new.</span>

<span>Sound quality is ok when connected to a phone, but microphone is unusable when connected to a laptop. Sound quality is just awful in that case. The earbuds also disconnect from Bluetooth constantly. I tend to use them 30ish minutes at a stretch and it’s rare for them not to disconnect at least once.

<span>Been using the rz-s500 for a half a year now and it's a mixed bag. I can only recommend it for those needing a deep seal due to the individual's ear canal shape. If not, there are better options elsewhere.<br/><br/>Pro:<br/>-Fit is easier due to its tubular shape, at least for my ears. The Sony ANC earbuds may have better electronic ANC but their shape prevented me from inserting the buds deep enough to create a good seal. Due to my ear canal shape, I have to place buds deeper in my ear to get a good seal, which these provide.<br/><br/>Neutral<br/>-sound quality is ok. It's not very dynamic. Bass will be lacking if you really like the low range. There's no staging, though you really shouldn't be expecting it here. You won't be disappointed by the sound, but it won't impress either.<br/>-software is usable and straightforward, and comes with the expected settings for a product like this. But you must give it location permission for it to work even if you don't want to use the "find if lost" function. You can set all the setting to what you like, including turning off the ongoing blue led, and then uninstall the software. The settings will stay saved on the device. I have seen two updates since I bought it, so at least they are maintaining it (for now).<br/>-touch controls work, but it takes a little practice.<br/><br/>Cons:<br/>-the charging case will continually charge the buds even if the buds are fully charged. This means your charging case will drain itself in a few days even if you never use the buds. This also means you're going to wear out the lifespan of both the batteries in the case and buds since discharging to zero (for the case) and continually charging a full battery (for the buds) stresses the batteries. I've resorted to storing the buds in the wrong sides of the case to avoid this, but that means the lid won't fully close.<br/>-tends to fall out more easily with jarring exercises like running. Really could have used some wings to help keep them in place.<br/>-hinge on the charging case doesn't appear meaty enough and I have concerns with how it'll hold up with any kind of abuse like an accidental drop.<br/>-no support for any version of aptx and so on android devices, there is a noticeable but minor delay in audio which creates sync issues when watching video</span>

<span>I've had a pair of these in regular use for 16 months. They're going strong in every way... battery life, sound quality, durability. I use them a lot while exercising and they significantly block treadmill and fan bike noise, so I at most bump the volume up just one notch or not at all. Fit is comfortable and stays in my ears even while exercising.<br/><br/>Sound is great. It's got full bass without being boomy. Mids and highs are articulate and balanced. Turning on ANC warms and fills out the spectrum nicely. I listen to a lot of dance, EDM, and pop.<br/><br/>Software updates still come from time to time and have made noticeable improvements to the sound and features.<br/><br/>I paid full price at release and don't regret it. I think these are well worth the current price and would buy them again.</span>

<span>I’ve been using these earbuds for around a month and they are fantastic! Fit is snug (I use the XS ear tips). It’s important to take some time to figure out the fit, as the sound quality and noise cancellation depend on it. The earbuds are light and comfortable, and work seamlessly with Zoom on my PC. I can hear everyone and people can here me. I can walk around my apartment and still participate in a meeting!<br/><br/>It pays to spend a little time getting used to the touch controls, like press and hold right earbud for 7 seconds to reset and re-pair, or press and hold either earbud for two seconds to switch between “ambient noise,” “noise cancelling” and “off.” If you can hear a whistling sound when noise cancelling is on, the earbuds may not be snugly enough in your ears and you may need to twist them around a bit.<br/><br/>The reason for four stars instead of five is because switching devices is fiddly (requires deleting the earbuds and re-pairing) and because they cannot be connected to more than one device at a time. Ideally, I’d like to be able to have them connected to my phone as well as my PC, but these earbuds will only connect to one bluetooth device at a time. There is an iPhone app, but I haven’t used it as I only use these earbuds for Zoom on my PC. It would be useful for this app to also be available on Windows which would give more control to the volume etc.<br/><br/>I’m very happy with this purchase and I highly recommend them! Great value for the price. I previously tried a $40 pair of earbuds and there is just no comparison in terms of quality, sound or ease of use.</span>

<span>The earbuds are super lightweight (including the case) and high quality. It says water resistance and it is real!!! I accidentally dropped one into a sink filled with water. I picked it up panicking but it was totally fine (phewwww). The metal is like brushed matte rose gold, super pretty! It comes with different sizes silicone ear pieces for better fitting. I love how they have an app for this. Can customize to different bass / vocal and stuff like that. Battery is decent. I only need to charge them twice a week max if use it less frequent, every other night if use it more in a day. The only thing I’m not quite sure is the noise cancellation. I don’t really get that even I tried to adjust it with the app. It was okay but not like what I expected. Overall, I think this is great product with the value.</span>

<span>I love these earbuds! I honestly think they’re easier to use than AirPods, and they sit more comfortably in my ears. I like that they don’t have a part that dangles down, like AirPods do. And the rose color is so pretty! They connected to my phone quickly, and they’re quick to connect as soon as I put them into my ears. Very easy to pause or play what I’m listening to. The only thing I think is strange is that although they’ve already connected after I’ve put them in my ears, they have to connect again when I jump on a video call. So the first few seconds of the call are interrupted with the sounds of it’s re-connection. Otherwise, I think they’re great and super high quality!</span>
