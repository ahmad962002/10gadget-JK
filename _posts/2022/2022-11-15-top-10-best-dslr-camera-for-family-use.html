<span>Came broken at first (Dead pixels on image sensor). I ended up getting it from Microcenter for an even cheaper price and the camera is awesome. I love it.

<span>This camera is my first DSLR and it has been an incredible experience shooting in a variety of contexts and formats. I brought this camera on my trip and used the automatic presets for the majority of the trip but started learning from YouTube how to manually adjust each camera setting and realized how powerful this camera can be during photo shoots.<br/><br/>If you’re looking for long range high-depth shots, the lens that comes with this camera will be a let down. I suggest researching lenses before purchasing this camera so you can understand the full scope of costs associated with what you’re looking for as accessories can quickly up the costs. Additionally, consider purchasing a camera bag and definitely purchase an SD card.</span>

<span>The specification is in the product listing for everyone see, so I won't review that, other than to say that this camera is a good specification for the price. I'll aim this review towards detailing my experience with using this camera. People looking at this model are likely comparing it to the similarly priced Canon model. Both brands are quite comparable, so at this level of the market it is really a matter of personal preference as to which brand you choose - and the current deals and discounts on offer. I choose the Nikon D3100 camera with the kit 18-55mm lens over the Canon model because I got a large discount off the second lens I wanted - the 55-200mm. (I see now that Amazon sells the camera with this lens in addition to the 18-55mm as an option, but this wasn't an option back when I bought then.) I thought with these two lenses I would have an adequate kit to get started in DSLR photography, although either a 35mm or 50mm prime FX lens is next on my wishlist. (FX lenses work fine on a DX body such as the D3100, although with a 1.5x effective focal length boost so I can somewhat future proof my lens purchases in the event I eventually upgrade to a better camera body.)<br/><br/>I bought my camera and lenses back in April 2013 and decided to use it for several months before I reviewed them. I was heading on a trip a month later that I wanted this camera to accompany me on, and also wanted time to get to grips with the step up from many years of just using point and shoots before I offered a public opinion. I had wanted a DSLR for years, but couldn't justify the cost to myself, (I have kids and feel guilty spending money on myself), and so I had already read several books that explained the science of taking photos in a fully manual mode with a DSLR but I had never so much as picked up a DSLR before buying one. From using both film camera and digital point and shoots I was already fairly experienced and proficient in the composition aspect of taking a photo as well as in using image processing software such as Lightroom, Photoshop (Elements) and Paint Shop Pro to improve my photos. Of course, with a point and shoot or a scanned film photo I was forced to edit lossy JPG files - and now with a DSLR I can process native RAW files, (.NEF format on the Nikon), and the results from this change alone are phenomenal! I was amazed by just how much detail can be found in a RAW file using Adobe Lightroom 5 from what looks like a flat white or black area in an over/under exposed area. I'll never shoot in JPEG again if I have an option to shoot in a native RAW format.<br/><br/>When I had received the camera I read the manual from cover to cover while the battery fully charged. I then jumped in my car and headed off on a drive to somewhere fairly scenic but local(ish) to test out my new purchase. I was determined that I would rarely use the fully AUTO mode unless I wanted to take an unplanned rush shot of something I'd miss photographing otherwise.<br/><br/>My several hours that day out taking photos was a very educational (and fun) time for me, and certainly cemented my enthusiasm to learn more about photography that I had hoped I would have when taking the jump up to a DSLR.  I toyed around taking photos of things with differing apertures in Aperture Priority mode until I was comfortable controlling the depth of field, (as best I could with the kit lens.) took photos of things both close, and the mountains far away, at varying focal lengths, confirming for myself various aspects of photography I had read so much about but hadn't been able to practice and experiment with before fully, (e.g. bringing the background scenery closer while keeping a foreground subject a constant size.) Back home that evening I went out in the back yard and mounted my new camera on an old tripod I have with the 55-200mm lens and took photos of the moon and my house in the dark until I better understood shutter speed settings and how different ISO settings affect the photos I take. Again, this was all stuff I'd read about, but never really fully had practical experience with regard to my own photographs before. My kids were also willing models so I could experiment with portraiture.photos using different settings until I achieved the effects I wanted or could achieve with just the kit lens and it's lack of a large aperture (small f-stop).<br/><br/>Over the next few weeks before the family trip I planned to take this DSLR on with me, I picked the camera up and experimented daily. I took better photos every day and started to instinctively know what settings to use in full manual mode - my first guesses became increasingly correct, or were otherwise a pretty good starting point to fine tune when I had set the camera incorrectly for the conditions or photo I wanted.<br/><br/>This is a tremendous camera to learn with and takes fabulous photos. My family went on the trip overseas. I took close to 3000 photos in the weeks we were traveling. Granted, I used the camera in a continuous shooting mode almost exclusively -- taking several photos of the same scene to try to guarantee a good shot - especially when photographing movement or people, so the total figure was bumped up somewhat.<br/><br/>If I'm taking photos left, right and center, I do now cheat a little and use Aperture Priority mode quite a lot so I just control the depth of field and let the camera do most of the rest, (although I retain control of the ISO as the camera seems to do a poor job in auto mode sometimes.) If I am planning a photo that I want to be proud of, I will still switch to full manual mode for the satisfaction that I am "making" a photo rather than just "taking" a photo. Oftentimes though, when out and about, one of the semi-manual modes (Shutter Priority or Aperture Priority modes) are all that is required to get the shot wanted and are a time-saver to use. Okay, I admit it - I sometimes use Auto-mode now too...<br/><br/>I hope others decide to take the plunge from a point-and-shoot camera to a DSLR and ignite a similar passion for photography. I'm very happy with my purchase.</span>

<span>I recently purchased the D3100 and have taken some shots in a variety of conditions.  I have not yet had the opportunity to dive into the full feature set.  Initial impressions:<br/>Pros: Very nice image quality (my primary concern), easy to use, includes reasonable editing software.<br/>Cons: Nikon is bit stingy when packing the box (no USB cable, no memory card at all); no exposure bracketing feature.<br/><br/>So far, I have been very pleased with the images coming from the D3100.  The colors are true and vibrant.  It handles light and shadow well.  The captured detail is impressive.  I haven't "pushed" this camera yet with higher ISO shots or other more demanding techniques / settings however, I suspect that many of this camera's users, if not most, will not have the need or desire to wander too far away from the "Auto" setting, which does a very capable job in variety of conditions.  The flash works well with the camera and there is a minimum of the "over exposed" or "glare" look that is commonly seen in family flash photography.<br/><br/>This camera at its most basic level is dead simple to use: point and shoot.  The camera may look intimidating to those who haven't previously used a full featured film camera or a DSLR but, pick it up, set it to "Auto", snap a few frames and you'll both feel much more comfortable with it and intrigued to learn more about its other capabilities.  This camera is targeted for the entry DSLR market and anyone moving up from a compact point-and-shoot camera will immediately recognize the difference in image quality.<br/><br/>The Nikon software was also easy to use and can really bring out the impact in your shots.  The software installed without problem on my mac.  Through the software, I was able to pull additional depth and detail from the initial captured image (I used RAW format for capturing).  I did use the default JPEG as well and I doubt that many family photographers will have any complaint with those images.  Again, the various sliders and options in the software can seem daunting at first, but you will be rewarded by playing around with settings (you won't ruin anything).  As mentioned previously, through the software, I was able to take some images that would have been OK and make them compelling.  I am not saying that they will be hanging in a gallery soon, just that they are far more visually interesting than they were and with a minimal amount of effort.  The images included people, nature, indoors and out.<br/><br/>I am not completely sold on the auto focusing, especially when the subject is in motion.  I haven't used it enough in these circumstances to fairly comment, just something that has initially popped up as an item to explore further.  For the record, the images in question seemed sharp though not quite what I had anticipated.  It is too early to hang AF from my uses, though.<br/><br/>I have not used (and have no immediate intention of using) the video feature.  I have a video camera that shoots video well.  Personally, I'd rather have additional still features (auto bracketing) than video.  I understand that there may be a desire to pack everything within one device from a marketing perspective.  However, I am of the mind that a device ought to focus on its primary mission and forgo additive items that it does less well.<br/><br/>I have no understanding of why Nikon would not include a USB cable to connect the camera to your computer.  Fortunately, the cable is not proprietary and I was able to reuse an existing cable from another camera.  How exactly does Nikon propose that you transfer your images from the camera to your machine for use with the included Nikon software?  That just doesn't make sense when the cable that I reused came included with a camera that cost $400 less than the D3100.<br/><br/>Overall, I am very happy with the image quality (which makes the omission of bracketing even more noticeable), the ease of use, and the included software.  I would have liked a starter memory card in the box and am really surprised that it did not include a USB cable.  The price for value relationship needs some improvement, though the product itself is solid.  This would be a good way to get into the DSLR segment for those moving up from compact point and shoot.</span>

<span>Our daughter complained for years that we didn't have a "GOOD" camera! So, when she graduated from college, and got her first job we bought her a "GOOD" camera, and she absolutely LOVES this one! Now my husband and I disagree about what constitutes and good camera - we've had Lumix's and Canon's, but she has wanted cameras where she could change out the lenses, and do more actual "artistic" photography! More power to her!<br/>This is a good one because it has menus on board - to let her know what to do while she's taking pics - so she can learn as she goes, but it also came with a good manual, and plenty of online resources. The lenses are pricier than the Canon lenses, but after doing some research, I felt they were also better lenses, and she was getting more bang for the buck!<br/>At first it seemed like I was paying more for a similar Canon camera, but when I actually saw what the two cameras could do, there was no question in my mind that I wanted her to have the Nikon! It was everything she wanted - great variety of lenses, shake control, pop up light - or you can add add'l pro lighting and props, etc. It's everything from everyday to a low end pro camera. Perfect to a entry level high end camera for the more persnickity camera aficionado! I was thrilled to be able to get it for her ... she most certainly earned it after graduating 10th in her H.S. class of 400 with an International Baccalaureate Degree, and  a National Merit Scholar. Then going on to graduate from the Ohio State University with double majors in Management and Operations with Honors, and getting offers from her 1st two choices of companies - Amazon and Eaton Corp! She had to turn one down - Amazon - have you seen their crazy warehouse operations?!  Yikes! Anyway she's very happy where she is, and will be doing a rotation once every year for the first 3 years with Eaton, and then hopefully be offered the job of a lifetime - depending on what is available at the time - she'll be in the pool with all else at the time.<br/>But in the meantime with all the moving around she'll have plenty of time to get to know and use her great new camera! I can't wait to see what she comes up with! As soon as this posts, I have some posts I'll move over here from some of the pics she's done so far! Fun girl stuff! Cant wait till her trip to TX = she's never been and plans to do the whole cowgirl experience! LOL<br/>Sorry if this got too personal and not enough camera oriented -- I'll ammend after I re-read - I'm punchy right now ... It's 5:04 AM and I've been up over 24 hrs zzzzzzz!</span>

<span>For many years, I used a Nikon FG, which was a mid-level camera.  Took great pictures if you knew what you were doing, but of course it was a film camera.  Then came digital cameras.  For the last 10 years, I was basically using point and shoot cameras, which were great for general landscapes.  No longer being interested in standing in darkrooms inhaling photo processing chemicals, I opted for a digital SLR where I could do any further processing on the computer.  As a birthday gift to myself, I got the Nikon D3100.  Took it out the first few days and achieved less than thrilling results; my point &amp; shoots gave me better pictures.  So I took a look at the manual which helped only marginally.  I don't think it was orginally written in English and may have lost some in the translation.<br/><br/>Common sense told me that Nikon couldn't have put out a $500+ camera that only takes so-so pictures.  I looked on Amazon and found 3 books written especially for this camera, and I bought one. </span>
<a class="a-link-normal" data-hook="product-link-linked" href="/Nikon-D3100-Digital-Field-Guide/dp/0470648651/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Nikon D3100 Digital Field Guide</a>
<span>. Going over just the first few chapters of this book made a huge difference.  I'm now getting incredible images.  My problem was that photography had progressed immensely while I was playing around with the point &amp; shoots.  This camera takes advantage of these new advances, plus it sounds like it's made a few advances of its own.  It's a very sophisticated camera, but it's also initially complicated, and there is a learning curve.  The book explains the camera in detail using plain English, and as a result I'm learning a lot about the camera and about digital photography in general, even though I thought I knew a lot.<br/><br/>I am only now beginning to appreciate this camera.  It provides you with an incredible amount of control, from very subtle to blatantly obvious.  The display on the back of the camera provides technical information, easy to use menus, and allows you to zoom in on the images to make sure they are in focus and to check on exposure of details or shadows.  The 18-55mm lens included in the kit is great except that the maximum aperature opening is 3.5 (I was used to 1.8 on my old Nikon).  The auto focusing gives you many options, and when used correctly, the focusing is perfect and sharp.  As with all autofocus lenses, the manual focusing is touchy and not at all like the old manual lenses, however, I've really not had much need to focus manually, so it's not much of an issue.<br/><br/>Although it can be used as such, it's not a point &amp; shoot camera, and therefore it is somewhat bulky.  And unlike my old FG, it's mostly plastic.  I think that's life nowdays; plastic is king.  The neckstrap is kind of cheesy.  The camera kit comes with a battery (I might get a second in case, but I'm surprised at how long it does last), and a plug-in charger.  Included in the box is software for manipulating your pictures on the computer.  I haven't installed this yet because I use </span>

<span>, although at some point I may try it just for fun.  There is also another disk which is an extended version of the printed manual; basically it suffers from the same problem as the printed one.  What doesn't come with the camera is the USB cable, which I think stinks.  Fortunately I had one from an old Palm Pilot that worked.  The camera, by the way, does include 2 ferrite cores.  I had to research what those were; they wrap around near one end of the USB cable to prevent interference when uploading your pictures.  Considering using it because without it I kept getting uploading errors.<br/><br/>I didn't plan on writing this much, but really there is much to say about this camera.  Bottom line is that I really like it.</span>

<span>I purchased this camera after purchasing a Lumix FZ1000Mk2, to compare the two. The FZ300 was US$300 cheaper, and I wondered if I could get by with it instead of the FZ1000Mk2. I found the form factor to be a bit small for my larger hands, and didn't really care for the zoom control on the lens barrel. There have been some instances "in the wild" of the zoom lever surrounding the shutter release failing, so having a secondary zoom control is good, but this one seemed somewhat vague.<br/><br/>My background is a series of digital point and shoot cameras going back to the Agfa 1250. I've had perhaps 10-12 digital cameras since that time, culminating in the Sony Alpha 900, with a complete, and I mean complete, kit of Minolta lenses for that body. That said, I got to the point where dragging along a backpack of lenses and filters to be more than I wanted. My Lumix LX5 and LX7 languished in a drawer, the iPhone 10Xr had taken on more and more photography duties, but it in itself let me down on many occasions, especially in low light.<br/><br/>I ended up getting the Canon G5X Mk2 as a new pocket camera with a better zoom range than the LX7. What I needed along with that was a super-zoom bridge camera to take the place of the lenses I was giving up with the Sony A900, and the furthest reach I had with that kit was an f8 500mm reflector...<br/><br/>In the end, I found that neither the FZ300 or the FZ1000Mk2 really met my needs and settled on the FZ2500, which while still a very good camera for stills, has a more impressive video capability, even though that is secondary to my needs. The FZ2500 has a weight and size that feels better to me, the ergonomic feel more like a traditional interchangable lens camera, and it will record video only limited by battery and memory capacity.<br/><br/>The FZ300 is a VERY capable camera, and it is a favorite among people who shot birds. The 1/2.3" sensor gives it better optical zoom reach. In the end, I wanted the larger camera and a 1" sensor to match the Canon. so the FZ300 was returned along with the FZ1000Mk2.<br/><br/>That said, I did recommend the FZ300 to my son-in-law as a Christmas gift for my daughter, and I believe she will be happy with it. Indeed, I think for anyone wanting something that is a huge step up from a smart phone, in a fairly light package (600+ grams) with weather sealing will appreciate this camera. It simply wasn't right for me.</span>

<span>I have been using the Canon for about a month now. Great entry level camera for a budding professional. Good grip, good design, good controls, hard plastic body looks like it will last. Touch screen works great! Love the old school viewfinder and it is the reason I bought it. That is the reason for 4 stars also. The viewfinder only works for taking photos! You cannot take video thru the viewfinder. You have to use the touchscreen. I bought camera for action photograph and videos. The photo part is perfect, the video part is unusable for my special circumstances in video of RC aircraft in flight. Bright days just blind the touchscreen. Also no 24fps in Full HD mode. Still a great value for the money. Pic quality is super. Love viewfinder for photos but won’t work for videos. The Dual Pixel auto focus is awesome on video to keep face in sharp focus. The audio on camera is just so so, I added external mic and it is a world of difference better. Love the fact that I can use legacy Canon lenses or the newest, as my budget allows. I got the 18-55 STM kit lens and it is a fine starter lens, especially for video (wide angle since the camera crops, especially with 4K video), it's silent, fast and relatively accurate. I also got a "nifty fifty" prime Canon 50mm lens that is Super for portraits and just to walk around with taking photos. I also got a Canon EF-S 55-250mm STM lens for excellent shots of RC planes in the air far away. I couldn't have gotten as far as I have without watching MANY Youtube reviews and hints/tricks videos that make it much easier to understand how to use the MANY features of this camera. The battery life is long and I have shot all day and never run out of battery. I don't like that 4K video is so cropped but I just stand farther back and it is OK. Also, the audio levels will show on the lcd screen but you have to go into the settings and take it off of Auto and put it in Manual to get it to work, it should be on by default Canon! The 9-point AF works great for moving objects (like planes) and I don't know why people complain that it is not enough. In conclusion...I love this camera! It is much better for photos than for video but I just bought a DJI Ronin SC gimbal to make the video portion much better, including Active Track, so I'm hoping that will work out fine. I know everything is going mirrorless but this is a great camera that works in the old world and in the new and should be all I need for the foreseeable future as an amateur and light-weight professional photographer.</span>

<blockquote><em><div class="a-row a-spacing-small review-data"><span class="a-size-base review-text review-text-content" data-hook="review-body">
<span>I purchased the K70 more or less knowing what I would be getting myself into.  I have over 15 Pentax lenses, even lenses from 1980 that can be used with this camera mount,  and at this point, it would not make sense for me to switch brands, because my glass collection is extensive.  With that being said, I dont want to come off sounding like a brand ambassador, which although I love Pentax, my last camera was a K50, and I experienced the dead aperture block, which Pentax is surely aware of, but had no interest in helping me fix it, even though it only had 1800 shutter count on it, I still feel a little salty about that.  With that being said, I always tell people to make the comparison with features that fit your needs......Being a hotly contested market for the 650 dollar price range, you cant really go wrong with any of the major manufacturers.  However there are a lot of features that I feel always push me towards Pentax, that the other manufacturers do not offer such as weatherproofing............ that def helps from a durability standpoint.  Not having to worry about weather really sets this camera apart from every other competitor in this price range.  No other manufacturer offers weather sealing at this price point.........Period.  The next REALLY important feature that you have to use to compare, is the fact that the body of the camera has image stabilization BUILT IN!  I cannot overstate how important that one feature alone is.......It allows you to use film era lenses, and manual lenses, without the need to buy EXPENSIVE lenses with Image Stabilization built into them.  Ergonomics.....................  Idk what it is, but whenever I go into Best Buy, I hold a Can, or Nikon and they just feel like a big chunk of plastic, but not of the solid variety.  Very hollow is my best feeling of those two brands. In my opinion they could afford to make the body smaller or more compact.  The K70 has no such issues.  It is a very solid body that is well crafted, and feels substantial in the hands, not hollow feeling.  All of the buttons and dials are within a quick reach to access all of the functions that need to be used on a daily basis.  A lot of thought goes into the ergonomics of Pentax cameras, and you can tell once your holding it, that this is a great feeling camera in the hands.  The menus have been uplifted, and simplified over previous  bodies, making it very easy to understand.  Another feature that cannot be overlooked, is the two dial system......one in front of the shutter for F stops, and another behind the shutter for other functions, as it is customizable.  Too many new cameras only have one dial, which really doesnt help when you need to reach certain functions.....with the K70, you can reach them without looking.  Nice little touches, like night mode, which makes the screen red, so its easy on the eyes, is really nice.  As far as image quality goes, I have not looked at other brands, however I can tell you by reactions of my photography from other people.........the usual reaction is........ WOW.  The pictures REALLY pop and have intense detail........doesnt matter what the subject is, the pictures always come out pleasant, and have excellent colors and saturation.  The move to an articulating screen which was new on the KS2 ( previous model) is a nice touch.  I always thought to myself......Why would I use a tilting screen?  But since I have it on this camera, I have been using it ALOT!  It really is a god send, when you are trying to take pictures in awkward positions........The focus in live view has also been improved extensively from older Pentax models, and there is no delay when taking pictures anymore......it just WORKS!  Another unique feature, is a mode in camera called Pixel Shift, where when taking the picture, the sensor moves to the right and to the left snapping off 3 frames, only increasing the quality of the image ( with a tripod of course)  I thought it to be gimmiky when reading about it, but wow, it really works well!  And then there is the penta prism that is used for the optical viewfinder.  Yes, you may think its a pretty small deal, but when you look through the K70s view finder, compared the other brands mentioned before, I feel like their viewfinders are DARK.  Not terrible, but not clear like the Pentax Penta Prism is.  Its bright, clear, and provides a 95% view of what you are taking a picture of.....where other brands are a lower %.....making it unpredictable, of what is going to fit in the frame when the picture is processed.  The last advantage over other brands, is the shutter speed.  1/6000 shutter speed really does make a difference.  You will see that other brands possess a 1/4000 max shutter speed, which in 2017 is unacceptable.....especially when you need to freeze the action, the shutter speed really makes a difference!<br/>Now the Bad.<br/>Not all bad news, but there are things that must be pointed out that I didnt cover in the Pros, because they deserve to be in the Cons section.<br/>Movie mode.  MEH, is the best description of movie mode.  Its there, and it has video autofocusing, but the movie mode is not very well hashed out.<br/>When moving the camera around, the movie becomes jittery, and wobbles.........but when you stop it goes back into focus.......but in all honesty, people do not buy Pentax for Video mode.  It is something that has plagued Pentax from the very first camera body that made use of video....they are woefully behind, but it doesnt really bother me...... I buy Pentax for its still imaging prowess......if you want a video camera, buy a video camera!<br/>Next is WiFI  Yes, it has Wifi, however its a little difficult to pair with your device, and a little hard to get it to work properly.  On top of that the pictures take over a minute to arrive at your phone or device.....IMO they need to improve upon this.  Its great in a pinch, when you want to send it to your phone, but it is in no way as seamless as it couldve been........You can use your phone to control almost all of the features, which is definitely a nice feature, but is a little slow..........<br/>The last thing, and I dont like to bring this up, because it does not hinder my photography ability whatsoever, but it could be a problem for people that rely on autofocus, that do not use manual settings.  It only has 11 focus points.  Is it fast?  I think it is.  I never EVER have an issue with it.  It usually decides on the focus pretty darn fast, and decisively, which is great.  Its just that other manufacturers cameras in this segment have 18-35 focus points.  Not a con for me, but may be for others.  I feel as though it does not have a lot of focus points, it still is really good with the 11 it has.<br/><br/>So in the end, would I recommend the K70?  Absolutely 100%  You simply cannot go wrong with owning this camera.......Its 24 MP sensor is crazy good......it takes wonderful pictures, and really has a wow factor with the colors and saturation that it renders, as long as the camera is shooting in RAW mode. (Which is 14 Bit BTW!) JPEGs are good, but the RAW pictures are incredibly detailed.  If you have even a little photography skill, this camera will do wonders for you.  I have owned over 10 Pentax cameras, and every one of them has been great for me over the years, except for the K50!  I had a film era K1000 body, and even then, I thought it took more pleasing pictures than the Minoltas, and Canons that I have owned in the film era, and even after a 30 year journey of photography personally, Pentax still offers that value that stands out from the other brands.</span>

<span>I've held off reviewing this camera for several months, so I would have a real feel for what I was talking about. This is a feature rich camera for its price, which is why I chose it. I shoot a lot of high school sports under the most horrible of lighting conditions, so very little of my work is done under ideal conditions and it should be noted that this will significantly influence my comments. I shoot only RAW, and can't really speak to JPEG performance.<br/><br/>High ISO performance it pretty respectable. Not outstanding, but respectable. I get away with an awful lot of high ISO stuff that would be seriously unusable with older cameras.<br/><br/>I mostly use spot focus for sports, but I have noticed that when using 12 or 5 point focusing the camera invariably guesses wrong on what is my intended subject. Lots of other cameras do better in this regard.<br/><br/>I use back button focus almost exclusively and frankly the AF/AE-L button is in a very awkward location for my hand  There is a nice thumb rest on the back of the camera which frequently obstructs me from reaching the AF button due to a raised ridge. Fumbling for the button has caused me to miss shots and even inadvertently hit the function wheel and accidently set the camera to 10 second timer mode. Not a good thing when you are shooting sports.<br/><br/>The strap that ships with the camera is a non starter. Actually painful around my neck. As I tend to hang the camera around my neck during breaks, the first thing I did was buy a third party strap.<br/><br/>Auto focus is lightning fast with Pentax's 55 - 300 PLM lens and respectably fast with my other Pentax lenses and Sigma and Tamron lenses I own.<br/><br/>Auto white balance is always pretty close, though I do use a grey card for most environments. The required corrections are usually pretty minor.<br/><br/>And now for my biggest complaint. When shooting in continuous mode the file numbers are not always in the proper sequence and the capture time doesn't record fractions of a second and therefore the shots are frequently out of sequence. That is a royal pain for someone who shoots sports or anything else where sequence matters.<br/><br/>Got to test the weather resistance of the camera shooting a football game in continuous rain a couple of days ago. No problems at all.<br/><br/>Battery performance in inexcusably poor.<br/><br/>Those issues aside, I get decent to really good images in horrible conditions and am pretty happy with the camera overall. The review emphasizes the negatives, because if you're looking at buying this camera those are things you need to know.<br/><br/>I'm using the camera with a variety of lenses. I have the Pentax 55-300 PLM WR, the Pentax 55-300 WR,  the Pentax 50mm f/1.8, an old Pentax 35-80 that I got really cheap, A Sigma 10-20 f/3.5, a Sigma 17-50 f/2.8 and a Sigma 70-300 with macro. I also have a Tamron 70-300 with macro that is just horrible. Don't buy that.</span>

<blockquote><em><div class="a-row a-spacing-small review-data"><span class="a-size-base review-text review-text-content" data-hook="review-body">
<span>I bought the Pentax K-70 primarily for video purposes.  I already had several vintage lens that belonged to my K-1000 that fit perfectly being they both used the same K mount design.  This camera has been very reliable in the 5 months I've had it.  The video quality on the camera is standard 1080p, and when using the right settings looks great for any videography and film work.  I will admit there are better cameras out there for the use of video recording.  However if you are looking for a camera that is at least equal in video quality, you will most likely spend a couple 100 dollars more.  The price is a real winner here.<br/><br/>Concerning Photography.<br/>Photographs are exceptional.  The 24 megapixal quality is amazing and brings in a high dynamic range.  When shooting in dark environments it really captures dark areas well.  Burst photography is also very good.  I have done time lapse photography on a couple occasions and the 4k videos are stunning.  The in body shake reduction allows you to use slower shutter speeds than you would normally be able to use without a tripod.  The ISO settings are most effective between 100-3200.  After 3200 you will get a high noise level.  The camera will go up to an ISO of about 16,400 I believe.  After working with the camera a lot I would say the ISO is most effective at 400.  The camera will also allow you to create custom white balances and plug in the exact color temperature in Kelvins.  The pixel shift function also greatly enhances photographs.  That function must be used on a tripod however.<br/><br/>Concerning Video<br/>I was happy that most of setting optimization that pertains to photography also is allowed in the video section.  Many of the cheaper DSLR cameras only allow auto functions for the video and I find that a great dis-service on those cameras.  The camera allows you to set it to 24, 25, 20, 50i, and 60i for the frame rates.  Keep in mind that if you are editing and using timecode that these translate translate to the electric interpretation for example, 24 frames per second is really 23.978 fps.  One thing that does disappoint me is that when shooting video you have to really play with the settings when filming white walls.  White walls tend to get noisy and sometimes you get a color fluctuation in out of focus areas.  The best way to avoid this is to really expose the room with lights and adjust the f stop, shutter speed and ISO accordingly.  When the ISO is set correctly dark spaces are captured quite nicely and without too much noise.  Otherwise the video quality is great in the 1080p format class when compared to other cameras.  One thing you should know is to turn off Shake Reduction when using the camera on a tripod.  The camera sensor will move with head turning and people standing up our of chairs.  Only use Shake Reduction when going hand held. The shake reduction works awesome when used hand held.  Keep in mind most DSLR cameras (including this one) will only let you record for 30 minutes at a time, regardless of SD card size.  So this is not a good choice if you are needing to do extended recording such as a basketball game or a ceremony.<br/><br/>Concerning Camera Software.<br/>The software that comes with the camera is a little slow but it processes DNG images excellently.  The Pentax K-70 allows you to shoot in DNG or their Proprietary format DNG+.  The DNG+ is better and if you can handle working with the camera software it will produce slightly better images.<br/><br/>Trouble Shooting<br/>The only issue I have had with the camera is on one occasion the camera began to save very slowly.  If if I took a photo, it would take 10 seconds to save.  Video was taking 5-10 minutes to save.  I solved this issue by using a different SD card.  The normal save times resumed.<br/><br/>Durability and Ergonomics.<br/>This camera feels solid in your hand.  It gives you a good grip as well.  Despite being a compact camera it is definitely made for people with big hands (not a problem for me). Button feel is good.  My last point and shoot camera (a FujiFilm HS-10) had very cheap buttons that always felt like they were gonna fall off.  All of your important functions such as Aperture, Shutter Speed, ISO, PHOTO/VIDEO Mode, White Balance, ISO, Timed Photo, flash, and Auto Focus versus Manuel Focus are all given physical buttons rather than being buried in menus.  The Shutter speed, Aperture, AF vs MF, and PHOTO versus Video are made to be dials or switches which is quite handy.  The camera is rated to be water resistant (not water proof).  I have not gone out of my way to test this but I have shot in rain and it performed fine.  To be water resistant however you must use a water resistant lens.  If you buy a lens that comes with the camera it will have an o ring around the lens mount that services this feature.<br/><br/>Cons<br/>If you are looking for a camera that has good autofocus, then this is probably not a good choice for you.  For photos the autofocus works pretty good.  For Video it hardly adjusts.  I bought this camera knowing this.  If you don't trust your ability to manually focus then this is not the camera for you.</span>

<span>Depending on circumstances autofocus can be jumpy.  I have owned Pentax KS-2 prior to this purchase and have never had issue with stabilization.  The camera is capable of producing really good quality images.  Camera also has very good weather sealing.  Would I replace my D850 or D800 with this camera? No!  But I do enjoy using this camera for general purpose photography.</span>

<span>I have a degree in photography, and I currently have a Cannon DSLR. I have been looking for a bridge camera with a large optical zoom to take with me on trips, so I don't have to carry 3-4 lenses.  I also wanted to have a camera the I would be allowed into concert venues. This camera is light and easy to use. The main reason I purchased this camera is the ability to save as RAW photos. I admittedly have only had the camera for a few days. I am loving it. The ability to shoot in 4K burst came in handy while photographing the hummingbirds in my yard. I purchased the camera thru Adorama. Received the camera before it was expected. Customer Service is quick and efficient. Thanks Adorama!</span>

<span>I have a few cameras and I’ve been using digital cameras since the 90s. Most of them are fairly similar and user-friendly. I’ve only been using it for two months and I’ve already had a lot of problems setting it for macro and for close-up shots. If you go into the settings and start changing things you’ll notice that there is so many settings that you really don’t need or would never thing to use. I don’t want to have to take a course to use a simple digital camera. Even though I have taken a course! As with most digital products it’s all in the software. I would say this has a poor user interface and confusing directions and you can blame it all on the software. I’ve taken some very beautiful pictures with this. But I’ve also spent hours trying to figure out why it won’t focus on macro. If you just want a Camera to take nice shots I would probably steer clear of this one. Get a Nikon.</span>

<span>Pros:<br/>The zoom is truly awesome in this.  No SLR lens can compare.  It's great for birdwatching, zooming in on a face in the crowd, wildlife shots, and even just cool stuff that's a long way away.<br/>4k video is great.  I'm a Canon SLR person and they don't have 4k in the low or mid-range for an SLR, so that's why I got this and it is great.<br/>Fast FPS.  The camera can take 4k video, which is 8mp at 30fps.  It claims it will do it in 4k Burst mode, which really means it takes a 4k video and will show you frame by frame and let you select ones to make photos.  Horrible to do on the camera's screen, I wound up getting software that would do it on my PC and just pulling all the images out.  Which you can do from any video, so this is an ineffective feature (at least for me).  I wanted something that would create 30 images/second, which I could go through on a real screen and post quickly.  As this feature is why I chose the Lumix over a Nikon, I'm a little annoyed at their implementation.<br/>Cons:<br/>Low light conditions for moving subjects are awful.  To the point that you will have low light issues in places you didn't realize were low light, and there is no "action" choice on the selector.  The F2.8 for the lens in wide isn't matched by a very sensitive sensor, or it's not automatically upping the sensitivity as needed.  I have a ton of blurry shots of my kids because of this.  I've played with the light levels and it is cludgey at best, completely ineffective at worst.  I've hit a sweet spot a couple of times by setting it to 1/60th of a second, but it still has issues (and my kids aren't that fast).  This is an AMAZING outdoor daytime camera, but for kids in a bounce house it doesn't work for me.<br/>No Focus Ring, so obstructed zoom is hit or miss.  Generally, zoom and autofocus are fantastic and FAST.  This means that taking a picture of wildlife that is partially obstructed by a branch means that you may get a fantastic shot of a leaf instead of the Pileated Woodpecker you were trying for.  Also, since the aperture only goes to F-8, there's a limit to how much depth you can get so that crystal clear leaf may only be 6 inches closer than the woodpecker, but, oh well.<br/>Very limited options on the selection wheel. They've got the fab 5 (auto, P, A, S, M), then Expressive (for filters), Portrait, Panoramic, C? (maybe custom, but defaults to 1080p/60fps), and then Video (for adjusting settings in video mode)<br/>My last complaint is the smallest, the features (like C above) are poorly explained on screen (aperture is only "A", which isn't useful to noobs), which means that Panasonic style features are not understandable to people with more experience.  I accidentally turned on the feature of take 3 shots and merge them which doesn't work for kids moving (but would be great for landscape shots).  Missed 1/2 of my kids' Karate class trying to fix it instead of taking pictures.<br/><br/>Overall, this is an AWESOME camera if you are taking zoomed pictures or videos in sunlight, or of non-moving subjects.  The autofocusing on a leaf can be annoying, but survivable.  The wifi, etc. is nice but not particularly useful for me.  I have tested it and it'd be great to put on a monopod and use your phone to selection shots in a crowd.  And for $300, no SLR can compare on value.  However, once Canon comes out with the T8i, if the 4k is good, I'll likely put this on craigslist.  Because of the crappy low light, I still use my Canon T4i if I'm going somewhere like the Baltimore Aquarium or Natural History Museum with my boys, and this camera should have put my T4i to bed.</span>

<span>My son had been using my digital camera for a while, but then decided he wanted his own.  He looked at several deals and different kinds of digital cameras and found PixPro.  He really has been enjoying his new camera at school, with his pet dog, and family.  He can't wait to learn more about how to use it for cool things.  Oh, and that zoom is far better than digital zoom.</span>

<span>This a most capable, small camera whose features I'm only beginning to master. Picture quality is superb and the features are considerable. The zoom is very impressive in quality and power. The supplied bundle provides everything one needs including a large camera bag. I was actually hoping for the smaller holster type bag pictured in the Amazon ad. The only thing that the camera is missing is the ability to accept filters. Impressive quality at a very reasonable price that I highly recommend.</span>

<span>Bought this camera two days before trip to Yellowstone and Jackson hole. This camera had the two things I required. EVF View finder, and wide angle to long lens. And a long lens it does have!<br/>  After receiving it on the first day I charge the battery and went into the backyard to take some pictures. We Are blessed to have a beautiful pond in the backyard and a Male Mallord duck just happen to be standing out on a rock at 25 feet. Took a couple pictures of him and then zoom right into his face including his beak head and neck. The clarity was outstanding and the color unbelievable.<br/>  I am also an RC pilot so the next day took it out to the RC airfield.</span>
