<span>I bought this specifically for the feature that allows copying music from various media onto a USB drive.  This feature did not work. I have now returned it twice and none of the three units had this functional.  The last one also did not have an operating CD drive either. Because of the time elapsed with all this I hope I can finally get someone to refund my money. Disappointed with the vendor, importer and, of course, the factory.</span>

<span>I bought these speakers about a year ago for use with my new turntable. They are great! Very stylish, compact, great sound/bass. I've used these with both my turntable and for playing music from my phone. Both sound great! I definitely recommend these, great bang for your buck.</span>

<p> </p>
<blockquote><em><div class="a-row a-spacing-small review-data"><span class="a-size-base review-text review-text-content" data-hook="review-body">
<span>I bought these speakers because I like my music loud and the onboard speakers on my turntable were not cutting it. I’m primarily using this for vinyl but streaming via Bluetooth is a must too.<br/><br/>That said, the speakers were easy to set up and have really clean sound quality, even with vinyl (used with a Crosley turntable). I haven’t used Bluetooth much yet but it was easy to pair and initial test plays sound fine. The speakers are a great size and will fit on the shelf or in a cabinet. The speakers are clear when played at a loud volume. I’ve read comments about the lack of bass… I do agree that they’re not very deep, but that’s not important for me.<br/><br/>The one thing I don’t like is the volume knob. The knob itself is metal and feels strong, but the dial isn’t very tight so the control is weird.<br/><br/>All things considered, not bad for under $100! They get the job done for me.</span>

<span>I have enjoyed good music in my 70 years on earth.  I started like many others, when I was a young teenager with the Stones, Beatles and The Who.  My mind was treated to new audio sensations when I started listening to Pink Floyd and the Moody Blues and the like.  I have NEVER stopped enjoying music.  I appreciate many styles of music from Classical, New Age, Piano Solos to Classic Rock,  Hard Rock and screaming guitar solos and heart trobbing drum beats (AC/DC)  You can't begin to enjoy the nuances of these songs without the proper equipment.<br/><br/>Over the years I have gone thru the 33 1/3 era, buying many different turntables &amp; cartridges, looking for the perfect comgination for that just right sound. Then came Audio Cassettes, then Mini-Discs, then CDs, now MP3s, each getting better &amp; better.  Of coarse my bank account got smaller and smaller as I insisted on having the best quality I could afford. I always updated my entire sound system so it kept up with the new technology.  Not the most expensive but good enough.  I ran a small Mobile DJ business for 15 years back in the 80's  I carried about 500 lbs of the biggest and baddest sound system I could get.  My client reviews always came out with high marks cause the sound system kicked ass.<br/><br/>What does all this babble have to do with these speakers that I have never heard of in my life? Well.... THEY KICK ASS!!!<br/><br/>I was setting up an exersise gym in my livingroom (Wierd?) and wanted some self powered bookshelf speakers to listen to a few tunes while I used the new Nautilus Treadmill.  I came across the Edifiers R1280T's and started reading the reviews and was slightly dissapointed with some of the negative reviews.  BUT.... there were plenty of satisfied customers to convince me to order them.<br/><br/>I set them up on a piece of furniture with my 32" Visio TV &amp; trusty Tivo. I plugged in a few wires &amp; cables turned on the TV, pulled up the concert on the Tivo of John Fogerty: The Long Road Home and it starts off with "Playing in a Traveling Band"  I cranked those speakers up so loud I thought they were going to melt.  The bass notes were clean and solid.  the specs on these speakers say 75 to 18k frequency response but It sounds like a much bigger range than that.  The vocals are clear,  the guitar breaks will give you chills. The audience cheering makes you think you are there.  It almost makes me want to smoke some of that wacky stuff. When finished I logged on to Pandora music streaming to the "New Age Piano Solo" channel and lowered the volume down to a whisper.  Beautiful, Beautiful clean full music!!<br/><br/>These Edifiers are the best bookshelf size speakers I have ever owned!!  I am really impressed.  I wish everyone could come over to my house and I'll put on a thrilling rock party for you. (even at 70 I still get the itch for a party)  Next test,  I'm gonna plug in my Samsung Galaxy S7e and crank it up on a song by Golden Earring: "Radar Love" and let it work it's way thru the other 1000+ songs.  It works great on Smart Phones Tablets &amp; Laptops.<br/><br/>I am very pleased with these speakers.  I wish you could hear what I hear.  You can!!  GO BUY YOUR OWN. PLAY IT LOUD and ENJOY!<br/>Hope this helped.</span>

<span>I originally bought some Alesis M1 speakers because I had a set of their higher end monitors and was very pleased with them.  I was looking for nearfield monitors that were less on the thud side and more on the midrange side of town, since I'm using them for production.  I wrote a review about the Alesis.  Alesis are a great company, but those speakers were absolutely dreadful.  I spent $91 on those used.  Unlistenable.<br/><br/>I was resigned to having to shell out the bigger bucks to get some NS10's.. which of course do the job better than anything, but are hard to listen to for long periods of time.  I wanted something that was accurate, small and musical.<br/><br/>So I started listening to tests on youtube through my Sony MDRV6 headphones (5hz-35khz!) of every monitor I could find that might fit the bill for what I was looking for.<br/><br/>I had not heard of Edifier, but my research started with discovering the 1280db's, which sound great, really.  But in another test I listened to 1280db against the 1280T that made me opt instead for the 1280T.  The 1280T's were more balanced to my ears.<br/><br/>Then I listened to every single other test I could find of the 1280T's against a paragon of great speaker manufacturers., JBL, Genius, Behringer, Alesis, Pioneer.. even a few Bose models, the bookshelf and multimedia speakers specifically (NEVER use Bose for monitoring).<br/><br/>I did the test in HD with my eyes closed so that I could truly determine which sounded not just better, but that seemed to offer a response you'd expect from nearfield monitors rather than loudspeakers.  I'm not looking for thudders - I'm looking for lots of detail and accuracy in the midrange.<br/><br/>The 1280T's kept taking the proverbial cake.  They have a very musical characteristic about them without coloration.  There is no wonk on these speakers.  I think what these guys really got right was the balance.  Even against higher Edifier models, this one really was more pleasing to my ears, again looking for detailed midrange response and to be used as near field monitors.<br/><br/>They sound way more expensive than they are. (I owned a few $300-$600 monitors including Alesis and JBL).  I paid $79.  Unreal.  I feel like a bandit.<br/><br/>The balance as I say is really exquisite.  Someone really gave a damn about how these things sound.  I was already impressed with the 1280db, but these are more balanced in the 200hz-400hz range.  The detail in the midrange is really superb.  The bass response, going AB between these, some Rockit 5's, car speakers and a Yamaha stereo system with a sub, is pretty accurate, leaning slightly on over emphasis.  So I went back to the speaker, dialed the bass response down 1 click, and voila!  Accurate (or as accurate as you could hope for $79) bass response.  The treble response is accurate with no compensation required on the speaker.  The treble balance is very musical.  Well blended.  These speakers sing like one unit, not like 2 woofers and 2 tweeters.  I also gave the Treble and Bass a good push to 10 and the speakers just got sweeter and beefier.  Really pleasant, although I plan to keep the speakers flat.  I think the boost and cut is set at 6db each way.. but I'm guessing.  Again I have no real need for those but it was nice to hear these things really kick.  You can make them thud if you want.  75hz-18khz is where they're rated and more than enough for my purposes.<br/><br/>They look nice to me (they don't look cheap anyway.). The construction appears to be quite solid.  The grills are straightforward and aesthetically, while not the sexiest looking piece of gear, makes up for it with unassuming awesomeness.  My friends had no idea the speakers sound that good from looking at them. They look a bit vintage even.  I'm down with that.<br/><br/>I've read some negative comments about the dials on the speakers.  I didn't mind them at all.  The Bass and Treble have a nice click for the 12 o'clock setting so you don't have to eyeball it and the Volume knob is infinite.  Doesn't stop rolling in either direction, which is fine.  I set it and leave it there.  I did give them a good crank (listenably loud) and they handled it no problem.  No audible distortion or clipping.  For near field monitors, these things have a TON of power.  WAAAY louder than I'd ever need them to be.  The company rates them at 42W (21 a side).  These speakers have no bluetooth connectivity, which I could care less about since I would never use that feature when working on music production.  You've got an Aux input and a "PC" input and that's IT.  Both are RCA.  A USB connection or a SPDF connection might be nice, but if they omitted those to keep the price down while focusing on giving you a great sounding speaker, then I'm all for it because they succeeded in that regard.<br/><br/>One of the best purchases I've made this year.  Will definitely look Edify up first next time I want to buy some speakers.  I hope they maintain their emphasis on simplicity and quality.  Unreal value for $79.. AWESOME!!</span>

<span>I got tired of reading endless forums about the "best budget desktop speakers" so I decided to purchase the following and compare them in real life against each other: Neumi BS5P | Micca PB42X | Klipsch ProMedia 2.1 THX | Edifier R1280T | Bose Companion 2 Series III | Edifier G2000.<br/><br/>I am not an audiophile, I am not technical. I have played instruments my whole life and run sound in some amateur settings, so I'm guessing I have a slightly more critical ear than the average listener, but definitely not of those truly dedicated to hi fidelity listening. I don't know proper terms. I took these notes kind of haphazardly, but they are listed in order of best to worst after personal testing. I intend to play games and listen to music with a slight preference towards gaming as I have another speaker system for music that I can use for music.<br/><br/>High level takeaway: the true battle is between the Neumi BS5P and the Micca PB42X. Between those 2 speakers, either would be the right choice of all these options depending on your intended use. I ended up choosing the Neumi because I am going to be playing games quite a bit, and they provided much better low end to fill out a lot of the sound effects. If I were choosing a speaker just for music listening, I would have gone with the Miccas as they have superior mid/high/vocal clarity. The Miccas have a good enough sub that I wouldn't be missing the low end on most music, but if I wanted to, I could just add a sub to fill out the lows on the Miccas (for edm type music).<br/><br/>_______________________________________________________________________________________________<br/><br/>Neumi BS5P 75-Watt $139.99 - My personal winner<br/>Pro:<br/>- Sounds full and satisfying right away<br/>- Great bass (almost as good as the dedicated sub on the Klipsch, definitely better than all other options without a dedicated sub. I've got adjacent neighbors so I won't ever go sub heavy anyways, so don't need a dedicated sub with the power these pull)<br/>- Decently clear mids/highs, though this is less defined than the Miccas. These get better after doing the firmware update, and get it much closer to the Micca's clarity, but still not quite as good<br/>- Bluetooth pairing quality stays really high (doesn't make a difference for me)<br/>Cons<br/>- Mids/highs/vocals still just not as good/clear/crisp as the Micca<br/>- Much larger than the other options (might be a pro if you're looking to fill a room with more volume - I'm not looking for that)<br/>- Need to update the firmware to get better mids/highs than out of the box (minor inconvenience but might scare some away)<br/><br/>Micca PB42X $109.99<br/>Pro:<br/>- Really nice, crisp/clean mid/highs (better than everything else) The vocals are bright and shiny, unrivaled by any other of these options<br/>- Doesn't seem to add much coloration (but this also leads to it feeling slightly emptier than the 1280T, could be good or bad)<br/>- Pretty good bass for what it is (far better than the G2000 and Bose, worse than the others)<br/>- It comes with a 2 part dc cable that's longer than others, and a longer mp3 cable than others (doesn't really matter, but it's nice)<br/>- Fairly flat (might be a good or bad thing for usage)<br/>Con:<br/>- Getting really nit picky just to find differences, but the connection cable on the back is a twisty, rather than a poke as the Edifiers have. Twistys just seem less stable/more exposed<br/>- Mids/lows start to sound more tinny in comparison to the mids/lows of the neumi, leaving a somewhat less satisfying feeling<br/>- Ultimately this feels a bit emptier than others with better subs, but is also definitely crisper/clearer<br/><br/>Klipsch ProMedia 2.1 THX Certified $144.99<br/>Pro:<br/>- Great sound out of the box<br/>- Great bass (only one with a dedicated sub, so that should be obvious)<br/>Con:<br/>- Decent mid/highs, but still not as crisp/clear as the Miccas<br/><br/>Edifier R1280T $129.32<br/>Pro:<br/>- Beautiful aesthetic<br/>- Good sound out of the box , there's not the obvious tinny sound of budget speaker<br/>- Volume, bass, and treble knobs<br/>- I'm satisfied with the sound immediately (I grew less satisfied with the sound the more I A/B compared to the Bose due to the coloration. I then adjusted the tilt of the speakers and it seemed to fix this coloration issue and bring more clarity to the mids/highs)<br/>- It's really minor, but the power plug is a plug and not a brick like all the others<br/>Con:<br/>- No sub out option<br/>- Definitely colors the sound to fill in the space more (which could be a pro for some people too). Ends up adding a layer of mud to the  overall sound<br/>- The mids/highs are really just muddy due to the coloration<br/><br/>Bose Companion 2 Series III $149.00<br/>Pro:<br/>- The mids/highs are nice and bright and clear<br/>- Really compact if you don't have a lot of desk space00<br/>- I'm satisfied with this sound out of the box<br/>- Seems not to color the sound (certainly not nearly like the R1280T), feels more accurate<br/>- Has an upward tilt so it seems to naturally position for the sweet spot<br/>Con:<br/>- Only a volume knob so no automatic control over bass/treble (I assume there's eq software that would fix this?)<br/>- Bass is a bit lacking (probably would be satisfied with the amount of bass if I weren't comparing against the others)<br/>- Something feels emptier about these speakers against the 1280T and Micca<br/><br/>Edifier G2000 $109.99<br/>Pro:<br/>- Decent bass and presence<br/>- The LED light is kind of nice<br/>Con:<br/>- Stupid startup car sound is absolutely childish and obnoxious<br/>- The LED light stays on (I think you can turn it off but who's going to go through the hassle of turning it off and on if you have to hear the stupid car sound at every startup)<br/>- Still clearly sounds like a budget speaker with a constant of tin/noise<br/>- Bass can wash out pretty easily at medium volumes<br/>- It crackles at other certain sounds like my incoming email ping<br/>- Not satisfied with this sound out of the box</span>

<span>wow I just got these speakers today, and just hook them up and all I can say is WOW! they are fantastic hooked up to my TV I have not even tried out yet, Any of the other capabilities that they have.

<span>Purchased these in 2019 and still going strong!  Paired these speakers with a gaming computer setup and they work perfectly.  Had the Bose computer speakers before and they were good, but these Edifier are amazing.  Clean, crisp, with a solid audio range for their size. I did add in a 6.5" sub to fill out the low end, but I wanted louder rumbles and explosions when gaming.  That said, I ran them for 2 years on their own, even in a larger room and the sound quality is fantastic. I'll never go back to the typical computer speakers ever again. BTW, these are directly plugged into my desktop 3.5mm speaker out port, direct to the speaker, twin RCA jack.</span>

<span>I'm not an audiophile turbo nerd, but I do know a decent-sounding set of speakers when I hear them. I debated between these and a set of Mackie CR5-XBT and I'm glad I went with these. They offer a decent range for the price of the speaker and sound great just to listen to music on. If I were to be mixing/mastering audio I would lean more towards the Mackie's for a flatter sound, but since I wanted to enjoy listening to music on my computer (3.5mm jack), phone (Bluetooth), and laptop (via Bluetooth) these worked perfectly.<br/><br/>Pros:<br/>- Decent sound quality for music, youtube, and gaming.<br/>- Comes with a wide range of cables in the box for connectivity.<br/><br/>Cons:<br/>- Bluetooth latency is very noticeable when watching youtube and playing games. But listening to music is fine. Just plug these into your Tv/PC if you're going to be gaming or watching video content.</span>

<span>This may be the best all around radio/record player I've ever had. I live out in the country, and I have not  always gotten the best radio reception. I'll just say I could never be sure that I'd get anything I wanted to hear when I turned the previous devices on. But this baby comes in Loud &amp; Clear. All kinds of radio stations are at a touch of the dial for me now. I haven't even tried the record player yet (I didn't notice that it came as part of the package until I opened the box and saw the turntable.

<span>Update 3/20/21: It's been a few months and no problems. Works just like the day I got it.<br/><br/>--<br/><br/>Update: Nice! I got some really quick answers, including from the seller, about the one thing that I was unsure about. Short version-- the turntable itself will be a little loose when all set up; this is normal/ideal. I'm really pleased with this unit and the fast response I got. Thanks much!<br/><br/>I got this along with the three-year warranty, since reviews are indicating this product is fragile/prone to some issues. I only had one issue, which I'll detail toward the end of this review. I've asked a question relevant to that point, and will update my review to reflect what I hear back.<br/><br/>So first of all, the unit I received appeared intact/undamaged from what I can tell and looking at the packaging. The whole thing is wrapped in plastic and ships in a box that says what it is on the outside. It comes with RCA cables. The instruction manual says it ALSO includes a 3mm aux out cable, but I didn't see that inside-- just the RCA cables. I don't see anything else that confirms that the cable should be in there, so, I'm guessing it's just a mistake with the manual print rather than a missing item.<br/><br/>It probably doesn't need saying, but just in case, the lid does not open fully, but if you push the joint forward (toward you), it will lock open in place. You can close the lid without problems. It is open in the back to allow more space for records, so keep that in mind.<br/><br/>I checked the FM, phono (vinyl), CD, and bluetooth functions. All of these worked perfectly. Note that the turntable will not spin until and unless you move the needle arm over to the record. Also don't throw out the needle protector! The instructions mention to keep these, but if I hadn't read it and hadn't been thinking, I would've tossed it.<br/><br/>The CD has some limited programmability-- basically you can choose what order to play tracks in, on a disc. Nothing else really to mention on that function.<br/><br/>The bluetooth worked perfect. I've had some devices be annoying and finicky whether they want to be recognized, and this wasn't one of them.<br/><br/>Sound quality is all right-- if you're looking for something super loud with heavy bass, you'll want to plug in other speakers. I can't stand the "blow the dust off the speakers!" appeal, so this is fine for me. It does sound better when the unit is at least 8-10 feet away, sounds more balanced. For its size and for being an all-in-one, this is both acceptable and perfectly decent, no complaints. I'm used to listening from a pair of computer speakers when I don't have headphones on, so this is fine.<br/><br/>My one issue-- (Reminder: Got an answer and this is fine apparently!)<br/>The turntable comes with a screw which is unscrewed to help keep the unit safe during transportation. The instructions say to TIGHTEN this screw before playing. I've seen some reviewers who I am guessing are confused, since they've loosened it instead. I was able to tighten this screw pretty easily, but the issue I have is that the turntable itself is not REALLY secure from doing this. You can still move it maybe 8mm/a third of an inch or so, just... around. This includes the turntable AND the arm, which I would expect to be, you know, screwed and fixed in place, immobile. It is not either of these things-- and it moves if I need to adjust the speed or anything like that. Now, when the record's playing, it seems totally fine, and it does play the records fine, but I was taken aback by this. I'm waiting on an answer to find out how problematic this is. For now, it seems to be working fine, but it definitely gives me pause, so to speak.<br/><br/>So, that aside, I haven't had any OTHER problems, and I'm happy with it. If it turns out that's just normal, I can't say it seems like a sensible part of the design to me, but as long as it works, that's fine. Overall this is a very attractive, pleasant-sounding, versatile player. We'll see if it lasts-- I'll update this review periodically to reflect any problems that arise, or lack thereof.</span>

<span>These are exactly what I was looking for.  I had a air of old JBL surround speakers set up as the surround L/R in my home office.  They were just a little too big and heavy for the stands I had them on, and weren't suited for wall mounting.  I did a quick search for "small surround speakers" here on Amazon, and these came up.  They are a great size and a great price.  Surround or surround back channels are the perfect application for these.  The included wall mount brackets meant I could set them up behind the couch on the wall and wouldn't need to use stands.  They are barely noticeable now.  Just to try it out,  I hooked them up to as the main L/R on the 2-ch set up in the dining room.  They sound OK, but not unexpectedly these aren't well suited for that application.  And I don't think they are intended for that.  But they are great as surround speakers.</span>

<span>The previous owner had some jankily installed speaker wire ran up the wall to some rear speaker mounts.  Because of the way the wire was installed, I wasn't sure it was in good condition, so didn't want to spend a lot on upgrading from a 3.1 to a 5.1 setup if the speaker wire was junk in the first place.  I bought these solely on price and form factor.  My thought was that for the price, if it turned out that they weren't putting out the audio I wanted no big loss.  I'd have to consider redoing the wiring situation and go with nicer speakers, which would have been a chore both for placement and for the cable run.<br/><br/>Turns out, for my use case these are absolutely fantastic.  If they were for Center, Left or Right audio channels, I probably would want a nicer set of bookshelf speakers for fuller sound, but for wall mounted rear audio it fits the bill.  And with how cheap they are, I could absolutely see these being a whole house audio setup on the cheap as a starter set of speakers.<br/><br/>I've only just installed them, so no thoughts on durability and product longevity.  Installation was a breeze.  I saw one or 2 comments about how they mount's droop down.  You simply have to tighten the screw in the ball joint to increase resistance.  Mine stay where they are pointed after adjusting tension.</span>

<span>Tl;Dr Fun toy, but don't use for vintage vinyl.<br/><br/>I'm not here to flame anyone. This is a nice "baby's first" turntable for anyone who is curious about getting into vinyl. However, there are some serious caveats for your consideration, ESPECIALLY if you plan on listening to some vintage vinyl.<br/><br/>So I listened to two records on this turntable: An original pressing of The Who's 1973 masterpiece album, Quadrophenia, and a 2003 reissue of AC/DC's Powerage.<br/><br/>First up was Powerage, which played beautifully. The sound quality is not for people who use the term, "audiophile," to describe themselves. Nevertheless, the sound from the internal speakers are "serviceable" at best.<br/><br/>Next came Quadrophenia, and it was immediately problematic. I will point out that, being an old disc, there was some warping across the record, which caused it to wobble. What is worse, I noticed that the edge of the record was coming to rest from its up and down wobble onto the open lid of the record player, distorting the sound every other second, and slowing down the playback. This is a serious problem, as continued playback like this could damage the vinyl.<br/><br/>So why does this happen on Quadro but not Powerage? Some of it is the player, and some of this is the nature of vinyl through history. As mentioned earlier, Quadrophenia was released in 1973. In the 70s, vinyl was competing with new media such as 8-tracks. There were also energy crises in the 70s. You need oil to create vinyl. Therefore, as a cost cutting measure to keep up with demand, vinyl manufacturers began to make thinner cuts of records. Thinner vinyl is more susceptible to warping and "wobble" on the turntable.<br/><br/>My AC/DC album is a 2003 reissue, during the Renaissance of vinyl nostalgia. Technology is much better, so the album is much thicker, sturdier, and much less susceptible to warp, hence why it played beautifully.<br/><br/>Had the manufacturer been willing to create an inch worth of more clearance between th record and the lid of the player, that would have mitigated the problem somewhat, however there are other things at play that comes with the territory of the cheap nature of this player. First of all, of you want to play older vinyl, you definitely want a full platter (the platform on which the record sits). That helps mitigate (but not totally eliminate) the wobble, as the record is more supported. Higher end record players also have weights and balances to help keep the tonearm perfect pressed against the vinyl.<br/><br/>In conclusion, if you are curious to try vinyl, and you are playing with modern vinyl, and you don't want to shell out big bucks for an entry level turntable, by all means give it a try with tempered expectations. If you are listening to vintage vinyl, protect them by going higher end.<br/><br/>My recommendation for a perfect entry level turntable: Audio-Technica LP60XBT</span>

<span>You're looking at a pair of $16 speakers for a reason, right? Maybe you have a small room. Maybe you have a smaller budget. Maybe you want to try something out before committing to a larger investment. Maybe this is a component that complements you current audio setup. In any case, you're reading the reviews because you have one question in your head: Can a pair of $16 speakers possibly be any good?<br/><br/>The answer is yes. These little speakers perform remarkably well for the price. And in some cases, you may even be able to remove the caveat "for the price."<br/><br/>I bought these to upgrade my home office. Listening to music through my Amazon Basics computer speakers just wasn't the experience I wanted. But for the smallish room (maybe 12' by 12'), I also didn't need something that was going to blow me out the window. I already have two turntable setups, and I didn't want to invest in a third system. The price tag, as well as the quick shipping, sealed the deal for me.<br/><br/>I have them connected to a Pioneer receiver I had lying around after an upgrade a few years ago. I added a (very old) center speaker, mostly because why not? Honestly, these 3" speakers do most of the lifting. I was surprised by how loud they can be. And while you certainly wouldn't expect a lot of bass with these, they still hold their own. I listen to a lot of fuzzy, low-end riffs, and these speakers performed much better than my computer speakers.<br/><br/>I like that I can still keep these even if I upgrade my system. They're small an inexpensive enough to move to a garage or other exposed space. If you're like me, you have a box of old AV stuff somewhere (noteworthy - these don't come with speaker wire) - you can toss these speakers in and use them in your front yard for Halloween or give them to your niece when she goes off to college. The cost, size, and versatility mean you're not overcommitting yourself.<br/><br/>I'm in that narrow space where I'm not an audiophile, but I'm still picky about audio quality. These get the job done for me.</span>

<span>Most negative reviews mention that the speakers don't hook up to their TV and/or that they don't come with cables. Just in case you are confused - these are passive speakers, meaning they need an amplifier (aka a hi-fi or stereo system) to power them. You can't plug them directly into a TV. They are connected to the amplifier with speaker wire which you cut to length for your specific set up - Amazon Basics 16 gauge speaker wire should be just fine for these.<br/><br/>Now that we've gotten past that - these are great for what they are! I needed small speakers for my gaming setup with a PVM that only has one (mono) speaker. The price looked good and the size was what I needed, plus I have a Pyle phono pre-amp that works well and so I knew the brand was solid. I have these hooked up to an Aiyima A07 as the amp and I get crisp, clean, stereo sound. I would totally recommend these for a similar setup.</span>

<h2 style="text-align: center;">FAQS</h2>
<h3><h3>Can you plug speakers directly into a record player?</h3></h3>
    

Yes, you can plug speakers directly into a record player.
<h3><h3>Are powered speakers good for turntable?</h3></h3>
