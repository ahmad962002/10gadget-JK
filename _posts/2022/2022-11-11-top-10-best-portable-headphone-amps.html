<span>Paid for new and received used. Box and amp are scuffed up and the USB port for Data is broken, I can hear the center peace rattle inside when I shake it. Extremely disappointed :/ but it does sound AMAZING after I configured the settings and EQ to my liking.</span>

<span>It has ok sound. But it only has micro USB. I wasn't really wanting to go usb-c though a dongle to usb-a then cable to micro. It's a bit of a pain honestly. And it doesn't sound as good as the one that is -c. But that one has a switch to take it out of charge mode and if you forget it'll drain your battery real quick. I wasn't careful and thought this had 2 usb-c parts so that I didn't have to deal with tiny switches.<br/><br/>As for the EQ, I don't think it's doing anything. Not in manual nor any of the pre-sets. But I suppose that doesn't matter much when the out put isn't balanced. Just a normal 3.5mm..... I regret buying this one.</span>

<span>It’s like eating hostess cupcakes your entire life and then someone hands you a home made fresh out of the oven slice of Death by Chocolate cake.  The soundstage is fantastic, it pushes it out further and makes it more spherical.  I listened to an HD recording of Starwars on YouTube and I could pick out where the brass section was, the string section and flutes.  I’m listening to it plugged into my iPhone and Blue Tacked to the back of an extra case I have.  I’m using a pair of $50 CCA 12 earbuds and I can’t get over how great the soundstage and instrument separation is.<br/><br/>I also plug it into my tv through a coaxel  Cable plugged into an adaptor and then a 1/8 from that to the line in on the Monolith.  Non high def audio from the tv and Netflix sound good, but video games from my ps4 sound incredible.  It’s really easy when playing shooter to pinpoint where in the sound field a particular sound is coming from and react to it.  Playing Grand Turismo really makes me appreciate all the work they do to create realistic engine and wind sounds when playing the game.<br/><br/>The monoth has a screen on the back consisting of A shelf EQ, 3 parametric EQs and Dirac. The controls are a little clunky, but easy to get used to. The only big draw back is the volume knob which is easily adjustable and can turn up or down very easily which can lead to very loud music if you bump it too hard.  This is also my first Amp/DAC I’ve owned and have had it about a month before I wrote this review.  I’m givin it four stars because if the volume knob and because the first one broke, shorting out when I was charging it.</span>

<span>Don't waste your time, I had two units sent out. Get a Fiio BTR5 with balanced 2.5mm and you are set for 110 to 130 bucks. I just shipped these back, save your time and get a BTR5.<br/>Also comes with a charging cable and phone charger and thats it, I had to send all the USB wires back too. Not worth 300, but 150 this would be a good buy. Remember you have to buy your own cables. That was another 30 bucks so 330, way to expensive. Less power then BTR5 it almost does it then it clips.</span>

<span> I was looking for an extremely portable amp that would be easy to carry in my backpack or luggage. I found the Vox amPlugs and thought those would be perfect since they are extremely small and I could plug them into any portable speaker I wanted, and even use my headphones for silent practice sessions at night. I had settled on getting the AC30 amPlug since it had some nice clean sounds and Vox's AC30 amp is a classic amp that many classic rock players use, but I primarily play harder rock and metal which use dirtier tones, so I was trying to decide which of Vox's dirtier amPlug models I wanted in addition to the AC30. However, I had this device, the Valeton Rushead Max, recommended to me, and after listening to a few videos and seeing a great Black Friday deal on it, I decided to go with this. I am very glad I did.<br/><br/>The Pros:<br/>This is both very well built and extremely versatile. While I still don't have an AC30 amPlug (the clean sound on this is enough for me for now, though I will likely eventually get one and update this review when I do), I have read that they are somewhat flimsy. This pocket amp has no such issues and is very sturdily built. The sounds on this are also extremely versatile. Like most pocket amps and mini-amps, this has the basic volume, tone, and gain controls. However, the types of amps offered and the effects are where this pocket amp shines. Vox's amPlugs have only one amp per amPlug, but they give you three different channels (a green, orange, and red, and the sound gets increasingly dirtier the redder the color gets), but from what I have heard on YouTube, the channels on the amPlugs don't sound very different. On this Valeton pocket amp, they give you three different amps entirely. "CL" gives you a nice clean tone, "OD" gives you a hard rock-style overdrive, and "DIST" gives you heavy metal-style distortion, so you can switch between three of the most popular guitar styles all at, to quote AC/DC, a "Flick of the Switch". I mostly use the OD and DIST channels, and they both sound awesome. I also love being able to drastically switch sounds so easily, switching between the rock and metal tones I typically use all much quicker than dialing in the tones on my 20W Randall practice amp. Additionally, even mini-amps like the Nux or the Boss Katana only give you three similar options, so Valeton's pocket amp is on par with most mini-amps while being much smaller and letting you choose which speaker you want to use with it (when at home, I will typically grab the MOKCAO Power+, a speaker dock for the 2nd generation Echo Dots, which sounds surprisingly good for guitar and even rivals my larger 20W Randall practice amp, while on-the-go I will typically grab a little 808 NRG speaker, which doesn't sound as good but is significantly more portable). Lastly, this little device has a ton of available effects. Vox's amPlugs give you three different versions of Chorus, Delay, and Reverb, but you can only have one active at a time. Valeton's pocket amp lets you have Delay, Reverb, or Delay/Reverb active, and then you can add to that Chorus, Tremolo, or Flanger. It doesn't give you different versions, but you can change how each of them sound by adjusting a knob on the top of the device, ranging from not having any of the effect to having more of the effect.<br/><br/>The Cons (or Suggested Improvements):<br/>While there aren't any major negatives about this device, I do have a few suggested improvements. The biggest is that I would add bluetooth. I know this device already has a ton of stuff packed into a small package, but bluetooth typically doesn't take up much space. Also, many speakers in today's world only use bluetooth, so adding bluetooth would make this pocket amp work with more speakers as well as eliminating messy cords. If possible, I would also make this pocket amp slightly smaller – when attached to the lower bout on my Les Paul, the top comes very close to contacting the ground when I have the Les Paul sitting on the floor, and I sometimes worry that the amp might get broken. Additionally, making it slightly smaller would increase portability. Lastly, I do somewhat agree with another reviewer on here who mentioned that it is a bit difficult to use for guitars where the input jack is on the lower bout, since you can't see the buttons. While I have mostly gotten used to controlling the knobs and buttons by feel, I think what would be nice is making the jack on the amp rotatable. Unlike on Vox's amPlugs, though, which rotate the jack side-to-side, I think it would make more sense to let it rotate front and back, that way those who have input jacks on the front of the guitar can leave it facing downward while those who have it on the side can have the jack on the amp rotated so it is pointing out of the main face of the pocket amp, making it easier to see.<br/><br/>Overall, the cons aren't hugely significant, and the pros make this one of the best pocket amps you can buy, especially if you are interested in versatility. If you know you want an excellent recreation of exactly one of Vox's amps, then one of the amPlugs might be better for you, but if you want something that will give you a plethora of different sounds on-the-go, then this is the pocket amp for you. The tones, particularly the overdrive and distortion tones, also sound excellent, so you are getting amazing tones (especially if you have a good speaker) in addition to superb versatility. I am blown away how Valeton, a company I never heard of until I found this device, managed to make a significantly better pocket amp than Vox, one of the world's leading manufacturers of guitar amps. The Rushead Max even lets you just charge the device by plugging a micro-USB phone cord into it, which is much more convenient than using batteries with Vox's amPlugs (even if you use rechargeable batteries, you still have to take them out and charge them, while the Rushead Max you can just plug in - it claims it only lasts 5 hours, but I think it lasts a bit more than that, since I have gone 2-4 days with hour-ish long practice sessions and I have only had it go down to 1/4 the battery dots left without charging). I still plan to eventually get Vox's AC30 amPlug, since the AC30 is such a classic amp, and when I do I will update this review to provide a more thorough comparison between the amPlug and this. Until I do, though, I think Valeton has put Vox to shame in the pocket amp department, and I highly and enthusiastically recommend the Valeton Rushead Max!<br/><br/>Updated March 14, 2020: As I said in the review, the little 808 speaker I was plugging this Valeton Rushead Max into sounded quite tinny while the MOKCAO Echo Dot base sounded really good. I was researching speakers the last few months to try to find if there was a smaller speaker than the MOKCAO that sounded significantly better than the 808 speaker, and I settled on getting the Vanzom Climber-Z speaker. It is about halfway between the 808 and the MOKCAO speaker in size, and it sounds much more like the MOKCAO speaker, possibly even sounding slightly better than the MOKCAO. Those are the only three speakers I have tried with this and out of those three I would recommend the Vanzom Climber-Z speaker - it is $60 new but there are frequently 20-25% off coupons on it, which brings the cost to less than $50 new. I did listen to a few speakers at Best Buy recently, and though I couldn't compare the sound directly since I couldn't bring the Vanzom speaker inside, I thought the Vanzom was clearly better than all of the UE speakers and all of the Sony speakers except for the XB41 (which was much more expensive and larger), and I thought the Charge 4 was only slightly bassier than the Vanzom (though also larger and more expensive) and the Bose Soundlink Revolve was only slightly clearer than the Vanzom (though also considerably more expensive). So, assuming that how music sounds through speakers is a good indication of how a speaker will work with this pocket amp, there are speakers that may sound better than the Vanzom, but for its size and price, I think the Vanzom is the best deal. I would definitely recommend the Vanzom Climber-Z if you want to play this through a portable speaker, or at least a speaker with 2 or more active drivers and 1 or more passive radiators should create a fuller sound which will make playing this through the speaker sound better.<br/><br/>Update January 1, 2021: A few months ago I finally got a Vox AC30 AmPlug, and I also replaced my main amp with a Marshall Code 50. First comparing the AC30 AmPlug to the Rushead Max, I found my previous thoughts based on YouTube videos to be pretty accurate. The Rushead Max in general sounds better, is more versatile, is more convenient with a rechargeable battery, and is sturdier. The two plusses I found to the AC30 AmPlug is that the foldable plug does make it slightly more portable when transporting it, and I prefer the slightly crunchy clean tones of the AC30 AmPlug versus the crystal clean, and to me almost bland, clean tone of the Rushead Max. After learning more about amp models, I would guess the Rushead Max's clean channel is based on a Fender amp, the overdrive channel on the Marshall JCM800, and the distortion channel on the Mesa/Boogie. Therefore, I did compare the Rushead Max's distortion channel to the JCM800 model on my Marshall Code 50, and I was surprised with how close it came. The Code 50 clearly had more details and intricacies in the JCM800 sound, but it also has a much larger computer and a 12" speaker. Considering how small the Rushead Max and Vanzom speaker are, the Rushead Max did a good job getting the general tone of the JCM800 down. Secondly, in addition to the new amps, I have more recently tried two smaller speakers with the Rushead Max, in an attempt to make it more portable. The first one I tried was a cheap, off-brand aux speaker, which is essentially just a very small speaker with a male aux jack attached, designed for use with phones to make them louder. It made the Rushead Max a bit heavy, but I found putting a rubber band around the amp/speaker connection and strapping it around a tone or volume knob kept it in place. It sounded better than I would have expected from such a small speaker, but it was still very tinny and muddy and had no bass. Also, playing the overdrive or distortion channel with high volume made it shake, and I'm sure the speaker could easily be broken if played on high volumes on the distortion channel for long periods of time. The second speaker I got even more recently was a JBL Clip 3. I found that the best way to make it portable is to hang the Clip 3 off of one of the top tuners and run a 3-4 foot audio cable from the Rushead Max to the Clip 3. The Clip 3 still lacked the bass of the Vanzom speaker, sounded a bit tinny, and did the weird buzzing thing, but it was a considerable improvement over the phone extension speaker. In comparison to that one, the Clip 3 was significantly clearer, does not shake at higher volumes on the distortion channel like it is going to fall apart, and also has a bit more bass to it. So while if you want the best sound with the Rushead Max I would still recommend a tabletop portable speaker, if you are looking for a super portable way to use the Rushead Max which would allow you to walk freely around the room, I would recommend the JBL Clip 3 hung over a top tuning peg. I did also try connecting an Aluratek Bluetooth 5.0 transmitter/receiver to the Rushead Max so it could wirelessly connect to my Vanzom speaker (which also uses Bluetooth 5.0), but I found the lag, while only being ~0.5 seconds, to be quite noticeable, so I would recommend a wired connection for this pocket amp. Lastly, I have attached a couple more pictures of the Valeton Rushead Max, this time comparing it to the Vox AC30 AmPlug, as well as a video comparing sound samples between the Rushead Max and AC30 AmPlug. The distortion tones were achieved on the Rushead Max by changing channels while the distortion tones were achieved on the AC30 AmPlug by increasing the gain.<br/><br/>Updated September 26, 2021:<br/>I purchased a Diezel Herbert and an Alexander Jubilee Overdrive pedal a few months ago and was looking for an easy way to listen to them with headphones. Setting the Valeton to the clean mode and plugging into the output sort of worked but didn't sound the best, so I recently tried out a Boss Pocket GT, a Fender Mustang Micro, and a LEKATO Headphone Amp. The LEKATO was neat with cab sims and made the pedals sound the best when I only used a cab sim, but a clean setting on the Mustang Micro sounded pretty close just a little looser, and the amp models on the Fender were better even than the models on this Valeton headphone amp. I especially liked the Uber model on the Fender, which to my ears sounded fairly similar to the Diezel Herbert (my favorite of the two pedals). The Valeton sounds noticeably fizzier than the Mustang Micro, and the Mustang Micro is more compact and portable than the Valeton without being fragile like the Vox. The Mustang Micro also has more options. Though the Valeton does have a bit finer control over the options available, the knobs aren't super sensitive and after playing the Mustang Micro I realized the tone knob on the Valeton is slightly weird in that the volume decreases as you turn the tone down. Apparently one can also record with the Mustang Micro. I haven't tried it yet, but since this is the one I decided to keep out of the three new ones I tried, I definitely will try this at some point. Overall, I would recommend the Mustang Micro slightly more than the Valeton for its better tone, more compact size, and recording ability. However, the Mustang Micro is 3-4 times the price of the Valeton. I think it is worth it myself, but if you are on a budget and especially if you don't need to record, the Valeton is still the best headphone amp under $50 in my opinion. If you can find an extra $50 for a used Mustang Micro or a new one on sale, then I would recommend the Mustang Micro, though. I also added a couple more comparison pictures.</span>

Offering the easiest way to enjoy true analog amplifier sound in your headphones, the amPlug series has been a bestseller since it first appeared in 2007. With amPlug G2, the crucial analog circuit has been drastically improved, and each model now provides three modes. Guitar types provide multi-effect functionality, and a rhythm function has been added to the bass type. A foldable plug mechanism that rotates 180 degrees and an auto power-off function are additional features that contribute significantly to improved convenience and ease of use. The amPlug is the simplest way to get serious sound; occupying virtually no space, it's an ideal choice for any guitarist or bassist.

<span>I'm planning on buying a bass soon and wanted a cheap amp I could use just to practice. I have the AC30 and metal versions for my guitar and I love them, so buying this one for a bass was a no brainer.<br/><br/>I tested it on my seven string, and I can say the sound is great, being a small battery powered amp.<br/><br/>I can tell you from my experience with the other two amplugs that you can't beat this little device if you need to jam without disturbing others. And it's portability means you wouldn't have to lug around your amp from room to room. Definitely a welcome addition to any musician's practice gear.</span>

<span>Much better than the 3x more expensive Fxxder micro amp that I had returned.  Unlike the Fxxder micro, when this VOX is connected, no or not much electric circuit static sound (not sure the proper term) coming to my headphone.  I guess somehow VOX figured out a better way to shield the wires or the electric board causing the deeeee, hummm, noise...  or could be the rechargeable battery inside the Fxxder micro causing the noise, not an engineer, I don't know for sure.</span>

<span>The product itself is amazing, I use it everyday and it's really easy to get the hang of the tone and volume controls.<br/>My only issue is that the material of the mini amp is made of slightly cheap plastic, which is easily breakable and the plastic joints on the plug were coming undone, opening on the sides, making it easy to break from there, so if you don't have tape or glue it can be really dangerous to leave it like that, potentially allowing inside parts to spill out.</span>

<span>This is my first mobile DAC, so I am not the one able to adequately judge the sound quality. For me with my Hifiman Sundara it sounds excellent, better than the Schiit Hel 2 I have on my desktop. The reason why I wanted to write this review is because it was difficult for me to understand how this would work with an iPhone, and what kind of additional cables I might need. To be clear, several reviews here are misleading in this regard or outright not correct. Whether this is a version issue, I am not sure, but for me the connection was completely straight forward and as follows:<br/>First, the nook in the device perfectly fits the standard Apple Lightning to USB Camera adapter. While there is no fitting cable included, this is really the only additional cable you need to connect the device to your iPhone with Lightning.<br/>The second additional cable is a balanced headphone cable that connects to your headphones. Which one will depend on your headphones, but on the DAC side you will want a 4.4mm balanced connector. This is optional, but I highly recommend it.<br/>So, if you go from scratch with your iPhone you should get the hip dac2, an Apple Lightning to USB camera adapter and optionally a balanced headphone cable, and that's all you need.<br/><br/>So, would I buy it again? Probably not, because having listened with this for quite some time, while all is excellent, I probably would opt for a device with additional Bluetooth functionality. The short connection between iPhone and DAC works well when you are sitting on a desk, but when you are on the go etc, this becomes quite clunky and inconvenient. It would be nice to leave the whole headphone+DAC wherever it is, while conveniently using your iPhone by itself to select music.</span>

<span class="cr-original-review-content">Adquirí este DAC/AMP luego de mucho revisar y comparar entre este y otros de similar calidad / precio, sin embargo creo que por sus prestaciones, versatilidad y calidad, la elección era obvia.<br/><br/>Su sonido, sin ser analítico, revela y controla muy bien, aun cuando en algunos casos puede considerarse cálido, sin embargo no produce estridencias ni superposiciones contundentes que arruinen tu escucha; perdona en algo las grabaciones mal hechas y de cierta forma "ayuda".<br/><br/>Para tamaño y prestaciones es perfectamente capaz de mover fácilmente un sinnúmero de auriculares IEM y overear, gracias a un posiblidad de generar mayor ganancia con solo apretar un botón, obviamente no pretendas que mueva con facilidad cosas de 300Ohms o arriba, pero tampoco se queda varado.<br/><br/>Su terminación es muy buena, su combinación de materiales con una carcaza de aluminio color naranja ocre texturizado, botones en color grafito anodizado y las áreas de conectores en negro mate con acentos dorados para la conexión de salida balanceada 4.4mm y USB audio, generan una sensación premium en mano muy destacada.<br/><br/>La duración de su batería es excelente y su carga es relativamente rápida en comparación.  Debo aclarar que nunca llegué a pasar del 50% de ganancia de volumen por ser insoportable.<br/><br/>El factor extra bass podría ser apreciable para algunos, sin embargo NO ES PARA NADA enfocado a los BASSHEADS, no se cómo lo hacen pero aporta la cantidad justa de graves y en especial de sub graves con un muy buen control, quizás útil para ciertos géneros específicos (hip hop, techno) para ocasiones en las que quieras irte un poco a que te vibre la cabeza y el cuerpo, pero no es realmente obligatorio y debo confesarlo, soy amante de los buenos y profundos sub graves.<br/><br/>Las voces e instrumentos en el rango medio suenan increíblemente bien para el tamaño de este aparato, muy claros, muy "redondeados" sin perder la naturalidad y de cierta manera la precisión.<br/><br/>En la parte de los altos debo confesar que tienen una extensión bastante buena, controlan bien esas "s" o "sh" de ciertas voces o instrumentos, pero sin perder el "cuerpo", hay casos, sin embargo en que le es complejo dar mayor profundidad a la escena, obviamente también debe mirarse con cuales auriculares lo pruebas, pero en cuanto a la imagen de escena sonora, este aparto es una belleza.<br/><br/> Los únicos contras quizas serían. 1. Que la funda de protección de iFi no venga incluída en el paquete; 2. Que no traiga bluetooth, esto es entendible porque para eso está el iFi GO Blu que es una bestia de la portabilidad y HipDac V2 está mas orientado a entornos "desktop travel", no tanto a ultraportabilidad y 3. Que los cables de audio, para ser mas estéticos, no viniesen por ejemplo, como los cables trenzados de los IEMs, eso sería una joya.</span><span class="cr-translated-review-content aok-hidden"></span>

<span>I bought the DragonFly Black about a year ago for my mobile music production setup, as I wanted a high quality portable DAC for my mobile music-making setup. It outputs a very strong signal, and it gives a lot of power to my mixing headphones and portable monitors.<br/><br/>HOWEVER, I've started noticing that the onboard DSP on this DAC will sometimes do what appears to be very aggressive peak limiting on the signal. I started noticing this when I was doing some drum sound design. Transients would sound muffled or they wouldn't even appear at all sometimes (pure impulses don't seem to want to come through). I A/B'd this with other usb DACs I had lying around, and confirmed that the issue was indeed confined to the device.<br/><br/>I recorded the output of the DAC back into the system, and sure enough, the output waveform confirmed what I was hearing: the transient of my test signal was smashed by some process and then replaced with a fade-in attack, an instantly recognizable signature of some kind of compressor. I've attached the before and after photos.<br/><br/>Furthermore, what is interesting is that the peak limiter will only kick on with peaks that are spaced far enough apart by relative silence. It seems to be that a peak from silence will "wake up" the limiter, and then take a few seconds of silence to go back to sleep.<br/><br/>This peak limiting behavior is persistent on mid-2015 macbook pro, an m1 apple air, as well as a computer running Alpine Linux, so it safe to say that this is a firmware related problem. I also bought and tested the DragonFly Red, and it also applied the same peak limiting on my test signal.<br/><br/>So far, I've only encountered this issue in music production related tasks, such as previewing drum samples and other short audio files. For more long-term music listening, this doesn't seem to happen.<br/><br/>I've been trying to communicate with Tech support about this over the last few weeks, but so far it has been a slow and unhelpful process.</span>

<span>What’s Old is New Again.<br/><br/>All the reviews out there in the blogosphere/vlogosphere that tout the Dragonfly Cobalt and its ability to enhance your listening experience are overwhelmingly positive, so you can certainly look up any of those reviews from an expert’s point-of-view.  But from an Average Guy’s view (like me), I can definitely hear the difference when using this device.<br/><br/>I tend to listen to music in my car more so than any other place.  And, for that, I usually stream music via my phone (Amazon Music HD) through the car’s AUX port.  I have been doing this by simply taking a high quality 3.5mm audio stereo cable with two male heads and plugging one head into the AUX port and the other into the phone’s headphone jack.  I own an LG G8 Thinq (the last flagship phone LG made in 2019 prior to exiting the smartphone segment; and this phone features that rare headphone 3.5mm headphone jack).  Back then (and even today in late 2021), that in-phone DAC was generally regarded as the best by quite a margin (the phone’s max sample rate output is 24-bit / 48 KHz).<br/><br/>Meanwhile, I own a 2014 BMW 3 Series and I have done lots to improve its musical components.  I’ve upgraded my amplifier (Up7BMW) and all speakers/A-Pillar tweeters (FOCAL brand).  And, I purchased an Equalizer app on the Google Play Store.  Still, wanting higher fidelity, I then purchased the Dragonfly Cobalt DAC.<br/><br/>Immediately, even with all of the upgrades that I’ve invested into my car’s sound system, I could hear a musical boost.  And when I play my favorite songs, old and new, the enhanced fidelity peels back all of these musical elements that I had never really noticed before (a more pronounced drum beat; the sliding of the fingers along the neck of a guitar; the raw emotion of a singer’s voice; better defined strumming from a generally-hard-to-notice acoustical guitar, etc… - what audiophiles would describe as neutrality).  I’ve read various articles stating that listening to your radio does sound muddy, which it does.  You can (and I can) hear a difference when playing a CD.  But, adding a good DAC takes it up one notch further, and you feel like you’re right there in the front row of a concert or at the recording studio itself.<br/><br/>Now, your listening experience may differ because not everyone “hears” the same or perhaps as well.  So, if seeing a number helps you to visualize improvement (although “seeing-is-believing” is different than “hearing-is-believing” in this case), here’s what I’m seeing with my LG G8 ThinQ.  Without the Cobalt, the phone’s DAC can stream music at up to a sample rate of 24-bit / 48 khz, which is pretty good.  I know this because with Amazon Music HD, you can press the music quality “badge” to bring up this kind of info.  Now, with the Cobalt plugged in, the output increases to 24-bit / 96 khz.  I’ve read that the max output, though, would be 24-bit / 192 khz, so let’s quickly talk about that pinnacle of sound quality for a second.  The only way of possibly getting there from my readings (and I’m sure there are other ways that I haven’t discovered yet) is by subscribing to Tidal’s HiFi Plus Tier (which is their top tier) AND also downloading onto your phone an app called USB Audio Player Pro (also known as UAPP).  Somehow – and I profess my ignorance on this as I’m not a sound engineer – this app plus the Dragonfly Cobalt plus its ability to play well with Tidal (the technical term sound engineers use is “unfolding”) allows access to that 24-bit / 192 khz musical experience<br/><br/>Anyway, as you’ll already know, the Dragonfly has this helpful light that defines the quality of the music you’re hearing.  Unfortunately though, unless you’re paying $240 a year for Tidal’s top hi-res tier, that light then also gives you a sense of FOMO.  I pay $80 a year for Amazon Music HD (as I am already an Amazon Prime member).  Now, for just $80 a year and despite not being able to reach that 24-bit / 192 Khz threshold, I can still attain musical nirvana.  So, Amazon Music HD is totally worth it.  And the Dragonfly Cobalt, IMHO, is totally worth it too.<br/><br/>But, as with all things subjective (like hearing), your mileage may vary.  Will this be worth it to you?  In this case, there are four things that you’ll want to consider<br/>A) Can you hear the difference?  Again, some of us have better hearing than others.  If you can’t hear much the difference between music over the radio and music on a CD, then you probably won’t hear much of a sonic upgrade here.<br/>B) How many hours a day will you use this?  That is, why purchase a pricey doodad if you’re only going to use it now and then?  It’s kind of the same in-your-head argument when you think about joining a gym or subscribing to Disney+.<br/>C) Think about your music source.  The idea of a DAC is to allow it to further “unwrap” the audio file to allow for that richer listening music (again, using that term “neutrality”).  But, if you’re listening and happy with Spotify Free or any other lossy music tier (usually the free ones with possible ads), those files won’t have much to reveal anyway.  The entry point at which to consider whether to invest in a DAC or not is when you are subscribing to a hi-res music service (i.e.: Quboz; Amazon Prime HD; Tidal Hi-Fi; etc…).<br/>D) Finally, think about the equipment that will be outputting your sound (e.g. earphones, earbuds, speaker systems).  If they are of low quality, then a DAC probably won’t do much. And keep in mind that this DAC would also probably cost MORE than most run-of-the-mill earphones, earbuds, speakers).<br/><br/>Oh, I do want to bring up one thing if you subscribe to Amazon Music HD.  I saw on their FAQ page that Amazon Music HD is not always reliable in giving max audio quality if it doesn't sense a super-fast internet connection (or maybe if a lot of subscribers are trying to stream hi-res music at the same time – let’s call it ‘congestion’), so I’ve seen the light turn both powder blue (denoting a bitstream of 96 KHz) as well as cobalt blue (denoting a bitstream 48 KHz for the same song during different times of the day, but never below that number if you’ve set songs to play at HD or better quality).  In fact, on its FAQ page, it does say, “For streaming, the current source file quality may change due to varying network conditions.”  So, if you’re subscribing to Amazon Music HD and see this happening, it’s not the Cobalt malfunctioning.<br/><br/>Finally … here’s a question you’ll want to ask yourself and a suggestion.  Have you looked at the THX Onyx?  It is also a very well-regarded DAC and probably a 2nd place runner-up if you read the various reviews out there about DACs (with the Cobalt being the consensus winner when talking about power/portability).  However, at the time of this writing, the Onyx is currently on sale for $150 (down from about $200, and can be found here on Amazon or on Razer.com).  Hmmm…  $150 for the Onyx vs $330 for the Cobalt?  That does make the Cobalt a tougher sell, actually.<br/><br/>Again, the only real downer here is the price.  $330 seems pricey, even though it’s a svelte yet powerful top-of-the-line product.<br/><br/>If you are willing to consider really good dongle DACs with perhaps less of a svelte/compact form factor that cost just half as much, you may also want to check out these very worthy alternatives, also found here on Amazon.<br/>- THX Onyx, $150<br/>- Helm Bolt DAC, $150<br/>- Astell &amp; Kern USB-C Dual DAC Cable, $100<br/><br/>In the end, the Dragonfly Cobalt is a 5-star product (although I’m not convinced that it’s $150 better than the THX).  I’m very happy with this product. If you tend to listen to music quite a bit to complement your day, then investing in a really good DAC like the Dragonfly Cobalt makes for a solid purchase decision.<br/><br/>Good luck on finding what suits you best.</span>

<span>Excellent dac/amp for on the go listening.<br/><br/>I've always been intrigued by the dragonfly (df), but because the old model (df 1.2) didn't play well with mobile devices, so I always passed. well the new df black and red play really nice with mobile devices. I'm an android user, and using the black couldn't be easier. grab an otg cable, plug in, and go. I have an lg g4 running android 6.00, and I had absolutely no issues getting my df to work.<br/><br/>unsure of the sonic differences between the black and red, I purchased both to test. I kept the black. for my on the go headphones, my ath msr7, the extra power of the red wasn't necessary. and other than volume, I noticed no difference in sound quality.<br/><br/>ok so how does the black sound? very good! the lg g4 has a horrible audio section. the dac is muddy and indistinct, and the amp is feeble. switching from the headphone jack to the black was like an awakening for my headphones. they were loud, clear, and dynamic. the msr7 sounded very alive, very visceral plugged into the black. the soundstage expanded, bass tightened and deepened, and highs lost their shrillness. I was quite happy with the difference between the headphone jack and the black.<br/><br/>I also tried my wife's iphone 6s with the black and red. the iphone's audio section is vastly superior to my lg g4, so I thought this would be a good test for them. to my surprise, they were still superior to the phone's headphone jack, though the differences weren't quite as drastic as with my lg g4 (curse you lg, for making such a great phone with such a horrific audio section!!!!!!). the black was still more detailed than the iphone, transmitting micro detail that the iphone struggled with. bass was more full, and highs were not as bright/shrill as the iphone. all in all it was just a more refined and pleasing sound. I will give credit to apple though, their stock audio section is very good overall.<br/><br/>I also tried plugging in my power hog planar magnetic headphones, the alpha prime and mad dog pro. unfortunately neither the red nor the black had enough power to wake them up. but that's to be expected, those are very difficult headphones to drive properly.<br/><br/>I further tested the black against my desktop odac+02 amp. I plugged my phone via an otg cable into both sets and volume matched to 85db to try to eliminate volume bias. mind you this was not a scientific comparison, just my best shot at trying to keep the playing field level.<br/><br/>the odac is my go to reference for neutrality. it's about as neutral sounding as I've heard. any coloration you hear is coming from either the player or headphones. the black is not quite neutral. it's a tad warmer sounding than the odac, and not quite as refined. there is a slight shrillness in the upper ranges that come out on the black when directly compared to the odac. that being said, the black was still very very very clear sounding, just ever so slightly less detailed and refined. the odac with the o2 amp has much more brawn than the black, and that did translate to improved dynamics. at the same volume, bass was even tighter and more full. highs extended more but with less shrillness. and vocals were more bodied and textured. though the msr7 doesn't need much power, it was clear it could use a bit more than the black/red was providing.<br/><br/>don't take the odac comparison as an indictment of the black. no, quite the opposite, it highlights how wonderful such a small, portable device can sound compared to a wall powered desktop system. sure the odac+o2 was better, but only SLIGHTLY. granted with harder to drive headphones, the black would begin to struggle quicker than the odac would. but that's to be expected.<br/><br/>so in short, the dragonfly black (and red) is an excellent product that delivers excellent sound and ease of use. in my opinion, this is a must have for mobile users.</span>

<span>Apple SE (2nd Generation)<br/>TIDAL Master Streaming Subscription<br/>Audio Quest Dragonfly Cobalt<br/>7Hz Timeless IEM<br/>= Lovely<br/><br/>Why: I grew tired of a sketchy Bluetooth connection while walking my hounds around the park. The only way I could mostly solve the problem was to listen to downloaded music with WiFi and Cellular turned off.<br/><br/>Experience: I was able to enjoy my favourite artists without distraction. The sound was smooth, clean, and dependable. There is a bit of getting ready to go with the wires, but the Dragonfly is small and tidy, and I appreciate that. I also smile inside at that purple MQA Dragonfly light, even though I can't tell the difference in sound quality between Master and HiFi. I have better things to do than try to chase that debate. I'm human and adaptable to multiple levels of excellence.<br/><br/>Shout Outs:<br/>I bought the Dragonfly Cobalt through Amazon but called Listen Up in Colorado to ask questions and judge their service level. The man who helped me was a good listener and confident that the Dragonfly Cobalt was the top choice for my requirement. I liked his strong recommendation, so I chose to buy from Listen Up when I made my Amazon purchase.<br/><br/>Thank you to the Directors Garage, the excellent YouTube channel that recommended the 7hz Timeless IEM headphones. They fit my ears straight out of the box with complete comfort.<br/><br/>Apple: I'm a long-time Apple customer. If you mimic my setup, remember to buy the Lightning to USB3 Camera adapter.

<span>Just a heads up, I’ve only had this for a week but since there isn’t that many reviews I figured this one might provide a little more info.<br/><br/>Headphones used were Mr. Speakers Open Alphas and Audeze LCD-XC.<br/><br/>Size, portability and looks:  it’s about the size of a cigarette pack but substantially thinner.  Of the top of my head it’s about the thickness of the tip of my pointer finger or a little thicker than an iPhone XR and I’m guessing most modern phones. It’s extremely lightweight and if you plan on using it with any modern smart phone, it’s definitely small enough to stack it with your phone and slide em both in your pocket ( I forget what they’re called but I found these rubber type webbings that attaches to the corners of your phone and any amp/dacs are held in place by the webbing in the back of your phon  so no rubber bands across your screen. Definitely recommend. I think I searched “silicone rubber bands for phones” or something similar on Amazon). It got a cool blueish/greenish ocean teal type color with a pretty cool gold/brass knob that is used to turn on the amp/dac as well as control the volume.<br/><br/>Features:  it’s pretty much got whatever you need when your in the go or need something portable.  It’s dsd/pcm numbers are pretty awesome for something of this size plus mqa unfolding if your using tidal.<br/>It has a power match (gain stage?) button next to the bass boost button to the left of the gold knob in the front. I kept the power match button on while using the headphones and there was plenty of power to drive both cans (using the 4.4mm input) easily.<br/><br/>Sound:  like I said, it’s only been a week or so since I’ve been using this so these are basic impressions not a full blown review.<br/><br/>Open alphas plugged straight into an iPhone sounded really dark and congested. Plugged into the hipdac they sound incredible. Darkness was lifted and the congestiveness were both gone. The sound stage, depth, separation and overall sound quality were greatly improved. It was actually pretty surprising to me just how much of a difference the SQ was improved. So far I haven’t heard any noticeable hissing or pops or any other weirdness. I kept the bass boost off using the alphas as the hipdac (using power match button) seemed to be pushing these enough to get that bassy, punchy sound from the alphas( I’m guessing probably other fostex tr type cans would work well with this little guy too)<br/><br/>I haven’t used it with the LCD-XCs enough to give any insight other than that the hipdac will push em.<br/><br/>I have an old Oppo ha-2 portable amp/dac that I’ve been using for years as my go to portable. It’s a great amp/dac but I’m pretty sure the hipdac will take its place. From the features, the power, sound, size and portability its a pretty amazing little piece of hardware for a very reasonable price.<br/><br/>If your looking for a portable amp/dac I would definitely keep the hipdac on the list to consider.</span>

<span>Sound quality using Tidal both HiFi and Master is outstanding.  Amplification and bass both spot on.  I have done air travel with it several times.  Battery life in the 4-6 hour range.  A bit clunky with the iPhone connection but maneuverable.  Need the connecter  that iPhone uses for cameras which adds extra cabling. The volume control/power switch is where I would love to see an upgrade.  Volume control very sensitive, so if you have in the seatback small movements can change volume dramatically.  Also, no automatic power off so if you leave the volume/power on you will lose your battery.  WIll not charge your iphone while using which probably makes sense for DAC battery conservation.</span>

<span>I love this little gem! It works well with both my iPhone 12 Pro Max and my iPad Pro 2019 version. Bought the Apple CCK to lightning and the ifi USB -C connector to female USB-A connector at the same time as I bought the hipdac. The connections are quite secure on both and the sound is absolutely top notch. I have used and tested Tidal, Qobuz, Amazon HD, and Apple Music. All worked wonderfully with the appropriate colors showing up on either side of the ifi hipdac’s volume which is wonderful to the touch. Two caveats, The volume knob can be quite sensitive, especially in a pocket. I use a hair tie to hold the hipdac to the back of my iPhone case and this seems to eliminate the issue but just be forewarned. The other is there is only a slight difference between the color Green which covers PCM up to 24/96, and Yellow which is PCM 24/192 and above. Just a very small difference and if you try you can see a slight dimming which I suppose is Yellow.  MQA does light  up Magenta as it should.<br/><br/>More about the sound. I’ve used three headphones with the hipdac so far; Oppo PM-3, Beyer Dt-990 Pro (250 ohms), and my favorites, the small $75 emu purpleheart wood cans from Drop. I have a balanced 4.4 mm cable on the way to use with my reference open back Senn HD600s, I’ll update on that later. First of all this little jewel has a lot of power. It drove the Beyers to insane levels, albeit with the high gain switch deployed. And it was quite a joy to utilize the bass boost as well, but only on certain songs as it could bloat quickly if there was too much bass in the original mix. But useful nonetheless. With the Oppos I had to use the ifi ematch+, which I already had on hand, to get the best results. High gain and occasionally the bass boost, helped me really enjoy the PM-3s a great deal and at the moment this is my favorite pairing while stationary. But I move around the house a good deal and here is where the little emus are outstanding. For the last 4 years, though I own too many headphones, I have relied on the emus and two LG V20s, in airplane mode with WiFi reengaged, running UAPP to play music from Tidal and Qobuz. Alas, my V20s both started to reboot quite regularly whilst playing music. As they are both four years old and T-Mobile hasn’t updated Android in over two years, I finally gave up the ghost.  Sooo, I had to resort to my iPhone for mobility. Hence the purchase of the hipdac. Sometimes things really do seem to work out. On low gain at about half volume the sound from the emus is outstanding! I never knew the emus could be so detailed. Highs and lows sound far better than I would imagine from past experience. Anyways, I am one happy camper these days. And the hipdac even makes lossy music sound good. I use the Live Music app to access the Grateful Dead’s concerts and more from Archive.org. Listening to Matrix recordings the music does not sound compressed at all. Frankly I am stunned at the quality. I have over 2 TBs of legally downloaded music that I have accumulated over the last twenty years but who wants to pay the premium for larger storage on a new iPad when this DAC/amp streaming from the iPhone sounds just as good as the 24/96 downloaded files playing through the Onkyo HiFi player even as good as that app is. Sound in one word, impeccable!<br/><br/>I’ve seen some folks complain about battery life, but I have not any issue with the hipdac in this respect. Now I’m not trying to play music for 8 hours at a time, though I respect those who try to do so during a full work day. I usually max out at 3 hours, then place the hipdac in standby, and come back for another 2-3 hours later on, and then finally another 1-2 hours before bedtime. So 6-8 hours of usage a day with roughly 2 standby periods in between, and I’ve never seen anything but green on the battery indicator at the rear of the unit. It takes about 2 and a half hours to charge to white and then for the light to turn off.<br/><br/>In summary, this little hipdac floats my boat. As someone who plays in both the shallow end and the deep end in the pool of headphones I couldn’t be any happier. I have tried other dongles that did okay including one that did MQA. But this piece of kit is a home run IMHO! Highly recommended!<br/><br/>UPDATE: 7/10<br/><br/>Received balanced cables to use with Senn HD 600s and Meze 99 Classics. The Sennheiser cable upgraded the 600s to the point of quite enjoyable listening on the go. For well recorded music in Hi-Rez this is a wonderful pairing and let’s the HipDac really shine.<br/><br/>It was the Meze cable that turned my world upside down. I’ve always liked the 99 Classics but would more than occasionally find them bloated on the low end. Not any more! Using Meze’s own balanced cable with the HipDac took the 99s to levels of incredible clarity with deep taut bass that I wouldn’t have imagined from past use. Love, love, love this combo with both the iPhone 12 Pro Max and the iPad Pro 2019 version. As the Meze’s I have are beautiful to look at, as well as touch, having their sound elevated to beyond reference level is a blessing. With the Meze 99 Classics, HipDac , balanced cable, and USB connector, you’ll spend around $700. But if you want beautiful music from your phone or tablet, this combo will keep a smile on your face!</span>

<span>I use the HP4 for home studio use to allow myself and the performer(s) to monitor with ease, and it's great!<br/><br/>I originally had the Behringer MicroAmp HA400. First of all, don't buy that. The power supply chirps VERY loudly, and the sound quality is eh. Put that $25 towards something like this instead.<br/><br/>Presonus makes quality stuff at a great price point for those still pretty early on in their gear collecting journey (such as myself). The HP4 looks nice, has a small footprint, sounds good, and most importantly is versatile and does its job perfectly.<br/><br/>This thing actually solved several of my problems:<br/>-I had that stupid chirping HA400 that just needed to go asap.<br/>-I have a hardware issue on my Focusrite interface involving both of the headphone jacks, so I needed something that would accept L/R input and allow me to run from the Scarlett's monitor outs instead until I can get that fixed.<br/>-The power adapter is along the cord, rather than having a brick plug, which is SUPER helpful when it comes to tight real estate on the power strip. (Fewer bricks on the strip=more outlets you actually have access to).<br/><br/>I highly recommend this item for anyone working on a home studio setup.</span>

<span>I love this headphone amp!  In the recording studio I've tried other amps by Rolls, but it's a step down from the original signal that is being given to it.  The PreSonus HP4 is a totally different story.  In fact, I use one to drive my headphones for regular music listening.  My computer audio interface has a pretty good headphone jack, but when I run the output signal to the HP4 and plug my headphones in there instead, the difference is amazing.  I have some big headphones (Sennheiser HD 280 and HD 595), and they need a lot of power to sound right.  The extra headroom provided by the HP4 makes especially the low end sound a lot better at medium volumes.<br/><br/>I also use the HP4 for watching movies or listening to music (or playing video games) with friends when someone else in the room doesn't want to be bothered by the sound.  It's great to be able to hand out headphones and let everyone listen at a volume that is comfortable for them.<br/><br/>A few more things:<br/>- Durability is great.  This has a metal case and can take some abuse, although I'd be careful with the knobs because they stick out pretty far.<br/>- No sound (hiss, static, pops, etc.) when adjusting volume, unlike many other headphone amps.<br/>- Separate left and right inputs, not a stereo plug, making this perfect for use with a mixer or audio interface.<br/><br/>Overall I'd highly recommend this to anyone who needs either more headphone channels or a nice-sounding amp to drive a pair of power-hungry higher-end headphones.</span>

<span>I have a Focusrite that tragically had the all too common headphone jack die.  So it was either: send it or for repair, spending weeks without being able to use my studio, spend another $400+ for a replacement....or this.<br/><br/>I went this route because I wanted expanded headphone capability anyway.  Glad I did.  This baby sounds great, was an under $100 problem fix, and now 4 people can use headphones at once.<br/><br/>So, great device, easy to use, great price.</span>

FiiO A5 Portable Headphone Amplifier (Black) FiiO A5 achieves nearly the same powerful output of the original E12 Mont Blanc unit but with improved channel balance and a lower noise floor that's ideal for driving highly sensitive in-ear headphones on the 'Low Gain' setting. The A5 topology is a robust 'analog-only' [ i.e., no digital DAC connectivity] portable headphone amp design capable of delivering a whopping +/- 11 Volts of clean power, so the A5 can also easily drive even very power-hungry full size headphones on its 'High Gain' mode, including many recent high-end planar magnetic audiophile models. The battery run time of the FiiO A5 unit rates somewhere around 12-13 hours, so you'll be able to keep the music flowing without worries when you're listening on the go all day or during those long cross continental flights. In addition to the High/Low gain switch, the A5 unit also has a bass boost button, so it does allows for some audio customization for your particular headphones and listening tastes. A high-quality smooth operation ALPS potentiometer graces the front panel along with the gain switch, plus 3.5mm line input and headphone outputs placed side by side. The super-slim A5 amp housing contains the bass boost switch on the side panel next to the USB charging connector. The top case shows off two mini LED lights, a deep blue LED light indicating on/off and a red light showing the battery charging status. The A5 amp case itself is an extremely slim-profile, sandblasted grey aluminum chassis and it measures approximately 2 1/2" inches wide by 4 1/2" inches long and only a 1/4" thick - so no doubt, it's a really small little box! The FiiO A5's slick and sturdy aluminum build quality joined with its miniaturized but super-potent headphone amp circuit delivers a massive audio statement in sound quality performance and muscular output power from a tiny palm-sized device.

<span>I was a little concerned by some of the reviews I read about construction values and workmanship.  The unit I received, howrver, was well built and performs above my expectations.  The unit is the perfect size.  The volume control is firm and allows for precise control with the perfect amount of resistance and a reasuring click when it is turned all the way off.  I was even very impressed with the minimal amount of heat produced even after a lengthy listening session. I coupled this with a pair of Beyerdymanic 250 Ohm DT770 Pro's and a new LG V30 with its outstanding builit in quad DAC and I close my eyes and am taken away!!</span>

<span>This product works well with my headphones. I also have a small tube amplifier.<br/><br/>The on and off switch on this device doesn't actually control the power, but rather a bass boost. (Correct me if I'm wrong.) When on it adds a hefty kick to your lows, for pleasurable listening experiences without busting the bank.<br/><br/>The highs and mids sound decently great also, nothing is over powered or under powered. For the price this product is hard working, and very portable. This has lasted through several hours of listening.

<span>The A5 is a great portable amp. I purchased it to stack with my X5 Mk III and ATH-M50/HD 650. It drives the M50s with authority and can go very loud and hits hard with bass. Enough to rattle your skull. It sounds very good with the HD 650s too BUT doesn’t drive them nearly as hard. I was slightly disappointed that it doesn’t drive with nearly the authority as it does with the M50s. That’s no fault of the A5 though as the HD 650s are a 300ohm headphone and need a lot of good power to drive them hard. Either way, the A5 is a great amp and I’m loving mine. Worth every penny. I hope Fiio continues what they are doing and I’ll keep buying.</span>

<span>This A5 amp is amazing!! It arrived very quickly!!!There are two very small lights on it; one illuminates blue to let you know that your A5 amp is on and the other light is for the battery life. When the A5 has enough battery life, the light does not come on, but when the battery life is low, it flashes​ red. It will also flash red when it's charging, and it will stay solid red when it's fully charged. There's a dial to turn the volume up and down from the device it's connected to. In low gain, the volume level is normal, but when you switch it into high gain, the volume level will go way up, so be careful if you're listening​ to music or podcasts through your earphones, your headphones, your car radio,  or through your speakers/radio/surround sound at home. There are two 3.5mm headphone jacks; one is for audio in (where you plug in your smartphone, music player/MP3 player, tablet, laptop, etc.), which is the jack with the symbol of a box with an arrow in it, and the audio out (where you plug in your earphones, headphones, into your car radio, into your home radio, etc.), which is the jack with the symbol of a pair of headphones. There's also a switch where you can turn the bass on and off.</span>

<span>This is going to be a live review typed while I listen through The Pyle-Pro PHA40-A. If you dont want to read it all, just skip down to the CONCLUSION<br/><br/>My setup to get the fairest most balance review that I can is to take my laptop through a Roland Duo-Capture (USB) and then run a patch cable from the Duo-Capture to the Headphone Amplifier. All volumes on the laptop is maxed and the Duo-Capture are set at 75%. The Pyle is set at neutral (with knobs at the 12 oclock position)<br/><br/>My Test Playlist is: Safri duo - The Bongo Song, E-Type - Campione, The Irish Symphonia - Feet of Flames, Haiku D'Etat - Non Compos Mentis, Sponge - Plowed, and Queen - We Are the Champions.<br/>The Heaphones I am using in this test are: Grado SR125, A&amp;H Xone XD-53, AKG K701, and Beyerdynamic DT770's.<br/><br/>The first song starts off and I am wearing my Grado's.  The Bongo Song is pretty much all drums. but there isn't enough power driving my Grado's to make it pop. The XD-53s work well with this song even though they tend to require more power. I am not noticing a particular loss of sound quality but the volume is softer with the open pack cans than with the close back cans. The 701's are miserable to listen to on this one. Very little definition from the song and the huge soundstage of the cans make it sound even smaller, the DT770's require the most power to drive but are still at a good volume.<br/><br/>Campione, a techno song is again soft in the Grado's and the 701's, the Xones are getting some distortion without volume change but the DT770's are awesome on this song. They are right at home.<br/><br/>So far no clicking or any jack issues as reported by other reviewers. Also so far Im noticing that closed back headphones are definitely at an advantage. I am not playing with the volume knobs at all.<br/><br/>Feet of Flames, heavy on the strings is okay with the Grado's. Soft, but thats expected. Not muddy, but not brilliant either. On the Xones, the sound is a tad darker than the Grado's but without the driving baseline all I get is a higher volume than the Grados.  The 701's... Oh wow! The definition and clarity is amazing. Yes its softer than the Xones, but each note is carried, each instruments voice and tones are captured perfectly. By far this is the 701's favorite song through the Pyle. The huge soundstage is loving it and really sounds great. The Beyerdynamics are loud. Louder than the XD-53s they are flat sounding and I get my first blip in the sound. Im not sure if thats the small laptop clipping or having problems keeping up with the dataflow from this high bitrate song. The volume is appreciated through the DT770's but it doesnt have the clarity that the 701's did.<br/><br/>Non Compos Mentis is hip-hop. As expected the DT770s and the 53's are louder than the Grado's and 701s. Its just subpar on all the cans.<br/><br/>Plowed is a standard rock song. Its not well known but is decent. The vocals are coming through no issue with the Grado's. Im hearing all the instruments and the song is shining but I wish the volume was better like the Xone's, which are louder but dont carry the clarity. The 701's arent any better, in fact they are softer than the Grados. Much better clarity than the 53s. The DT770s again strike the best balance between volume and listenability, but even then there isnt enough juice to power more than the mids on this song.<br/><br/>Queen starts off wonderfully in the Grado's. There is a great punchiness to this song despite being softer. This is the best song so far for the Grado's on this setup. The Xone's are good with this song too. The thematicness of the song comes through well. Its also softer than other songs but better than the Grados but not by much in the loudness section. The 701s enjoy the song but the Grado's still are better. There just isnt enough umph from the  Pyle to make the headphones really sing. The DT 770's are the loudest on this song but dont treat it nearly so well as everything just runs together and creates a kind of muddiness. There is a buzzing sound too with the upper registers of Freddie Mercury's voice that wasnt present in the Grado's like the amp really cant push as much.<br/><br/>Now for more of a test. Im using the Grado's for this in the #1 jack. As I adjust the volume knob, the levels change smoothely with no clipping. I get distortion at the top end as the headphone drivers can't keep up. Queen sounds great!  Playing with the volume knob I get the Bongo Song to come alive, but as I move the levels around I lose clarity with volume change. The Pyle really likes the higher volumes over the lower volumes and as I move into another song I have to find the sweet spot for that song for the best listening to the song to strike the right balance between loudness/volume, clarity, depth, brightness, etc.  Its definitely better than neutral but I loose so much as I lower the volume that there are definitely more changes than just volume as I turn it. Im not exactly pleased with that. I get all the songs to really come through but  now for the next test.<br/><br/>I bet you were all wondering why I included the Duo-Capture huh?<br/>Well, I unplug the Pyle from the Duo-Capture and plug the Grado's into the Roland.  First off, the volume is much better than anything I was getting out of the Pyle (granted 1 headphone instead of 4 but still...) and I get much better clarity. The songs pop. Feet of Flames is inspiring, Non Compos Mentis is not perfect but is much better than the sad mediocrity is sounded like on the Pyle. The Bongo Song is roughly about the same but with more bass hz input and sounds more well rounded. Campione sounds more like the game-score it is than something roughly thrown together While Plowed comes through with such great guitar that there is no comparison to how it sounded on the Pyle. Queen comes in again softer than the other songs, but that probably more due to the recording. As I adjust the volume on the Roland, all that changes is the volume. And Max volume is still loads louder than max volume on the Pyle.<br/><br/>CONCLUSION<br/>The Pyle PRO PHA40-4 is most definitely NOT a headphone AMPLIFIER but is does make for a decent powered headphone SPLITTER.  I would expect an amplifier to better drive large driver headphones and provide more volume than the originating signal on its own does. I expect a headphone amplifier to provide the same audio quality and (for lack of a better term) "features". I want to hear the same song the same way no matter where I position the volume rheostat and the Pyle just doesnt provide that. Granted not alot of people will know, but this is something that I would put in the guest bedroom or take to work and not worry about.<br/><br/>REDEEMING QUALITIES: Price - Its CHEAP compared to others. It does not require batteries. Its small. And people who haven't really compared it to much else wont notice what its lacking.<br/><br/>MY ADVICE: Get something else for yourself. Spend more money and get something that sounds better. FIIO's E9 (or E1 for that matter) or an ART, or Creek or Topping or something that isnt THIS. And Yes, I gave it TWO stars mainly because its price and having a powered headphone splitter could occasionally come in useful.<br/><br/>The Pyle Pro PHA40-4 is in the lower right corner of the picture next to my laptop.</span>

<span>I actually wanted to use this as a pre-amp rather than a headphone amp. Before I did anything I plugged some ear buds (low impedance) into the device and like others have mentioned, the output is less than just having my earbuds plugged into the source. This is surprising since the device is listed as a 'headphone amp'. To me, that means it should have sufficient gain and output impedance to drive MOST headphones louder than the source. Earbuds are not headphones, but still.<br/><br/>I got out my scope and measured the output impedance at a few frequencies. Came out to around 470ohm which is surprisingly high considering most headphone manufacturers have been edging toward lower impedance units. Sure, 650ohm headphones still exist, but I feel like the lower impedance models are more common now. If you're an audiophile who uses quality headphones you probably are familiar with damping factor and you can see how this cheap unit will never achieve even 2:1 damping factor, let alone what is generally considered optimal (4:1-8:1).<br/><br/>This unit is a clone of any of the 4 channel headphone amps you see, like Behringer for instance. It uses cheap 4850 opamps. It appears that the input signal is boosted by a factor of 10 and then each channel has it's own opamp set to a max of unity gain with the pots. If you run the pots to max, the opamps clip to the lower rail and you will get distortion.<br/><br/>Assuming you run the channels at 80% or less, the distortion figures are pretty good. I saw some variations in gain over a frequency sweep from 20-20k, but nothing crazy. Impedance was solid across the same frequency sweep. Based on my analysis, if your headphones are anything below 100ohm, you can only consider this a splitter with independent volume control. It won't amplify anything. Higher than 100ohm, you will get some amplification. Whoever has complained about mono vs stereo doesn't know what they are talking about. It's a stereo unit, it uses dual channel opamps all the way through.<br/><br/>I'm giving it 3 stars because it's supposed to be a general purpose headphone amp and without explicitly stating the high output impedance, it's going to disappoint a lot of folks with 32ohm headphones and it will never achieve a 'good' damping factor with any headphones. It also shouldn't clip to a rail at any pot setting. It actually works great as a cheap turnkey pre-amp assuming you are feeding a high impedance input to a secondary amplifier. Also, if you're comfortable soldering, definitely open the case up and check the TRS connector solders. Mine were not well flooded which inevitably will lead to those solder joints failing with the stress of plugging/unplugging.</span>

<span>I have to start off this review by addressing several of the one-star reviews that this device as woefully underpowered for their use. Most of them have apparently tried to connect this device to speakers, which it will not be able to drive at all.<br/><br/>This is a **headphone** amplifier and when used as such it will be more than loud enough. If you need a speaker (or PA) system, look at other products. This is only for people wanting to boost and/or split their headphone output.<br/><br/>Now, I agree with one-star reviews if you have a channel (it tends to be channel #1) that only provides static when used with headphones and there are a couple of those reviews out there. Luckily, all four channels on my device work flawlessly. If I lose a channel, this review (and the star rating I give it) will be adjusted accordingly. That being said, I'd still give this about four stars with a channel not working because I don't need four channels... I only need two. Anyway, on with the review.<br/><br/>BOTTOM LINE - A great little device that amplifies stereo input for headphones (AND) allows you to split the output into four seperate stereo channels, each with it's own volume control.<br/><br/>NOTE: This plays very nicely with the Hosa MHE325 Female TRS 1/8-Inch to Male TRS 1/4-Inch Headphone Adaper Cable (25 ft, ~$10) which allows you to position the box where you need it (i.e. near the TV) and gives you extra cord to reach across a room. You'll want one of these cables per channel (unless you want to use a splitter at the end)<br/><br/>Pro's<br/>- Powerful &amp; Compact<br/>- Single-Channel Input to (up to) 4 channel (HEADPHONE level) output<br/>- Individual volume controls for each channel<br/>- Price<br/>- Solid construction<br/>- NOT battery powered<br/><br/>Con's<br/>- Bright Red LED<br/>- Always On<br/><br/>Review: I purchased this, like a lot of other reviewers to amplify sound from our television's audio out port to headphones.<br/><br/>We were using a long cable with a series of adapters and a splitter so we could have two sets of headphones and listen to the television quietly after the kiddos were in bed. Since our TV output is RCA, we needed to convert that to a 1/8" (female) stereo plug and then add in a splitter. Since the audio on the TV was a "line-out" port, we had no control over the volume and it was just barely loud enough to hear anything.<br/><br/>I eventually got frustrated with not hearing half of the conversations on our favorite programs and began to look for a full receiver that had a headphone output on the front that I could use. I really didn't cherish having to drop a couple of hundred dollars on a speaker system I'd hardly use.<br/><br/>I stumbled across this item by chance and decided at the low price point I'd give it a shot. I was very pleasantly surprised with the outcome. The box is very small and well constructed. It's very powerful (only needed the channel turned up less than a quarter of the way to hear it very loud and clear through our headphones).<br/><br/>My only real complaint is the little red LED on the front of the box is so bright, it distracts when the lights in the room are out and we are watching TV. I used a small piece of black electrical tape to cover it up and it's much better. Another minor gripe is the fact that there is no on-off switch so it's always on... but since my DVR is always on, this is a minor concern. We also plugged ours into our surge protector (which is highly recommended when working with sound equipment).<br/><br/>All in all, this is a wonderful little device that will definitely work nicely as a headphone amplifier and channel splitter. If you are need of something like this... Pyle has you covered.<br/><br/>If you are looking for something to power speakers, don't buy this. Look for a good PA system instead.</span>
