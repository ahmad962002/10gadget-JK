<span>My job is entirely Google based.  I bought this as a second work computer because my company laptop is a Thinkpad and it's heavy.  I just wanted to leave that at home and have a nice sleek backup for any work tasks I'd need to do in a pinch out of the house.  I couldn't be more pleased with this.  It's light, fast, and the battery life is fantastic.  Lenovos are known for having great keyboards and this is the best one I've used on a small laptop.  It also doesn't look or feel cheap.  The only thing that shows 'budget' is the screen, as it won't blow you away.  But it's still very solid and surprisingly good from the side, where most screens in this price range are garbage viewed from an angle.  If you are in the market for a laptop, and you are in the probably 95% of the public that absolutely doesn't really need an $800 laptop for what they use it for, rush out and buy this one while the price is still insane.</span>

<span>I really like this chrome book.  Very light weight. Very easy to set up. It automatically synced with my older one and transferred all my bookmarks over, along with most passwords.<br/>Great for the money and ease.</span>

<span>Chromebooks have a life cycle of 8 years - this one was made in 2020, so it has about 6 or so years of support left. I didn't care and all I wanted was something small and light so I could write on my bed. I don't mind that it's a chromebook - in fact, this is my first chromebook and I'm in love. I'm planning to get another one for Black Friday if the price is good enough, because I love this one so much (I[m planning to have an indoor chromebook and an outdoor chromebook). The screen is a bit iffy, but it's good enough. I use this one more than I do my $700 tablet. I don't do anything heavy with it, so this is perfect for my needs.</span>

If you’re a deal hunter and are good at what you do, I guarantee you can find better.<br/><br/>If you’re like me, don’t have time to scout the internet, and realized product quality keeps getting poorer and poorer in order to keep from raising prices consistent with inflation, then it’s possible at some point you’re going to settle on something that fits your budget and you’ll accept only being reasonably happy with it (aka I settled).<br/><br/>Here is my observation of each aspect of the laptop:<br/>* The screen quality is good, but the factory settings have the blacks set too dark and the brightness not bright enough, so I’m going to provide instructions for how to adjust that in just a moment.<br/><br/>* The battery life is ok, lasting me about 7 hours currently. We will see how long that keeps up, as I find cheap laptop battery lives are typically trash after about 1-2 years.<br/><br/>* The keys feel good to type on, which I was relieved to find.<br/><br/>* The speed of the laptop is only alright. For an SSD, I expected it to be faster. This machine will stream video just fine, but don’t plan on doing any video editing or gaming.<br/><br/>* The weight is actually very nice, but that should be expected with such a small screen.<br/><br/>* One thing I think this machine actually does well is that it does not get very hot, which I like. Previously I was using a laptop cooling pad with a fan, but this computer does not need that. I can set it directly on my bed and it only gets a little warm.<br/><br/>* Lastly, and unfortunately, the touchpad needs an upgrade in order to make it usable. At first I thought I could adjust this in the windows touchpad settings. But after doing so, I realized it is not a software issue.<br/><br/>The problem is that the touchpad itself is not physically smooth enough. So in effect, what happens is that there is too much friction between your fingers and the pad. That is fine when you’re moving the cursor large distances across the screen, but it means that fine, small movements are difficult to achieve. It was very frustrating to not be able to click directly where I needed to because of this.<br/><br/>Luckily, I came up with a solution. You will need to order a touchpad cover / skin for $10. They are basically similar to the screen protectors used on cell phones. It will adhere to the touch pad and provide a much smoother surface. This worked well. The only drawback was that I was not able to find a skin that was made for this laptop, so I had to order a larger one and cut it down to size.<br/><br/>Here are the instructions to accomplish both of these tweaks:<br/><br/>Fix screen settings:<br/>right click on the desktop &gt; show more options &gt; AMD radeon software &gt; display &gt; reduce contrast to 94 &gt; increase the brightness to 25<br/><br/>Fix touchpad by searching for this on amazon:<br/><br/>CaseBuy MacBook Air 13 Inch Trackpad Protector Cover trackpad skin<br/><br/>cut it down to size and install it<br/><br/>(make sure you read the reviews on this trackpad skin as it is a bit tricky to install and users have posted helpful tips to make sure you don’t have any bubbles in it after you’re done)<br/><br/>After you’re done installing it, you’ll need to increase the touchpad sensitivity.<br/><br/>Go to:<br/>Windows settings &gt; bluetooth &amp; devices &gt; touchpad &gt; taps &gt; touchpad sensitivity &gt; high sensitivity<br/><br/>That’s all I’ve got. Setting up my new iphone gave me a large amount of respect for the seamlessness of the process and the intelligent design that went into it. Windows laptops still have a long way to go before user experience becomes the reason I use them.</span>

<span>So this was the first non high-end gaming laptop I've ever purchased, with the intent of using it as a cheap laptop to carry around for school, work, and general basic use. To be quite honest, it's surprisingly nice! After I got over the initial shock of downgrading to a 15" display from my previous 17", the screen is of good quality. The processing speed is not disappointing at all. The sound is great (it actually can get obnoxiously loud if you are into that). I don't find Windows 11 to be offensive to use. Keyboard is friendly. It seems to be built well and feels of decent quality (not super cheap feeling). It's light to carry. Loads videos and webpages quickly. No crashing or general use issues as of yet. I've even run the full Adobe Creative Suite on this thing and it's running just fine. I'm really pleasantly surprised. And coming from someone who is used to a 5k+ Alienware Gaming Laptop (aka me), the fact that I don't hate this thing is truly impressive enough. If you pressed me to find something I don't love about it, I'd say the fan seems to run more than expected and the battery life is meh. It gives you zero warning before just shutting off after dying. But after the panic subsided that I had just possibly lost all my work, I plugged it in and hit the power button, only to be giddy with happiness that it just booted up with all my web pages still loaded and logged in the way I left it. So I am not even mad. No touch screen on my model. And I can't attest to it's gaming abilities because, well, I have an Alienware for that. Seriously though, best spent $400 ever.</span>

<span>this is a good cheap laptop for doing various activities, however gaming is a very poor experience on this laptop. i dont know why it is marketed for gaming, as it can barely hit 30 frames at 1080 on most games. i assume you could run some very light indie games or super well optimised games on it, but anything that requires any kind of gpu power, forget about it. i will still give 5 stars tho because it does everything i need it to and does it well. good battery life i usually get at least 5 hours of use out of it per charge.</span>

<span>ASUS has the worst support, and Microsoft Windows 10 is terrible. I thought that updating to Windows 10 2004 would be a good idea, but that was a bad idea. Now I can not get back to the previous version, and there are a couple of games that can not run on 2004 -- resulting in a blue screen BSOD. I reinstalled Windows 10, using the "local" option, so not from the internet, but it's 2004 somehow. There are no options in the settings to roll back and MyAsus also provides no guidance. ASUS support TERRIBLE (and so is Microsoft). Crappy, spending this much money on a laptop that isn't usable.</span>

<span>I'm not a hardcore gamer but having lived with a Dell E6410 for the last 10 years I knew I wanted to upgrade once that system could no longer even play World of Warships.. So I researched around and decided on this system from Asus.  I do like Asus products to being with, they always seem well made to me.  I decided to go with the RX 2080 GPU so as to get as many years out of this thing going forward as I possibly can, obviously the GPU blows away anything I'm trying to use it for now.  I'm not an expert so I just plugged and played World of Warships with max'ed out settings and was getting 75 fps on average, good enough for me to be impressed.  My only regret is that there wasn't a larger SSD drive configuration with either 1TB or 2TB at the time I bought the laptop, those were not options on the item at the time.</span>

<span>Bought this for my wife - and as a computer I could use for my programming needs if my main machine were to ever fail.  This computer is perfect for surfing the web, writing a book, doing basic home or mid level computing needs.  I upgraded this computer with a 2T SDD (easy to do folks - take the screws off the bottom and carefully lift up the base and everything is exposed).  JUST MAKE SURE you get the correct SDD for the slot (check online for what SDD connector is in this machine).  By the way, you don't need the fastest card in the world for this thing.  Even the lowest end SDD will work just fine in this thing.  As for RAM, it really only needs another 4 to 8 gig of RAM and it'll be a slightly faster machine for you.<br/> What usually slows these laptops down is the "memory paging" - if you can keep the computer from paging memory (aka "disk thrashing") you'll enjoy the computer much more.</span>

<span>So we just got this laptop a couple days ago, and I'll update things as they go along. Firstly it's a pretty decent laptop for the money, trying to read reviews on it is a pretty mixed basket because they have so many other cheap/er laptops that most of the reviews are not for this one. So you'll have to pay attention to the model number they are reviewing. (Acer Aspire 5 A515-56-702V)<br/>Here's a couple of my deciding points which lead to the purchase:<br/><br/>- Aluminum case (not super thick but still not plastic) has a more sturdy feel to it (within reason as this is not a $2K laptop).<br/><br/>- Solid Intel i7 Processor, first came to market Sep 2020. Good sized cache.<br/><br/>- It has a 512GB NVMe SSD drive in it which is the M.2 format, these are some of the fastest drives out right now as far as standards go. Most laptops with SSD are taking about the SATA drives, which while fast, are not anywhere close to the M.2 speeds.<br/><br/>- Being that it's an M.2 drive this leaves an entire drive bay empty in the laptop for future storage upgrade (SATA) if needed or having an alternate backup drive right in the laptop etc. (i.e. expandable in the future if you need it)<br/><br/>- It has 16GB of memory, I'm not sure why so many laptops out there only have 8GB, just running basic windows will eat at least 5GB+ of memory which doesn't leave a lot left for everything else. (In my humble opinion) and I appreciated the ability to upgrade that further in the future if needed to 24GB.<br/><br/>- It has plenty of USB ports and HDMI out for conference rooms/TV's etc.<br/><br/>Some of the cons:<br/>- The power adapter is a very small "pin" power adapter. Needless to say this was rather disappointing because we all know that sometimes cords get pulled or bumped etc. And it's likely to damage the internals because it's very small. I would have liked to see one of the thicker power adapter connections just for strength.<br/>- Windows 11 - Personally I'm not a huge fan thus far but mainly just for functionality reasons like you can't ungroup open programs on the task bar, it's one icon and that's it with no ability to change it. It's not a tablet it's a computer.<br/>- No Thunderbolt Port<br/>- No option to charge via USB C (which would negate the very tiny pin adapter)<br/><br/>So we did run into a couple issues. We had a problem with the laptop not seeing the power cord plugged in, it would blink as if it was going to start working (windows battery page in settings) then act like it was never plugged in. We reached out to Acer and they had us reset the battery via a paperclip and pin hole on the bottom. It's worked find so far after that. Getting a tech on the online chat via Acer support was fast and he was able to quickly resolve the issue.<br/><br/>So generally, this being my very first Acer Laptop, I'm pleased with things so far. We'll see how it holds up in the long run.</span>

<span>I love my Chromebook, especially since I got it for a huge discounted price. It runs seamlessly with my phone yet the browser works more like on a laptop vs. a phone. The battery life is surprisingly long and it's so lightweight that I use it for all my writing over my laptop. I wasn't sure how I'd like a Chromebook but I absolutely love it! It's both a laptop and a tablet since you can fold the keyboard completely back to use the touchscreen. I highly recommend one, you'll use it more often than you think.</span>

<span>Full disclosure, I am not an IT professional but use laptops, tablets, and desktop computers daily in my personal and work life. This chromebook has far exceeded my expectations. This is my first time using a chromebook. I have had a week or so to really dig into the device. I own an alienware gaming laptop, but I find myself only using it now for gaming purposes only.<br/><br/>This chromebook is fast in my opinion. The speed is snappy and the device responds quickly to gestures and commands. I have yet to find sometime I can't do on this that I do on my windows laptop aside from gaming. One game I like to play requires windows, mac, or linux. Since this has an ARM processor it does not support linux applications at this time.<br/><br/>Design: This device is a bright attractive white chromebook. I find the design to be pleasing to the eye and appears sturdy even though it is made from plastic. I do not particularly like using it in tablet mode. The screen feels bulky and sometimes unmanageable in tablet mode. The screen quickly transitions to whatever position to place it in whether laptop, tent, or tablet mode. I personal find myself not even using my LG tablet for much of anything except when I need LTE internet away from home. Overall the design is great.<br/><br/>Screen/Input: I find the keyboard to be on par with most laptop keyboards. The keys are a little shallow and I feel my typing has slowed a little bit, but not by much. The IPS touchscreen is very responsive and rarely find myself having to touch the screen more than once for my intended gesture. Screen is bright in home conditions, but feel it would lack in more intense lighting situations, such as outdoors.<br/><br/>Ease of Use: The google play store makes this thing be able to do just about anything. I have not tried any intense applications. I use chrome, netflix, hulu, evernote, several banking apps, and various other apps. All of them are snappy responsive. The bank apps load like they are in phone mode, thus they are in a small window. The apps still work as designed. Netflix and Hulu playback is smooth and pleasant to watch on the screen.<br/><br/>Overall, I am impressed with the Google OS and this device in general. If your someone who is on the fence about the operating system, I suggest you give it a try. The battery life is good as well. When using my gaming laptop its always with a cord tethered nearby. I also understand a gaming laptop is far more power intensive. I have yet to use this chromebook while charging it. The battery has allowed me to watch 4-5 hours of netflix, talk on facebook, and text through my phone without ever getting critically low. I charge it at night and then never put it back on till the next night. This is a max screen brightness. I was also very surprised with the speakers. The speakers were much louder and not distorted. I honestly expected them to be cheap netbook quality that is mostly better just to never use them, but thats not the case with this chromebook. I do generally use a bluetooth headset. The bluetooth headset paired with extreme simplicity. I also set up my brother wireless laser printer with google cloud print in less than 30 seconds.<br/><br/>Google did it right and lenovo delivered a solid product. I did purchase this on sale for $200 but would have spent the $300. If your a web surfer, music listener, netflix watcher I highly recommend this. If you need windows intense software then go with windows. Otherwise I think you'll find yourself using this as your primary device as I have.</span>

<span>I bought this computer while on a trip to replace a different Lenovo computer that died while I was on deadline for an assignment while traveling. Fortunately, I was able to get this next-day Prime delivered to where I was staying in LA and began using it minutes after it arrived. To make this review easy, I'm breaking it down by main key features: display, keyboard, battery life, and build quality.<br/><br/>Display: For the price, I don't think you're going to find one much nicer in terms of resolution and quality. Incredibly, you are getting a true IPS panel with nice viewing angles. I've found that the low res matte displays on other cheaper Chromebooks are incredibly difficult use and lead to eye strain. I'm a personal believer in purchasing as much screen real estate and pixel density as possible -- it really does make a huge difference. Another huge plus (and I'm not sure if this across the Chromebook line or specific to this one) is the night mode that cuts out blue light and boosts yellows -- this is another hugely important feature for me, personally. Touch screen functionality works fine. Display cons are that the bezels are massive and with it being super glossy, there can be lots of glare.<br/><br/>Keyboard: Basically Lenovo has it figured out with keyboard layouts and feel. While it's nowhere near as nice as the Thinkpad keyboard, this one is laid out quite nicely and is easy to complete bigger writing assignments on. There's no backlight, which would be a huge plus, but for the price, it's difficult to find anything to complain about. The top row function keys will be familiar to those coming from the Mac ecosystem. Everything is very easy. The trackpad is also surprisingly nice for the price as well. Gestures work without issue.<br/><br/>Battery life: This is where this computer truly shines. I purchased this while I was traveling during the winter and needed to it to complete weekly freelance assignments and had plenty of battery life while on the road. Even when being back home laying in bed watching Youtube or Netflix, the battery lasts all night, and then some. I basically never take the charger with me because I don't feel that it's necessary (unless it's already low on juice). In terms of just general surfing and Google doc stuff, you should be able to get a couple of days out of the battery. If you're watching videos and streaming, it's still a good full day's worth of battery life.<br/><br/>Build quality: I've previously had an HP Chromebook and was not impressed by the build quality by any means. It felt cheap, almost like a toy. While this Lenovo Chromebook feels much more solid, I still wouldn't compare it to a Thinkpad or the higher end machines in Lenovo's lineup. Still, it feels quite durable and I've never worried about carrying it in a pack all day, or stacking books and other heavy items on top of it. The only thing that is kind of a bother is that the brilliant white finish does get smudges and dirty fingerprints on it. But that's more of a nuisance, not a flaw with the machine.<br/><br/>For the price, you really can't do much better. So long as you have reasonable expectations for what you're getting and how much you're paying, you will be very pleased by this product.</span>

<span>I specifically got this because it was advertised as having both an SSD and a large HDD. It only has the SSD. Yes it is blazing fast but I would’ve gotten another model if I knew it would have such small storage size.<br/><br/>It does have an extra bay, you can install an HDD if you want to, but I wanted to avoid having to do that. If I wanted to tinker with my pc I’d build one outright, this was supposed to be a simple copout. Overall I’m very disappointed, it is a good pc and I’ll make the most out of it, don’t even want to deal with refunds or customer service, but it’s definitely not what I wanted so I have to give it a low score.</span>

<span>I have always had a gaming pc with the newest hardware, but recently I became a father and wanted something portable to game on. So far every game I have played has been at maxed settings, at the screens max resolution of 1080p and the frame rates have been 60+ solid. So far I have played Diablo 3, Torchlight 3, Outer Worlds, Rage 2, RTX minecraft, Astroneer, Metro Last Light, Neon Abyss, No mans sky, and a bunch of other games on game pass. If you don't mind 1080p its great. RTX minecraft seemed to be the only game where the frame rates dropped to the 30-40 range with RTX and max settings.<br/><br/>It does get hot so I had to get a fan cooler to help blow in some cooler air in from underneath. The fan noise is pretty loud while gaming so headphones help with that. Also the speakers must be at the bottom of the laptop and they do not get very loud at all.  The touch pad seems glitchy at times while scrolling so I end up using a mouse. The power brick gets pretty hot and its pretty far up the cord so it gets in the way when trying to game in the living room and moving it from the coffee table to the couch.</span>

<span>Hard drive failure after only 6 months...  Sent to ASUS for warranty 1 month ago.  They received it 16 days ago and I have called several times after seeing that their online status check showed no change in status (Appears to not made it past receiving).  I have called their Support several times and each time no one can tell me what is going on with my laptop, if anyone has looked at it, or provide ANY kind of idea when it will be ready.  Ratings looked great on Amazon, yet I am guessing that must be from folks who never had a Support issue....  From what I am reading elsewhere, ASUS is know for terrible Support.  Do yourself a favor and pay a little more for a quality product from somewhere else.  At this point,</span>

<span>Picked this up Dec 2020 fully loaded with 2tb of NVME storage, 32 Gigs of ram and the 2060 graphics card. Love the performance when plugged in. Battery doesn't last when gaming very long.  The out of the box drivers for a few things had updated that needed to be applied. Ran into all kinds of audio issues during this process. Spent awhile researching, trying downloads from vendor directly vs the asus site, windows troubleshooter, reddit, etc... found a file explaining that the audio drivers needed to be applied via a powershell admin console file... tried that. Ran through the windows set up your mic again as a mic installed in another device. Now the mic works great so far. Really disappointed that the drivers are not less complex to update on a very expensive device. Reminded me very old PC voodoo.</span>

<span>the packaging was like nothing ive ever seen before and omg the keyboard. when i first saw it i had no words to describe how i fell but using it was another story. this laptop crunched through anything i threw at it and i was beyond amazed. one thing i should note is that under heavy loads i gets a bit loud but it doesn't bother me.</span>
