<span>I am a loyal VisonTek customer in terms of a good quality video card for 3, 4 or 6 monitors.  I have about 15 of them on various office machines. I have one 6 monitor, two 4 monitor and one 6 monitor cards.  They are great for a business environment needing multiple monitors. For gaming there are more powerful  alternatives.<br/><br/> However they are lacking in their connectors. Their 3 monitor card has a flimsy 3 way splitter that easily bends the socket or breaks the screws so I was delighted when their 4 and 6 monitor cards had mini-Display-Port (MDP) sockets.  The problem is their adapters.  Most monitors today have HDMI and DVI ports only. Few have Display Ports (DP).  The good news is that their ports are Active.  Active ports have power to support circuitry that converts on port type to another. However their 6 monitor card provides only MDP-to-DP adapters and their 4 monitor card only includes two MDP-to-DP and two MDP-to-DVI adapters.  If like most of us you have HDMI monitors, you have to buy their Active MDP-to-HDMI adapters or a quality aftermarket one.<br/><br/>Their tech support department which is pretty responsive by email said their cards will support two adapters or cables that are not active. A non-active adapter such as a cable with HDMI on one side and DP on the other side will work but only for 2 of the 4 or 6 monitors respectively depending on the card.<br/><br/>There are a couple other things.<br/>- They make these wonderfully engineered adapters with a screw-down screw so that they do not pull out of the card but the screw-down adapters are only available with a new card. They do not sell the screw-down versions à la carte and the Active MDP-to-HDMI which do not ship with the cards are not manufactured with screw downs. So if you have 4 or 6 of those plugged in on the respective board.<br/>- If you decide to go DVI, you can at least have one screw-down adapter.  Having one is a huge help because you can zip tie the others that have no screw-down to it and keep them from falling out of the board.  However DVI plugs are not particularly good for snaking up the pipe on a multi-monitor stand.<br/><br/>My suggestion to VisionTek is to sell the screw down adapters à la carte and ship the units with all MDP to HDMI adapters or sell them with 2-3 HDMI ports (because 4-6 won’t fit on most cards) that support “Y” cables. That way 2 HDMI ports with 2 “Y”s would support 4 monitors and and 3 HDMI ports with 3 “Y”s would support 6 monitors respectively.<br/><br/>So the bottom line is that if you want to do it right, you need 4 or 6 Active MDP-to-HDMI adapters preferably Vision Tek brand.  So plan on spending $25 each or $100 extra for the 4 monitor card and $150 extra for the 6 video card.  Also plan on having no screw downs; a great feature gone to waste.</span>

<span>I bought VisionTek card to run 6 Dell S2721QS 27 Inch 4K UHD monitors.  Functionally, it works and runs all 6 monitors. I just plugged all 6 in, and they worked.  But practically, the memory usage and 3D indicator for the GPU is frequently maxed per Task Manager and the mouse action on the screen becomes slow.  I split off one monitor to run directly from the CPU, but even with 5 it still has problems.  It works, and has never crashed, but is just slow.<br/><br/>On the 6 Dell Monitors, I keep open 2x6 = 12 browser screens with charting apps, Discord, WSJ, etc.  I was running even more, but it was just hammered.  The computer itself is overpowered with 64GB RAM, an Intel i9, 6 fans, Windows 11, etc.  At one point I was running ThinkOrSwim Charting, but that totally killed the VisionTek.<br/><br/>I was worried from the start that the VisionTek wouldn't be powerful enough, but finding graphics cards right now is VERY difficult.  And I'm not gaming or running video, so I thought perhaps it would work.  But it just doesn't as even Chrome and Explorer seem to need a decent GPU.  I have another computer with 5 screens running an NVIDIA GeForce RTX 2070 8GB that I bought several years ago, and it runs fine.  But the RTX 2070 is now$1200, if you can find one.<br/><br/>I've now found and ordered two new GTX 1050 graphics cards for $280 each with 4GB, and my plan is to instead run: (a) 2 monitors on GTX 1050 graphics card 1;  (b) 1 monitor off the i9 CPU; and (c) 2 monitors off GTX 1050 graphics card 2; and (d) 1 monitor off the VisionTek.<br/><br/>The other issue I had with the VisionTek was the VERY loud fan.  I had to unplug it and instead have a Noctua fan pointing directly at the VisionTek.  Heat doesn't seem to be the issue.</span>

<span>Unlike most users, I am not a gamer. I needed to upgrade the graphics card on my Dell XPS 8910 tower for the purposes of video editing using Davinci Resolve 17. The card that came with the unit did not support OpenCL and had only 2 GB of memory so the program would always fail when I tried to render even the simplest videos. So I was more interested in the ability of the GPU to support video and photo editing. From that perspective I am very happy. I was able to edit a half hour worth of 4K video without having to use proxy files and the video played smoothly while editing. And when it came to rendering, it worked flawlessly. Installation was very easy and the driver auto installed after a few minutes.<br/><br/>Gamers may have other opinions, but as a video editor on a fairly simple set up, it has been well worth the money.</span>

<span>Allowed me to hook up 3 totally different monitors with ZERO headaches. Two in landscape and one in Portrait. 27" 16:10 , 24" 16:10 and a 22" 16:9, one with VGA, one with DVI and one Display Port. All mixed match and they all look great and worked with no probs. Hooked up to a SFF PC, HP Elite 800 . I didn't use the included adapters. I bought cable matters cables to match my monitors and with mini Display port connectors on the other end.  I'm not a big nVidia fan but this thing just works.  You want 3-4 monitors, just spend the money, get this thing and be done .</span>

<span>This card did not work in my HP Envy, which has the requited PCIE x16 slot, 32Gb, Win10, etc.<br/>This is the second attempt to get a PNY NVS 510 video card working in this system.<br/>The first card arrived without an installation CD, though the one sheet of paper it did come with indicated that it was to be in the package. I installed the card but never got a response from either video monitor (LG G-Sync). I did try installing drivers downloaded from NVIDIA but they failed because the hardware cound not be found.<br/>I returned the card and got a replacement.<br/>The replacement came with an installation CD but there was no documentation, only drivers. The one sheet of instructions indicated that the installation guide was on the CD. It was not, and not in the unzipped contents of the driver as well. Undaunted, I installed this second card and the result was the same, no display. Actually the monitor said no signal and went to sleep.<br/>Additionally, installing this card into an HP Envy is a nightmare. I bent a couple of grounding fingers, attached to the case, because of the card's output panel small size.<br/>I'm returning this card also.<br/>I do not expect to buy a PNY card in the near future nor can I recommend one to anyone who has an HP Envy.</span>

<span>This review is from a customer who has purchased and installed about 10 of these now for our business.<br/><br/>This card works fine as long as you do not touch it.  The Mini Displayports on this card are either faulty, or Mini-Displayport technology itself is faulty.  After about 4-6 months of usage, the video's begin to not work and go black.  The problem is, if you slightly touch or bump the connection, it loses visual.  We then spend time trying to resolve it, rebooting, re-plugging up everything.  Eventually you can get your display back.. until you bump it again.<br/><br/>For the average home user, probably not an issue.  For businesses who need 4-8 screens working 24/7 on critical computers, this is not a good product.  Getting called at 2 am to come troubleshoot Faulty Graphic cards sucks.  I Have reached out to PNY for RMA, and they have been helpful in working with me to resolve it.  However, at this point, we do not want replacement cards.  We would rather have our money back and go buy Quad cards that have Displayport or HDMI inputs.  If we want to stay in the nVidia world and stay under $500 per card, that means rolling back nearly a decade to the NVS 450. Because this NVS 510 was the only Nvidia Card that had Quad capability on a low profile bracket.<br/><br/>This results in us looking back to ATI and their Cards for options.  I sincerely hope and wish nVidia/PNY is able to craft working technology for Quad monitor users who do not want to troubleshoot this issue any further.</span>

<span>Pros - Easy enough to install.  Not too expensive, and it has 2 HDMI outputs.  Drivers updated quickly.  Colors so much better on my 4 year old Dell 22" monitors.  Cons - I can't do anything else on the PC if I want to do any gaming.  I usually listen to some music or YouTube videos while playing FPS games online.  The card is not up to that.  I guess I needed way more VRAM than 1 GB.  Looks like I don't have a lot of options for a SFF machine, so that is my own issue, not an issue with the card.  I would return but I was overly optimistic and tossed the packaging.  At least it was open box so it was under $50.</span>

<span>I was just looking for a decent video card to upgrade beyond the onboard video (Radeon HD 4200 - yes, I know, ancient) on my MOBO and after doing much homework found that this card was the best fit for my system with the least amount of power requirements and the best performance.<br/><br/>PROS:<br/>- Fit like a charm in my HP Slimline.<br/>- Got both HDMI ports hooked up and having no issues with multiple displays.<br/>- Good for moderate gaming.  Probably won't be able to handle some of the newer games unless you setup custom profiles in Catalyst.<br/>- Handles rendering and intense GPU processing well.  Tested with ptGui and AutoCADD so far.  Got pretty good results, pretty quick.<br/>- Came with ATX case bracket, HDMI to DVI-D converter and drivers / ATI Catalyst software and instructions.<br/>- Rates at a 6.9 / 7.9 on Win7-64 with Phenom II X6 1065t CPU.<br/><br/>CONS:<br/>- NOISY.  Before I upgraded the video card I had about 17 - 20dB of noise from my system at idle.  Now it's about 35dB - 38dB at idle.  At 100% CPU usage it's about 55 - 60dB with case &amp; CPU fan at full throttle with all case covers on.  Pretty noisy.<br/>- HOT.  Hot to the touch.  Granted you shouldn't be "touching" the heat sinks on your GPU card but even from an overnight OFF state to on, it gets hot quickly.  Less than two minutes.<br/><br/>I'm being generous with the four star here because the heat and noise is almost a deal breaker. Hot and noisy just isn't a good combination for any type of electronics unless it's a device that is expected to produce heat and noise.  The card itself works great though.<br/><br/>For the cooling benefits, a fan is a good thing to have on your GPU.  For the noise, eh, not so much - especially the fan on this card.  Might want to go with a silent card that just has larger heat sinks and hope your case fan (if you have one) keeps your system cool enough or replace the fan with a liquid cooler for GPU cards (if you have the space).</span>

<span>The one shown in the picture is not the one that was shipped to me although I am not complaining because the one I was shipped  (an AMD Radeon HD 7700 Series) met and exceeded my expectations. Additionally, this card is for the HP Small Form Factor workstations in the Z200 series.<br/><br/>The difference between what is shown in the image with this product and what I received is that the GFX card has two (non-standard  [see image]) HDMI jacks although my new monitor (being an HP VH240a) came with the necessary cables. So this card is running a desktop with two monitors and it does it rapidly and seamlessly. I don't know whether or not it would be satisfactory for someone who is an intense gamer but for a computer engineer it is an elegant card with a very nice Dashboard for fine tuning both monitors (the second is an HP w2408h which is almost 10 years old) and this card is a major improvement over the motherboard's GPU. When I installed this card the older monitor's GFX definition was dramatically improved.<br/><br/>I am very happy with this card which I've been using since June 2019 and have no reservations in recommending this to other computer engineers or users who know how to install a card and use the CD to install the drivers, who want a very nice GFX card.</span>

<span>change one BIOS setting to make this work on some computers<br/><br/>This is to inform purchasers of a potential additional step required when installing this graphics card. My computer, an HP Envy 700 (and possibly other computers) required a change in one BIOS setting before this card will work. I cannot post a link here, so to find a solution for your computer you'll need to do an internet search. Or, if you can find a knowledgeable person at VisionTek , they also may be able to help with this.<br/><br/>The card did not work at all before changing the BIOS setting. After I changed the setting it worked fine. It was easy for me (not a computer expert) to change the BIOS setting.<br/><br/>I gave this 5 stars because it enables me to use a Cintiq Pro 16 drawing tablet and two screens with my 5 year old computer.</span>

<span>An older card of course (~2009), but it's great for similarly old computers, and easy on the wallet. I installed it in a 2011 Dell i7 2600 desktop with so-so onboard HD 2000 graphics &amp; Win 10 Pro. The card installed easily, and Win update automatically installed the correct driver. Picture is crisp, bright, and stable. Using a Radeon 5450, the picture would flicker and sometimes freeze; at first, I thought this was outside interference but found out from Microsoft Support that some older graphics drivers don't perform well with Windows 10/11. Have not had that issue with this card so far. Used in the right application, 5 stars based on ease of installation, performance, and bargain price.</span>

<span>First, I do not think the current price for this card is appropriate. I read some other reviews and had to roll my eyes that were complaining about the performance of this card. Stop buying things without researching them. Buying this and expecting to game, record your screen, etc in the current time is frankly ridiculous. This card was low end when it was new, and it's now 13 years old. $60 for a 13 year old card that pales in comparison to even modern integrated graphics is highway robbery. They must be selling overstock by now, I highly doubt they are still producing these, so there is no excuse, they are simply abusing the current GPU market. You will NOT be satisfied with the performance of this card for the cost, period. You could find a used AMD CPU with integrated graphics that would blow this out of the water for about the same money.<br/><br/>That said, I bought this card a few years ago for ~$30 iirc, which I think is a more reasonable cost. The purpose was to provide a display output for a server computer that has a CPU with no integrated video. No gaming, steaming, productivity work, etc. It has provided a simple display output to navigate the OS when needed (VNC programs rely on a display output to pick up in order to provide the remote functionality), which is rare. It has worked just fine, and still does to be fair. However, the tiny fan on it has developed a very loud whine that is indicative of impending physical failure (I have been in IT for ~20 years). I would expect to get at least 5+ years out of a video card that is barely used. I have much higher end cards in my families computers that are regularly stressed with gaming and various applications that support GPU hardware acceleration, and none of them have any issues, the most extreme example being a 780Ti that is now 9 years old. This is my singular experience so I may have been unlucky, but I am disappointed with the lack of reliability.<br/><br/>I now need to buy a replacement card, bc replacing the fan is not worth it. I came here to just get the same card because I am looking for the cheapest solution possible, but I will not be purchasing this card again simply because I cannot stomach the current price. It's sad, because it's difficult to find a simple display adapter on the cheap these days due to the GPU market, and these very low end cards aren't worth much to anyone that knows better, so it's hard to justify the cost for what you are getting out of it.</span>

VisionTek 7750 eye 4 2GB GDDR5 PCI Express Graphics Card is the hassle-free high-performance digital signage solution for retail hospitality commercial healthcare and more. The power to drive up to four displays in independent clone or extended mode via a single PC. Thanks to an energy efficient design, the 7750 eye 4 requires only 70 watts of power so it can be run off the system power bus. With most systems featuring a factory-installed 350 watt or higher power supply, you don't have to purchase and install a larger power supply. The 7750 eye 4 uses 2GB of higher bandwidth GDDR5 memory to deliver lag-free content with the highest resolution possible. Short Form Factor (SFF) design fits in today's Low Profile desktops and workstations via the short bracket mounted on the card. The card is convertible to standard ATX design with the included tall bracket for standard chassis as well. By incorporating Discrete Digital Multi-Point Audio technology into its chipset, the 7750 eye 4 is able to deliver HD 7 1 surround sound independently to four displays via the four interfaces on the card. Gone is the need for multiple PCs and cards to provide audio to multiple displays and you don't need a 3 5mm mini-DIN cable to connect to the motherboard. This attention to detail to support business application use via the mini DisplayPort interface is unmatched by any other graphics card manufacturer.

<span>I decided to add a third monitor to my server and after much research, chose the VisionTek Products Radeon 7750 SFF 2GB GDDR5 card.  I installed it and had difficulties loading the included driver on the included CD so I defaulted to Windows 10 drivers.  2 weeks late I discovered that Amazon had dropped the price on this card by nearly $70 so I called customer service.  I was told the only way to get the card for the lower price was to return the original card and reorder it at the lower price.  This is exactly what I did and the next day my new card arrived.  Imagine my surprise when I opened the box and discovered that the new card was a totally different card.  I immediately called the manufacturer to determine what was going on.<br/><br/>I was told that my original card was an older card that had been replaced by the newer version.  In the enclosed pictures the older card has the letter V on the fan while the newer version includes the entire name VisionTek on the fan.  The newer version also came with updated drivers on a CD.  After installing the newer card I tried loading the new drivers and discovered that the Window 10 drivers worked better than the ones provided by VisionTek.  I also discovered the next day that there were video driver updates available from Microsoft that were dated less than 2 weeks earlier.<br/><br/>Thus, I am now running 3 monitors on my VisionTek 7750 graphic card utilizing Windows 10's latest drivers and loving the enhanced speed and versatility of 3 monitors.</span>

<span>I had to spend about 3-4 hours just trying to get the drivers installed. It's a VisionTek product but AMD supplies the drivers, I'm not sure why this is. AMD didn't list the driver for this model, but the auto-detect software can find it. Unfortunately, I had to go through hours of troubleshooting steps with windows just to get the drivers installed. Once I finally had them installed, I was able to setup my 4 monitor display, no problems.<br/><br/>Others already mentioned it, but just in case - if you're using any Windows OS, make sure you have at least two active display outputs. Displayport is already active, but if you're using VGA, DVI-I, DVI-D or HDMI you're going to have to get at least two "active" adapters.</span>

<span>I am a loyal VisonTek customer in terms of a good quality video card for 3, 4 or 6 monitors.  I have about 15 of them on various office machines. I have one 6 monitor, two 4 monitor and one 6 monitor cards.  They are great for a business environment needing multiple monitors. For gaming there are more powerful  alternatives.<br/><br/> However they are lacking in their connectors. Their 3 monitor card has a flimsy 3 way splitter that easily bends the socket or breaks the screws so I was delighted when their 4 and 6 monitor cards had mini-Display-Port (MDP) sockets.  The problem is their adapters.  Most monitors today have HDMI and DVI ports only. Few have Display Ports (DP).  The good news is that their ports are Active.  Active ports have power to support circuitry that converts on port type to another. However their 6 monitor card provides only MDP-to-DP adapters and their 4 monitor card only includes two MDP-to-DP and two MDP-to-DVI adapters.  If like most of us you have HDMI monitors, you have to buy their Active MDP-to-HDMI adapters or a quality aftermarket one.<br/><br/>Their tech support department which is pretty responsive by email said their cards will support two adapters or cables that are not active. A non-active adapter such as a cable with HDMI on one side and DP on the other side will work but only for 2 of the 4 or 6 monitors respectively depending on the card.<br/><br/>There are a couple other things.<br/>- They make these wonderfully engineered adapters with a screw-down screw so that they do not pull out of the card but the screw-down adapters are only available with a new card. They do not sell the screw-down versions à la carte and the Active MDP-to-HDMI which do not ship with the cards are not manufactured with screw downs. So if you have 4 or 6 of those plugged in on the respective board.<br/>- If you decide to go DVI, you can at least have one screw-down adapter.  Having one is a huge help because you can zip tie the others that have no screw-down to it and keep them from falling out of the board.  However DVI plugs are not particularly good for snaking up the pipe on a multi-monitor stand.<br/><br/>My suggestion to VisionTek is to sell the screw down adapters à la carte and ship the units with all MDP to HDMI adapters or sell them with 2-3 HDMI ports (because 4-6 won’t fit on most cards) that support “Y” cables. That way 2 HDMI ports with 2 “Y”s would support 4 monitors and and 3 HDMI ports with 3 “Y”s would support 6 monitors respectively.<br/><br/>So the bottom line is that if you want to do it right, you need 4 or 6 Active MDP-to-HDMI adapters preferably Vision Tek brand.  So plan on spending $25 each or $100 extra for the 4 monitor card and $150 extra for the 6 video card.  Also plan on having no screw downs; a great feature gone to waste.</span>

<span>I’m going to write a detailed technical review here in the hopes that I can save somebody some time. My own mistakes cost me about two days.<br/>For personal reasons I recently consolidated three offices into one. Two of the offices had double monitors, one high-definition and one VGA. With the consolidation I ended up with many monitors and more computers that I have hands to operate. I decided to dispose of the computers and take the monitors and build myself a machine that had three high-definition monitors attached to it. I bought this card. First the basics. Digital standards for monitor video are HDMI, DisplayPort, and DVI. All these digital standards will run high-definition monitors well. The analog standard for video is VGA. I wasn’t happy with the quality of VGA with a large high definition widescreen monitor so I bought this card to get digital outputs for all the monitors. Now here’s where it gets tricky. DisplayPort is inherently an “active” standard, HDMI and DVI are inherently “passive.” Only two passive devices are allowed by Microsoft Windows. Since I do not own Displayport monitors, only HDMI and DVI, I had to purchase an “Active” mini-DisplayPort to DVI adapter to make my third monitor work. The first two monitors worked with mini-Displayport to HDMI adapters that were passive. The mini-Displayport to DVI adapters that are included with this card are passive.<br/>I still don’t understand the difference between active and passive adapters except the active adapters are about twice as expensive. But if you are like me you will need to add an active adapter to replace the passive DVI adapter found in the box.<br/><br/>By the way I figured this out by calling this company’s tech support and they answered my question about 60 seconds. They gave me a part number I put it in Amazon and ordered the part before I even hung up the phone. This company’s technical support is wonderful, and a time when that is getting harder to find. It’s great that a company can answer the phone with a real person who fixes your problem right away.<br/><br/>Other things about this card is it does come with a full size back panel adapter. You can change that out in about one minute. It was very easy to install, Windows found everything right away and it worked and now I have a browser in one display, word processor in the second, and email in the third. The fan noise is minimal.
