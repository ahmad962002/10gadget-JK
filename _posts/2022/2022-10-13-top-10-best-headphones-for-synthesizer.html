<span>Was expecting these to be semi-decent, but am really blown away. The only complaints I have are that the mechanism by which the ear cups collapse is a little difficult and to collapse the ear cups is not a very smooth process. I could definitely see this being the first thing to break down after regular use. Another thing is that the cord is just too dang long. I don’t know what the deal is with headphone cord lengths. Cords seem to be either so short you can’t even move away from where they’re plugged in (Apple) or they make them exceptionally long to where you’re constantly having to move it out of the way, getting tangled up in it, etc. Why can’t they find a happy medium?!<br/><br/>I really have no other complaints though. Time will tell, but so far so good. I am definitely happy with my purchase.</span>

<span>I have a degree in Recording Arts, and prefer using headphones over speakers for monitors.<br/><br/>I am comparing these to the Sony MDR7506, which is generally considered the hands-down best cans under $100. Source sound is Tool.<br/><br/>These are definitely on par with the Sonys.<br/><br/>The bass is slightly better: More bass, but artificially so. Slightly too much bass, but not overwhelming. A little better than the Sonys, but cancelled out slightly by overdoing it a little.<br/>The soundstage, separation, openness, however you want to call it, is definitely lacking as compared to the Sonys. FAR tighter, more like listening in an acoustically well-designed closet, whereas the Sonys sound incredibly natural, almost hyper-natural. This works out as a small advantage in some instances, but overall a net negative.<br/>Physical comfort is awesome. Like wearing a pair of your favorite slippers on your ears. No long-term fatigue. The cord is a little annoying in its length, but I'm mostly happy with it (better too long than too short).<br/>Sound cancellation is a fraction of a hair better than the Sonys, which is to say incredible. I can block out all but the loudest sounds, with virtually no impact on what I'm listening to. It's really nice that both of them allow flipping the ear cup 180* without the need to take the whole set off or shift them on my ears so that I can hear The Boss or The Spawn try to converse with me.<br/>All other aspects seem comparable between the two. Same airy highs. Same overall excellent sound. Same incredible comfort.<br/><br/>If you're looking for a tight, modestly bass-accented, noise-cancelling pair of cans for a great price, you'll be incredibly happy with these. Insane bang-for-the-buck value: like a $120 pair of cans. But for $5 more, you can get a $250 pair of cans with the Sonys (just don't expect the bass bump).</span>

<span>The Audio Technica ATH-M30x are excellent sounding headphones in the sub $100 range. I'm using the M30x as a second pair of headphones to listen to music and when watching movies or TV shows on an iPhone, iPad, or through an AV receiver. I wanted headphones that would sound great, be well built, be portable, and yet be affordably priced. In those regards, the M30x delivers.<br/><br/>The M30x is a nicely designed successor to the popular M30 headphones which they are replacing. I really like Audio Technica's styling update for the M30x, giving it a look similar to the iconic M50 and newer M50x headphones. Like the M50 and M50x, the M30x now features a collapsible design for space saving portability. Both of those are welcome changes from the dated looking and clunkier M30. A few months back I purchased a pair of M30 headphones, used them for a couple of weeks before returning them, and then purchased the M50 headphones. The design and feel of the M30x is much improved from the M30.<br/><br/>-----<br/>SPEC COMPARISON BETWEEN ATH-M30x &amp; ATH-M50x:<br/>The M50 and M30 were the most popular headphones in Audio Technica's Professional Studio Monitor Headphone lineup so my guess is that the M50x and M30x will be also so I've written a spec comparison between models.<br/><br/>1. The M30x has a 40mm driver compared to a 45mm driver in the M50x.<br/>2. The M30x has a frequency response of 15-22,000Hz compared to 15-28,000Hz with the M50x.<br/>3. The M30x has a maximum input power of 1300mW at 1kHz compared to 1600mW at 1kHz with the M50x.<br/>4. The M30x has a sensitivity of 96dB compared to 99dB with the M50x.<br/>5. The M30x has an impedance of 47 ohms compared to 38 ohms with the M50x.<br/>6. The M30x weighs 7.8oz compared to 10oz with the M50x.<br/>7. The M30x has a built in cable compared to detachable cables with the M50x. The straight cables are both 9.8'.<br/><br/>With a higher sensitivity, lower impedance, and higher maximum input power  the M50x are a little easier to drive, are a little louder, and can handle more power before clipping than the M30x.<br/><br/>-----<br/>COMPARING AUDIO TECHNICA's PROFESSIONAL STUDIO MONITOR HEADPHONE LINEUP:<br/>If looking at other models in Audio Technica's lineup, the M20x, M30x, and M40x all have 40mm drivers whereas the M50x has 45mm drivers. All have a frequency response on the low end of 15Hz but as the headphone models get better so do the higher end of the frequency response, 20,000Hz with the M20x up to 28,000Hz with the M50x. The M40x and M50x feature detachable cables whereas the cable in the M20x and M30x is built in to the headphones. The M20x isn't collapsible while all the other models are. When examining sensitivity, impedance, and maximum input power, as the models get better the headphones tend to increase in dB's, become easier to drive with a lower impedance, and are able to handle more power before clipping.<br/><br/>-----<br/>SOUND QUALITY OF M30x &amp; COMPARISON TO M50:<br/>The M30x offers excellent sound quality for its price. The headphones produce a rich, clean, and detailed sound with a good amount of bass. I'm really impressed with the sound they are able to produce.<br/><br/>Having the M50, I was able to do a comparison between the two headphones. Since many reviewers who own both the M50 and M50x headphones state that the two models sound identical, my sound comparison between the M50 and M30x should provide a good comparison in sound between the M30x and newer M50x headphones.<br/><br/>The M50 headphones are a little louder. They produce better bass as a result of the 45mm drivers compared the 40mm drivers in the M30x. The sound from the M50's is also fuller and has better separation. You do get what you pay for but when considering sound to price the M30x offers great bang for your buck.<br/><br/>-----<br/>PROS:<br/>1. Produce a rich, clean, and detailed sound with good bass.<br/>2. Affordably priced, great bang for your buck.<br/>3. Comfortable to wear.<br/>4. Attractive design and lightweight.<br/>5. Collapsible for space saving portability. When collapsed they are noticeably smaller than my M50's collapsed.<br/>6. Comes with protective carrying pouch and 1/4" adapter for headphone plug. The 3.5mm plug allows the M30x to plug into smartphones, tablets, laptops, and desktop computers. The 1/4" adapter allows the headphones to plug into receivers, mixers, and other audio equipment.<br/><br/>CONS:<br/>1. The "L" &amp; "R" indicators for the cans are inside the headband area and are hard to see in dim lit areas. I much prefer their placement on the can swivel mechanism with the M50/M50x. I know its minor especially if you just remember that the cable comes out of the left side but I thought I'd mention it.<br/><br/>-----<br/>SUMMARY:<br/>The ATH-M30x headphones continue Audio Technica's legacy of producing amazing headphones. At the price point of the M30x, they are very hard to beat. If you are looking for a pair of headphones that sound great, are well built, are portable, and yet are affordably priced as I was, I highly recommend the M30x. If considering other Audio Technica models I recommend spending a little extra money and purchasing the M30x over the M20x. The collapsible design is very nice and the M30x allows almost double the maximum input power than the M20x. If sound quality is your concern over price, the M50x is superior with better bass, separation, and a fuller sound. The build quality is also nicer with the M50x. My M50's feel sturdier, the headband extender feels more durable, and I like the swivel feature of the M50 cans. That's not to take away from the M30x because they are well built headphones for the price.</span>

<blockquote><em><div class="a-row a-spacing-small review-data"><span class="a-size-base review-text review-text-content" data-hook="review-body">
<span>I get easily distracted by my environment, especially sounds, so I needed noise cancelling headphones. This was my main reason for looking into buying these, so I’m not much help when it comes to audio quality specifics, though the sound quality does seem great to me.<br/><br/>My AirPod pros are nice and quick to connect and use. The noise cancelling works pretty well since they sit in the ear, but they can get uncomfortable. I wanted over the ear headphones that were noise cancelling, comfortable, could be wired or wireless, and had good sound quality. These Sony ones are exactly what I was looking for.<br/><br/>I’ve tried so many inexpensive noise cancelling headphones, but they simply didn’t work well. I could always hear my surroundings, which would distract from my work and make me far less productive than I could’ve been. Sound quality was always meh, and most were either bluetooth or wired when I needed both. My pc’s bluetooth isn’t great, so I wanted the option to plug and listen, while still being able to use wireless with my devices.<br/><br/>While the noise cancelling isn’t so perfect that I can’t hear anything around me 100%, it’s enough that when listening to music or whatever audio, it drowns out most noise enough for me to concentrate. Some external noises can still come through that I think are just higher pitched, but these Sony headphones are leaps and bounds better than the others I’ve tried, which I’d hope for at this price.<br/><br/>They’ve improved my ability to complete my work and do tasks so much better for the last few months that I’ve had them. Even wearing them in crowded areas has been nice, and I’m not trading sound quality for noise cancelling or vice versa.<br/><br/>Although they’re expensive, they’ve been worth the price for me, and not having to use AirPods all the time has been a huge plus and a nice relief for my ears.</span>

<span>I left a lengthy review of the Jabra Evolve2 85 (E285) vs Bose Quiet Comfort 35 II (QC35II) vs Bose Noise Cancelling 700 (B700) vs Sony WH-1000XM4 (SX4) (in order of when I received them) for the E285. Since that review is out there, I'll reduce this one only to E285 and SX4.<br/><br/>Microphone and Playback<br/>The E285 was notably better than the SX4, as evidenced by my recordings while drumming. It’s neck and neck as far as clarity of voice goes.<br/><br/>Akin to the E285, the SX4 are quite good as far as pick-up goes. But unfortunately, they were a little too good (or simply worse at distinguishing background noise). A co-worker and I had a Zoom meeting with ourselves in the same closet (to maximize productivity), switching between the headsets. Whoever had the E285 could hear themselves through the headset. At first, I thought it was because of the function where you hear yourself through the headset. But alas, upon one of us leaving the room, the echo went away. This meant the SX4 was picking up the other’s voice! The main killer of the SX4 is that you have no way to mute yourself from the headset. As a pair of headphones to be used in the office, this is crucial. You never know when someone may decide to butt in your closet (or office, for most people) and shout “HHHHEEEYYYY!!”. In contrast, the E285 offers two ways to protect yourself from such intrusions – by raising the boom arm or by pressing the button on the boom arm, leaving you to look down simply in resignation at said co-worker without having disrupted the meeting. The one drawback with the E285 is that sometimes the first word or two don’t quite make it through, so you may develop a stutter of your introduction. “I’m Jason – oh – I’M JASON – oh you can hear me now? I’m Jason”. Good news is, you shan’t be soon forgotten. Despite this, it’s more favorable than not being able to mute myself, though I can understand disagreement with this point. Win for E285. Runner up is SX4.<br/><br/>Audio Output - DISCLAIMER - I'm not an audiophile<br/>Both associated apps come with decent equalizers (unlike Bose). Honestly, it was difficult to tell the difference between the E285 and SX4. I think the amount of bass you get is comparable, however I think the SX4 is capable of producing an ever-so-slightly louder sound. Win for SX4. Runner up is E285.<br/><br/>Brand<br/>Jabra: doesn’t require my location. Instead, it lets me know if I desire to give it my location, it will use it to locate my headphones. No, but thank you for giving me an actual choice!<br/><br/>Sony: same as Jabra, though with a caveat. The SX4 offers more utility when given Location permission, which will be addressed later on. They were not pertinent to me, however, so my location remains an enigma for Sony and Jabra (and Bose). Tie between E285 and SX4.<br/><br/>ANC<br/>When playing on a drumpad, the E285 did a noticeably better job than the other headsets. It sounds like the pad is being muffled (which is what I’m looking for), whereas the others don’t quite succeed. The E285 does a better job with impact noises (or maybe it’s just higher frequencies) than the other headsets, though the SX4 is perfectly satisfactory.<br/><br/>In addition, the hear-through function of the E285 is awesome. It almost makes it sound like you’re not wearing them (tested at maximum hear-through). The SX4 has essentially the same feature, with an added “Focus on voice” option. I couldn’t tell a difference when that was on/off. Besides that, the SX4 didn’t do as good a job at allowing sound through as the E285. Win for E285. Runner up is SX4.<br/><br/>Connectivity<br/>The E285 and SX4 have longer ranges than the QC35II. The E285, most of the time, reconnects automatically when coming back into range. Unfortunately, I don't remember specifics about the SX4. SX4 and E285 have a 3.5 mm jack. Why doesn’t the B700? Because it sucks.<br/><br/>Double-connection to my PC (independent of range): E285 is easier because it’s just plug-and-play, no downloads or “connecting”. The QC35II and SX4 are only Bluetooth, so you have to do the standard “add device”, etc. One annoying thing about the SX4 is you have to use the app to establish a Bluetooth connection to another device. Not a big deal, but for comparison’s sake, the E285 is better. An added feature of the Jabra is Jabra Direct, a software you can download to better manage your Jabra. It gives you a few more options and is worth using, in this writer’s humble opinion.<br/><br/>Response time: The SX4 is the fastest, though we’re talking minute (not 60 seconds) differences. The E285 is on the cusp of being slow enough to be annoying, but not quite. The E285 and SX4 have the cool feature of pausing media when the headphones are removed from your skull. Again, the E285 feel lack-luster in comparison because they take approximately 4 M-I-S-S-I-S-S-I-P-I seconds to pause, whereas the SX4 is half that time. For the E285, I’ve noticed the ear detection only works properly when playing music from your phone and not the PC. When using it with the PC, if I remove the headphones, the music will pause as it should. But it doesn’t resume when I put them back on. If I pause the music with the button, then remove the headset, it resumes. Again, cool feature, but needs work, especially when using it with the PC. So SX4 is better about ear detection (presumably because it's laser-assisted).<br/><br/>App connectivity: some issues with E285. Some issues with SX4. LOTS of issues with B700 (Bose Music). Unfortunately, apps are prone to some bugs every now and then. I can’t say which of the two (Sony/Jabra) had more, so neither bothered me much. Winner is SX4 (better media response time). Runner up is E285.<br/><br/>Voice Assistant<br/>The E285 and SX4 worked exactly as expected. No setup or anything, I just pushed the button and my assistant came up. The caveat for the E285 is you have to pull down the boom arm to use the feature (you can still press the action button with the boom arm up and have the assistant prompt, but because the arm is up, the microphone is off so it’s pointless). Tie between E285 and SX4.<br/><br/>Controls<br/>On the E285, the buttons take up little surface area and are rather flat. Muting is done with the E285 by simply raising or lowering the boom mic. In contrast, the SX4 doesn't have any way to mute yourself.<br/><br/>After just a little use of the “touchless” controls (B700 and SX4), I can see their usefulness. It’s certainly easier to play/pause music and use the Voice Assistant (which is no easier to actually setup because Bose sucks). Changing volume is annoying because every click up/down requires an extra swipe. As debilitating as this is, one would not likely be changing by a bunch of increments at a time. After more use of the touchless controls, I much prefer the them over the physical ones. Win for SX4. Runner up is E285.<br/><br/>Comfort and Style<br/>Comfort is pretty much a tie between E285 and SX4. I've worn both for hours and hours without any issue. But I prefer the style of the SX4 - it just feels more premium. Winner is SX4. Runner up is E285.<br/><br/>Extra<br/>The E285 has the hear-through feature, which I really like because I use ANC only when there are sounds I actively don’t want to listen to, like from mine or my roommate’s drumming, running water, laundry, phone call, or pooping with the fan on. Other than those times, I want some awareness of my surroundings because there’s nothing more frustrating than trying to get the attention of someone with headphones on (especially at work). In addition, the E285 and SX4 have ear detection (discussed previously). The E285 has a great way of handling multiple calls with its huge button on the right cuff. You can switch between two phone calls by putting one on hold and accept/end/reject calls using it. This is RARELY used, but it's cool.<br/><br/>Issues<br/>There’s some variability with functionality of the Google Assistant with the E285. At the very least, the action button on the arm activates the assistant. But sometimes the input for said assistant is on the phone rather than the arm. Most of the time it works as expected. I think the additional connection to the PC adds complexity that needs to be vetted out for seamless functionality for the E285.<br/><br/>Final verdict, best to worst: E285, SX4 (killer - no mute function, worse hear-through), QC35II (killers - older BT connection, worse audio, poor ANC). Literally wouldn't buy B700.<br/><br/>UPDATE: It's been several weeks since I returned all but the Jabra Evolve2 85 (I use it 3-10 hours every single day) and my final rating is four stars, same as the SX4. When the E285 works, it's great. But it doesn't work all the time, unfortunately. I can't say the same for the SX4 since it was ultimately returned. I ended up choosing the E285 over the SX4 because it has an edge when it comes to office use, for one main reason - you can't mute yourself on the SX4. But if muting yourself directly from your headset isn't important to you and you're not typically in a noisy environment during calls, then I would honestly recommend the Sony WH-1000XM4.</span>

<span>In passive mode, the sound quality is all over the place, resulting in some of the worst headphones I've ever used in this price bracket. In active mode, it's... decent, with boomy, mildly unclean bass; acceptable mids; and messy but listenable highs. It is very responsive to EQ past sub-bass range, though you can crank up the already boomy mid-bass if that's your thing and it can get pretty loud. At about 70–80% volume, the amp begins to distort, and at 100% volume the distortion is highly audible and really crunches the highs and muddies the bass. There is also a noticeable frequency response and volume difference between the cups, likely due to the indentation for the sensor array inside the left cup; if you aren't listening for it, it is still noticeable sometimes, but it fades to the background if you are using the noise canceling or are otherwise occupied.<br/>The ambient sound feature does not pick up outside sounds very clearly. If you're using the Sony | Headphones Connect app, you can enable a "voice mode" for ambient sound that cuts out the bass and boosts vocal range with EQ, but it cannot be turned on with the toggle buttons on the headphones themselves or when connected to PC, making it tedious to enable without the automatic switching feature that tracks your location and habits to enable it when it thinks you need it. The noise canceling however is truly top of its class and easily removes 80–90% of outside noise, and you can't hear anything else if you're playing something. I have noticed that the DSP appears to crank up the bass, either to compensate for the harder-to-remove low-end frequencies or to trick you into thinking the noise canceling is better than it really is in that range.<br/>The ear cup touch controls work fine and I have not had any mis-inputs, though volume up/down steps are too small. You can hold down the up/down slider instead of repeatedly sliding your finger, but the repeat delay is very long and it takes forever to adjust to what you want.<br/>The headphones are fairly adjustable to different head shapes, but if you have a reeeally big head/ears or lots of hair it may be difficult. The headband padding is a bit hard but the headphones are so light you can't feel it. The closed cups have no ventilation so your ears stay warm, and I imagine it would get sweaty in warmer weather.<br/>The headphones can fold flat and can sit around your neck comfortably. The auto-pause when it detects you remove them, and the 15 minute auto-off means you don't ever need to bother turning them off explicitly, just take them off your head and put them down. Their ability to fold also works great for stowing them, and you can fit them into any bag. The included carry case is a bit bulkier than it probably needs to be, but it's still small enough to fit in even a medium sized purse, and it does have room for cables and small accessories.<br/>The mic quality is pretty bad and doesn't pick up your voice well. What it does pick up well is everything around you. You'd think Sony's engineers could have used the ambient sound mics to dampen outside noise while focusing on your voice, but it unfortunately doesn't do that. Call sound quality in general takes a major dive due to the protocol it uses under the hood; it halves the sample rate and sounds like a cheap dollar store headset.<br/>The battery is massive; I charged it to 90% once I received it a few days ago and have not had to charge it since with daily listening. Rtings.com got 37 hours out of one charge, far past the advertised duration.<br/><br/>Overall all of the features work to an acceptable level, except passive mode sound quality. If you are buying these for the battery longevity, small stowable size, ease of use, and noise isolation and canceling, they're a great package. Great for traveling. Would not recommend for even casual listening, get a good closed back pair like the Hifiman HE-R9 + Bluemini R2R wireless dongle. If you need to make important calls or want headphones for conference calls or online meetings, these will work, but it won't be pleasant—get a dedicated conference headset.<br/><br/>If you really insist on these for more active listening situations, do yourself a favor and get the AutoEQ preset for them as a baseline, and tweak to your ears. I also recommend a -1dB loss on the left earcup to help offset the response difference, though it's an approximation and not perfect and differences in track volume will make this obvious. With these changes, passive mode is at least bearable.</span>

<span>I've owned the Sony 1000XM3, H900N, and the Bose QC35 II.  I couldn't wait for the XM4 to come out because of the multipoint Bluetooth (I'll get to that a little later).  The sound is great once it's been adjusted, and the noise cancelling in the XM4 is better than both the XM3 and the QC35 II.  However, there are quite a few things that are very poorly implemented and basically unusable.<br/><br/>Sound: A-<br/>First off the XM4, XM3, and H900N all have better and brighter sound than the QC35 II.  Out of the box, the sound is a little dull and the mids / vocals are a little mushy.  With the XM4, I needed to tweak it in the Headphones app using the EQ to get it to the place that I wanted it, but once it was there, it was great.  A small but pleasing improvement in the XM4 is that the headphone voice announcements are at a much higher quality.  The XM3 announcements are low fidelity and low bandwidth whereas the XM4 headphone voice is very crisp and hi-fi.  Sony also replaced the high-pitched beep with a slightly longer but more pleasant sounding bell for feedback.  However, I actually prefer the beep because it's faster.<br/><br/>Noise cancelling: A-<br/>When I first put on the XM4 and turned them on, I was surprised by the audible hiss from the noise cancelling.  It wasn't present with the XM3.  I think this is because they have cranked up the noise cancelling in the XM4.  I have air purifiers running in my house, and the XM4 does a better job of cancelling out the noise almost completely.  The XM3 still has some leakage.  The XM3 is just as good as the Bose in noise cancellation, and the XM4, though a little hissy and is a slightly bit better.  The drawback to this is that it can feel like it's creating a slight pressure in my head that increases over time.<br/><br/>Multipoint Bluetooth: F<br/>This was the feature I had been waiting for.  The awesome noise cancellation and sound of the XM3, but with the ability to stream two devices at once.  FAIL!  I had been eagerly anticipating this and checking daily for the release of the XM4.  I was so excited to get them...only to be sorely disappointed.  Though the device will connect to two devices simultaneously, it actually DISCONNECTS when one of the two devices is activated.  So it's not true multipoint Bluetooth.  Sony advertises that the multipoint Bluetooth is seamless.  This is true if they mean you don't have to press any buttons to disconnect from a device.  However, the way it manages connections is very poor.  I have to put the XM4 into pairing mode if I've connected to my phone in order for it to play audio from my computer.  If I don't do this, it doesn't recognize that my computer is playing sound, and then doesn't stream the sound.  Even though it shows on my computer as connected, it doesn't show up in my sound options as a device that I can use for audio.  I have to turn them off, put them into pairing mode, and then reconnect in order to get the sound to play.  If a call comes in on my phone, the headphones actually disconnect from the computer to switch to the call - and the headphone voice announces that they have disconnected, super annoying and not seamless.  With the QC35 II, I could use both at the same time, with the phone being connected at the low-quality voice mode and my computer at the high quality music mode.  They had 2 years to get the multipoint Bluetooth right and they totally failed.  So it ends up that I have to turn the XM4 off and re-pair them just like I had to with the XM3.  I've had to do this a number of times, and I haven't quite figured out all the exact situations where I have to re-pair them.  With the XM3, I knew if I wanted to switch devices, I would have to do it.  But with the XM4, I haven't put my finger on all of them just yet.  At any rate, the switching of devices is very clunky and definitely not worth upgrading for.  I have $40 headphones that implement multipoint Bluetooth better than the XM4. I'm stunned and disappointed that Sony hasn't been able to get multipoint Bluetooth to work right.<br/><br/>Comfort: A<br/>Compared to the XM3, the XM4 are slightly softer and a bit more comfortable right when I put them on.  The XM3 are still pretty comfortable, but the earpads are definitely firmer and a little tighter.<br/><br/>Controls: B<br/>I totally prefer the actual buttons on the QC35 II to the touch controls.  Sometimes if I want to change the volume and I slide my finger at a slightly off-angle, it will skip tracks instead.  It's a small annoyance.  On the plus side, the physical buttons do make a fairly audible click that travels through the headphone, whereas the touch controls are a little quieter.<br/><br/>In-call: D<br/>One thing the Bose QC35 II does is that when I'm on a call, it knows to automatically turn on ambient sound mode so I can hear myself talking.  Neither the XM3 nor the XM4 figured out that this is a useful and great feature, so they don't do it.  If I want it, I have to press the button to switch to it, listen to the announcement, and then it comes on.  Then when I'm done, I have to press the button and wait for it to go into NC off, ambient sound off, and then press the button again and wait for the announcement that the NC is once again activated.  Super slow and awkward and unusable.  So instead, I pull one of the earcups off my ear so I can hear myself speak.  When I first was using the Sony's for calls, I was finding that my voice was tired and my throat sore at the end of the day.  Someone told me that I talked really loud when I was on the phone.  I didn't even know this because the headphones do a really great job of keeping outside sound out, so I was talking at a level so I could hear myself when I was wearing them.  I asked Sony support about this, and the headphones just don't do this.  Fail.<br/><br/>Auto-mute: F<br/>Sony created a feature where the headphones will automatically mute the audio source if it detects that you're talking.  Nice in concept - terrible in practice.  I just turned it off and left it off.  If I'm listening to music and sneeze or make a noise, the headphones will interrupt what I'm listening to and mute it for the amount of time I've specified in the app - 15 seconds is the shortest amount of time.  So I have to wait for it to unmute so that I can continue listening.  What's even more annoying is when I'm using the auxiliary cable in wired mode - again, this is because the multipoint Bluetooth implementation is such a pain and sucks, if I'm on a video conference and I have the headphones on to use the noise cancelling, if I talk, it mutes the audio stream for 15 seconds so I can't hear what anyone in the conference is saying.  So I then have to turn the headphones off in order to interact with the conference in any meaningful way.<br/><br/>Miscellaneous:<br/>I don't understand why Sony doesn't just include a headphone cable with a microphone.  With all the video-conferencing I do, and the terrible multipoint Bluetooth implementation, I end up using the auxiliary headphone cable a lot.  It's much faster and convenient for me to switch the plug from my computer to my phone rather than dealing with the horrible Bluetooth switching.  The auxiliary cable Sony provides doesn't have a microphone, so I have to hold my phone close to my mouth if I'm using the cable.  I ended up buying an auxiliary cable with a microphone and some playback controls on it and it works great.  Here's another really poorly thought-out thing: upon pairing the new XM4 with the app, it gives me the opportunity to give feedback on the headphones.  This is only upon the initial startup of the headphones.  How on earth can I give meaningful feedback about the headphones on my first use?  It took me to Sony's site to do the survey, and I decided I would complete it later, only to discover that it had timed out, and now I'm not able to provide feedback through that mechanism.<br/><br/>Conclusion:<br/>All the hype about multipoint Bluetooth is a big letdown with the real product.  If that's the reason you're thinking about upgrading, don't do it.  The rest of it is pretty similar to the XM3.  Some nice little features added, but nothing earth shattering.  The new features on paper were everything that I wanted that was missing from the XM3.  In practice, the XM4 implementation of these things just did not hit the mark.  I soooo wanted to love these headphones, so that I could stop looking for headphones.  As it stands, they totally weren't worth the upgrade and I will most likely be sending these back.  Sadly, they are not as advertised.</span>

<span>I decided to buy 4 sets of Noise Cancelling headphones and then send back the 3 loser (with the intention of giving objective feedback).<br/><br/>***My primary priorities were noise cancellation and comfort.  My secondary priorities were sound quality and user friendliness.  And finally style.<br/><br/>The four headphones that I compared were...<br/>Bose 700’s<br/>Sony WH1000XM4’s<br/>Bose 350’s<br/>Sony WH1000XM3’s<br/><br/>In short, I ended up keeping the Bose 700s (and that was an easy decision based on my priorities).<br/><br/>I have a little bit of bigger head and found the 700s much more comfortable than any of the others...by far!  My wife has a smaller head and she tried the 700s and found that they didn’t fit her head well and preferred the Sony XM4s.  However I can wear the Bose 700s for multiple hours and they feel great!!!<br/><br/>I found the noise Cancellation to be equal in quality with the Bose 700s and the Sony XM4s.  But I found the Sony XM4s to create a slight uncomfortable noise/feeling.  Some people could find this troubling but it wasn’t a big deal for me.<br/><br/>I found the Bose 700s and Sony XM4s have slightly better ability for noise cancellation than the Bose 350s and the Sony XM 3’s.  However the Bose 700’s allow me to push a button to 3 different noise cancelling settings which is kind of nice.<br/><br/>When it comes to sound quality the Sony XM4’s win by a long shot.  And if I were only going to wear these for a few hours I would probably have bought the Sony XM4s.  However I tend to travel internationally on flights that are 8+ hours long and so the comfort was more significant than the sound quality because the Bose 700s are still very good in their sound quality and I can adjust the EQ to my preference.<br/><br/>The final decision maker for me was the user friendliness.  The Bose 700s were so easy to set up and use.  (This is also why I prefer apple products...simplicity).  I found the Sony’s to be much more complicated, confusing and the touch sensors to be a bit clumsy and less responsive.  I also found the Bose 700’s very easy to quickly put away in their storage case (which is a nice hard case for travel).<br/><br/>The Bose 350s were also very simple to use and the sound quality was decent.  But their comfort and noise cancelling was lesser than the Sony XM4S and the Bose 700s.<br/><br/>The Sony XM3s are once again better in sound quality and between the Sony XM3s and the Bose 350s I would go with the Sony XM3s.  Both fit on my head similarly...so equally uncomfortable for long term wear (great for my wife with a smaller head but not me with a bigger head).<br/><br/>Obviously I’m not considering price in any of these comparisons.  Because comfort was a much bigger priority to me than price...I needed something that would be worn comfortably for multiple hours despite the cost.  If you’re looking for cost effectiveness the Sony XM3s or Bose 350s are the way to go (so long as they fit your head like they do my wife’s)<br/><br/>For perspective my head is 23 inches round.  My wife’s head is 20 inches.  Our ears are average/not big so our ears fit just fine in all of the headphones listed above.<br/><br/>When it comes to style the Bose 700s are incredibly sleek and modern...very stylish...especially the grey ones (which is what I bought).  We found the grey Bose 700’s and Bose 350’s are much better looking than the Sony XM4 or XM3s.  In fact I found the black Sony’s the only color I’d consider.  So if color is something you’re considering and you want something besides black then both sets of the Bose are the way to go.  But the 700’s take it to a whole new stratosphere and my teenage daughter wants to wear them (but they’re not leaving my head and I don’t think they would fit her very well as she has a similar size head as my wife).  If I were buying some for her, I’d buy the grey Bose 350’s.<br/><br/>Finally all of these have relatively strong batteries.  The Sony’s are probably better overall but the Bose 700’s charge quickly and I can easily get 20+ hours of listening out of them before needing to charge them.  Fifteen minutes of charging will get me a few hours.<br/><br/>Let me be clear, all 4 of these headphones are REALLY nice!  And so you need to consider your priorities and then choose accordingly and I think you will then be happy with whatever route you go.</span>

<span>I left a lengthy review comparing the Jabra Evolve2 85 (E285) vs Bose Quiet Comfort 35 II (QC35II) vs Bose Noise Cancelling 700 (B700) vs Sony WH-1000XM4 (SX4) (in order of when I received them) for the E285. With the full review there, I'll keep this one more focused on N700 vs E285. This was almost entirely written up during the week I had all four headsets for direct comparisons.<br/><br/>Microphone and Playback<br/>The B700 was not tested because there were enough other reasons not to even consider them. Win for E285. Runner up is SX4.<br/><br/>Audio Output - DISCLAIMER - I'm not an audiophile<br/>E285 and SX4 audio sound better than the QC35II but primarily because I can use an equalizer and increase bass (obviously this is the most important factor). I couldn’t get the “thump” from the B700 no matter what I tried. The B700 does have an EQ, but it’s far more basic than what Jabra and Sony offer, like a ball point pen vs a fountain pen. Sure, the ball point will get the message across, but one can’t deny the fountain pen its grace as it glides like butter across the page, leaving streaks of variable line widths and drawing you in –sorry, wrong review. Win for SX4. Runner up is E285.<br/><br/>Brand<br/>Bose: wanted my location and would ask for it every time I open the app (and wouldn’t allow usage without accepting beyond the standard Bluetooth connection process). These are headphones. You don’t need my location. There are two different apps and both suck, but the one for B700 is especially awful (Bose Music). Just the first time using the app for setup, it crashed. It periodically failed to detect the headphones, even after the latest firmware instalment. It’s worth mentioning the Bose Music app is far worse than the other Bose app (QC35II uses Bose Connect). I had far too many connectivity issues within the first hour to justify keeping the B700 (yes, I requested a return within an hour).<br/><br/>Jabra: doesn’t require my location. Instead, it lets me know if I desire to give it my location, it will use it to locate my headphones. No, but thank you for giving me an actual choice!<br/><br/>ANC<br/>When playing on a drumpad, the E285 did a noticeably better job than the other headsets. It sounds like the pad is being muffled (which is what I’m looking for), whereas the others don’t quite succeed. Again, B700 was not put through this test because it sucks.<br/><br/>In addition, the hear-through function of the E285 is awesome. The E285 hear-through, which has adjustable levels, almost makes it sound like you’re not wearing them (tested at maximum hear-through). Win for E285. Runner up is SX4.<br/><br/>Connectivity<br/>The E285 and SX4 have longer ranges than the QC35II. The E285, most of the time, reconnects automatically when coming back into range. QC35II, SX4, and E285 have a 3.5 mm jack. Why doesn’t the B700? Because it sucks.<br/><br/>Double-connection to my PC (independent of range): E285 is easier because it’s just plug-and-play, no downloads or “connecting”. Didn’t bother trying the B700 because of the numerous issues with just one connected device. An added feature of the Jabra is Jabra Direct, a software you can download to better manage your Jabra. It gives you a few more options and is worth using, in this writer’s humble opinion.<br/><br/>Response time: the QC35II and B700 have a slightly faster response time when pausing media than the E285. The SX4 is the fastest, though we’re talking minute (not 60 seconds) differences. The E285 is on the cusp of being slow enough to be annoying, but not quite. The E285 and SX4 also have the cool feature of pausing media when the headphones are removed from your skull. Put succinctly, the E285 needs work, especially when using it with the PC. But at least it has it!<br/><br/>App connectivity: some issues with E285. Some issues with SX4. Some issues with QC35II (Bose Connect). LOTS of issues with B700 (Bose Music). Unfortunately, apps are prone to some bugs every now and then; unless you’re Bose Music, in which case you’re a swarm of locusts after a century rest furiously attacking unsuspecting victims taking what was supposed to be a nice meander down the side of the Nile River. Does it remind you of a curse? It should. I succumbed to believing the $400 I used to purchase them came from the time I was standing on a burial ground when my check came through my account. I can’t say which of the two (Sony/Jabra) had more, so neither bothered me much. Winner is SX4 (better media response time). Runner up is E285.<br/><br/>Voice Assistant<br/>Couldn’t even get B700 to work. First off, I have to change the “action” button from ANC control to activate voice assistant (so you can’t have both functionalities at the same time). However, once button mapping was adjusted accordingly, I click the button and it says “open your Google Assistant settings”, with no further instructions. I open the Home app, and once again, no further instructions, so I didn’t get it working. I didn’t spend anymore time on it because in contrast, the E285 and SX4 worked exactly as expected. No setup or anything, I just pushed the button and my assistant came up. The caveat for the E285 is you have to pull down the boom arm to use the feature. Perhaps Bose has better functionality when used with Alexa, but I use Google so I’m not bothering with testing that. Tie between E285 and SX4.<br/><br/>I know this is extremely nit-picky, but the Bose assistant’s voice is far more annoying than Jabra or Sony. She sounds like an actual robot as opposed to someone I wouldn't mind meeting.<br/><br/>Controls<br/>On the E285, the buttons take up little surface area and are rather flat. After just a little use of the “touchless” controls (B700 and SX4), I can see their usefulness. It’s certainly easier to play/pause music and use the Voice Assistant (which is no easier to actually setup because Bose sucks). Changing volume is annoying because every click up/down requires an extra swipe. As debilitating as this is, one would not likely be changing by a bunch of increments at a time. Between the B700 and SX4, I found the pole in the B700 to be much more in the way and therefore the SX4 provides better usability. After more use of the touchless controls, I much prefer the them over the physical ones. Win for SX4. Runner up is E285.<br/><br/>Comfort and Style<br/>While the B700 has the tightest grip, it actually slides off the easiest, I guess because the top band is the slimmest of the pickings. Also, it’s far easier to accidentally move the ear cups because they’re really loosely attached to their sliding pole. Win for QC35II. Runner up is E285/SX4 (just as comfortable). Don't care to spend time rating the B700.<br/><br/>Extra<br/>The E285 has the hear-through feature, which I really like because I use ANC only when there are sounds I actively don’t want to listen to, like from mine or my roommate’s drumming, running water, laundry, phone call, or pooping with the fan on. Other than those times, I want some awareness of my surroundings because there’s nothing more frustrating than trying to get the attention of someone with headphones on (especially at work). In addition, the E285 and SX4 have ear detection (discussed previously). The E285 has a great way of handling multiple calls with its huge button on the right cuff. You can switch between two phone calls by putting one on hold and accept/end/reject calls using it. This is RARELY used, but it's cool.<br/><br/>Issues<br/>B700: flat out sucks with just ONE connection. I’m constantly having to manually re-connect, and not just a simple “re-connect”; I mean force-stopping the app, forgetting the headset from my phone and vice-versa, holding down the Bluetooth button to make the app realize it’s there, allowing my phone to pair, etc. Over and over. Can’t imagine the issues I’d be having if I set it up with two devices.<br/><br/>There’s some variability with the Google Assistant functionality with the E285. At the very least, the action button on the arm activates the assistant. But sometimes the input for said assistant is on the phone rather than the arm. Most of the time it works as expected. I think the additional connection to the PC adds complexity that needs to be vetted out for seamless functionality for the E285.<br/><br/>Final verdict, best to worst: E285, SX4 (killer - no mute function, worse hear-through), QC35II (killers - older BT connection, worse audio, poor ANC). Literally wouldn't buy B700.<br/><br/>UPDATE: It's been several weeks since I returned all but the Jabra Evolve2 85 (I use it 3-10 hours every single day) and my final rating is four stars while I give the B700 one star. When the E285 works, it's great. But it doesn't work all the time, unfortunately. But the B700 was far more aggravating and there was no comparison between it and the other three headphones. Also, Bose REQUIRES your location, which is extremely stupid. They're headphones, you don't need my location. While I ultimately ended up with the E285, if muting yourself directly from your headset isn't important to you and you're not typically in a noisy environment during calls, then I would honestly recommend the Sony WH-1000XM4.</span>

<span>This review is my personal experience using both headphones.  I recently lost my Sony Headphones and decided to buy Bose Headphones.  Here are some differences I have found between all three, and how I feel currently using Bose Headphones.<br/><br/>Make sure you update any headphones firmware, some issues you may experience could be fixed (with any electronic).  Understand that headphones in a warehouse are likely from the year they were manufactured, and first versions of anything tend to be buggy.<br/><br/>PERSONAL USAGE<br/>I use these headphones primarily for work.  I’ve been full time remote for over two years doing software development.  I have ADHD and having noise cancelling headphones is a must to keep my attention on work.  We use mostly Slack and Zoom as our means of communication.  Otherwise, I’m listening to music or the occasional YouTube TV.<br/><br/>PERSONAL PREFERENCES<br/>I really don’t like using in the ear headphones.  They hurt my ears after an hour or so and never were a long-term solution.  Over the ear headphones was what I liked the best since that’s what works for me.  This has been throughout my life, and they tend to fall out.<br/><br/>BEATS – NOT FOR ME OR MY HEAD<br/>My first pair of headphones were Beats Solo.  I was really impressed with wireless headphones in general.  Eventually after the Solos started to fall apart, I decided to get Beats Studio 3.  These worked much better for my head, as these were truly over my year, which I prefer.<br/><br/>The functionality is about the same between the two.  With a lot of usage, the earpieces came worn out and unglued and I had to buy replacements.  Compatible quality replacements are about $30 from different manufacturers.<br/><br/>• Pros – Lots of colors.  Foldable, and buttons are more clicks than touch sensitivity.  Useful when sweating or outdoor use.<br/>• Cons – Quality.  Wore down quickly and were not a long-term solution.  Paying more for royalties to Dr. Dre than quality assurance in general.  Feel cheap.<br/><br/>FIRST DECISION – Sony WH-1000MX3<br/>I was fortunate to try out both headphones from a family member.  I was skeptical about Sony since it wasn’t the name brand Bose was for what I wanted.  I really like how they felt on my head, and they didn’t hurt after wearing them for hours.<br/><br/>There wasn’t a noticeable difference in sound quality.  Features needed matched what I needed at the time and figured there was no point in spending more.  My work-at-home situation was different, and I was at home around 40% of the time.  The case was useful when transporting in my backpack back and forth to work.<br/><br/>Once I transitioned to full time work-at-home, some of the features that I found useful weren’t available on the Sony’s.  One big thing I would like to see is app integration.  Mute / Unmute for Slack and Zoom would really be a great feature.  Understandably, these are headphones, and are limited to what Bluetooth has to offer.<br/><br/>The app is useful, and more powerful with customization than the other two.  I found I used it a couple of times.<br/><br/>Over the three years I’ve used these, the product quality and sound we’re just like day 1.  These headphones seem to be built better than the other two.<br/><br/>• Pros –Very durable and well built.  Sound quality is great and felt good after a day’s work.  Slept with these on a bus trip.  That was my last memory.  Cheaper than the Bose.  Foldable, smaller case.<br/>• Cons – Less features than the Bose.  Misses on some sweet spots.  Harder to see which is left and right when putting them on, but not really a big deal.<br/><br/>SECOND DECISION – Bose Noise Cancelling Headphones 700<br/><br/>Once I realized I may never see my beloved Sony Headphones again, I needed something right away since work call quality was terrible.  Before I pulled the trigger on the same Sony’s, I wanted to look at to what Bose offered that Sony didn’t.  The biggest was a feature to mute / unmute.  When pouring over reviews like this one, that feature was worth paying up.  Since these are new headphones, I am still getting used to the controls.<br/><br/>I’ve only had these for a month.  Was it worth paying up for it?  Honestly, I don’t know yet.  There are more controls on the headphones which I’m figuring out.<br/>So based on a month, here’s what I found<br/>• Pros – Seems like better sound quality.  More features and possible mute integration.<br/>• Cons – Price and unproven personal durability experience.<br/><br/>TLDR / OVERALL REVIEW<br/>I won’t even compare the Beats headphones.  Sony and Bose are a step way above Beats.<br/>METRICS<br/>• Sound Quality – Bose slightly.  My ears are bad, I’m not an audiophobia as others may be.  Spotify is what I listen to primarily.  The slight edge goes to Bose, only because it’s a small enough difference.<br/>• Mute / Unmute – Bose.  The main reason for choosing Bose instead of Sony for my current headphones.<br/>• Noise Cancelling – Leaning towards Bose.  There is customization of three different settings within the Bose app to set up preferences from 0-10.  Sony sort of has the same thing, but not directly.<br/>• Microphone – Sony.  Never had any issues of cutting out or “robo voice”.  Initially I am “cutting out” and “in a wind tunnel” from peers.<br/>• Bose - Multiple Device Connectivity (multiple Bluetooth Connections) was a feature I didn’t even think about.  Bose allows for multiple connections which comes in handy.  I found myself unpairing and pairing devices with Sony.  It was sort of a hassle that seemed unnecessary.  If the Bluetooth source device is off, it should default to another.<br/>• Headset Features, Bose wins.  Although I haven’t had the time to get into what the buttons do, there are more of them.  The buttons themselves seem a little better than the Sony’s.<br/>• Headset Quality – Sony.  I really don’t care for the artsy plastic that goes over the top of your head.  Sony also folds up where Bose doesn’t.  An argument can be made that the Bose are lighter than the Sony’s, but that didn’t matter to me.<br/>• In the box – Sony slightly.  Sony included an airplane adapter where Bose did not.  I prefer the case from Sony than I do from Bose.<br/>• Daily Use – Too Early to determine, likely Sony.  Sony’s headphones were excellent, as of now I haven’t used the Bose headphones.<br/>• Bluetooth Range – Bose decisively.  Bluetooth location hasn’t changed.  Dead spots where I wore my Sony’s didn’t exist with the Bose. There is a little bit of breakup in the headphones in dead spots, but nearly not as much as the Sony’s.<br/>• Companion Application – Bose.  Much more customization of buttons versus Sony.<br/><br/>WINNER – Sony<br/><br/>I’m going to put a disclaimer on this, so take this for what it is.<br/>With my new set of Bose Headphones, there is a problem with the microphone.  Assuming that this was just a fluke, I returned them since they were defective.  So, my review is irrelevant of that from that aspect.<br/><br/>Both are great, I lean Sony just because of the price difference.<br/><br/>I wanted to give the Bose Headphones a little more time before getting a refund and getting the Sony’s again.  Right now, they’re cutting out where Sony rarely did that.  Even in that case, my computer was slow, or the application used went haywire.  That’s something that’s a no-go for me.  I ended up contacting Bose support, went through the normal stuff, is your battery charged, are you far away to a point they created a return ticket for a replacement.  Once sent in, they would give me a new pair within 5 business days.<br/><br/>Fortunately, after writing this review, I ended up finding my missing Sony headphones, which would be what I would have bought instead of a Bose replacement.<br/><br/>As with any review, only you can decide if the extra money for Bose is worth it.  I can see it both ways.  For me, these headphones are for basic usage.  The extra money wasn’t worth the upgrade.  Defective products happen.  I just hoped that their flagship headphones would have worked better.  Regardless, spending hundreds of dollars to replace something missing is an instant return anyway.<br/><br/>I hope this helped someone.  Sorry for too much text.</span>

<span>Took a big risk with the price but oh boy, I was not disappointed! I have some sensory issues and have been travelling a lot recently. They allowed me to fall asleep during a flight which I've never been able to do! I really like that I can change the amount of noise cancelling depending on how I'm feeling. The sound quality is also outstanding! You can change the sound settings to your liking with the Bose app too. Also, insanely comfy!!!! I can wear these for hours at a time without getting uncomfy, and that's a big plus for me, especially cause most over the ear headphones push my glasses against my head and get uncomfortable after a long period. So far, haven't had that problem. Would definitely recommend!</span>

<span>Very happy with these ATH-M20X headphones. I bought them to get a sample of what the ATH-M50X might generally sound like.  I prefer these to my Sennheiser HD 599 SE which cost 3x more. The ATH-M20X have the mids and to a certain extent the highs which are missing from the HD 599's. If you want to hear ALL the music these are for you. I love hearing accentuations I've never heard in recordings I've listened to many times before. If you like bass heavy don't buy these. They aren't lacking in bass, the just aren't bass heavy.</span>

<span>So I got these yesterday, and I know I am not going to keep them for long (more on that later) so I want to get this review in ASAP. First off, while I know what I like &amp; I can recognize quality, I am definitely NOT an audiophile, so I'm not going to try &amp; tell you in TECHNICAL terms why these headphones are so great, but I can give a layman's perspective. Also, I am going to do a lot of comparing to the Samson SR850's I just bought AND my standby Koss PortaPros (which I compared the Samson's to in my review of them) Anyway, lets get started.<br/><br/>First of all the looks of these. My 13 year old daughter unboxed them while I was at work &amp; immediately exclaimed "These are NICE !" With that, she put them on, plugged in her iPod Touch &amp; didn't take them off until I got home several hours later. This from a kid who's favorite headphones are a purple pair of Knockoff Beats I bought at a flea market. They are MUCH better looking than the Samsons. The earcups are smaller &amp; lower profile, and the headband is covered in a stylish black leatherette. There is a LARGE AudioTechnica logo across the top of them, but who's going to be looking at the top of your head ?<br/><br/>As far as comfort goes, they are very comfortable, They are much lighter than the Samson's, and as I said smaller. The ear pads are suitably soft &amp; covered in the same leather like material as the headband. And while I doubt you could lie on your side comfortably with them on, they would be MORE comfortable than the Samson's in that position.<br/><br/>As for build quality, they are REALLY light, which worries me a bit, but they seem very solid. The main structure is definitely metal and the wires are thick &amp; well covered. The plugs also look a step up from your average headphone connector. While I am sure my kids would manage to break them eventually, I think they would last longer than your average headphone. And with me, they will be just fine.<br/><br/>Finally, lets talk sound. They sound AWESOME ! Really awesome. Much better than headphones at this price should sound. When I listened to the Samson's the first time I knew they sounded better than my Koss' ... but not by a lot. These are OBVIOUSLY better. The bass response is better, and everything else is CRYSTAL CLEAR ! Just stunning. That being said, they are not as loud as the Samson's which kinda surprised me since they are smaller &amp; closed back. But because of the better bass &amp; improvements across the full range of sound, I would definitely put these ahead of the Samson's AND the Koss' &amp; I am sure ANYONE who heard them all side by side by side would agree.<br/><br/>Now there are a few negatives. Like I said they are smaller &amp; Lighter than the Samson's. And I was looking for something LARGER ... so in that respect, they are going away from what I was looking for. And I still am surprised the Samsons are slightly louder. With the bigger size they should need more power to drive them properly. But since the M20's have less sound leak than the SR850's, this is really a non-issue.<br/><br/>And while they are very comfortable, after wearing them for a short time its clear that my ears are sweating in the M20's where they were not in the SR850's. Again, it may be because the latter are semi-open, but I think its because of the cloth covering on the SR850's pads AND because they are bigger.<br/><br/>Overall, even with the negatives, I would recommend these over the Samson SR850's w/o question. But, if that extra $15.00 means a lot to you, the Samson's are still an EXCELLENT Choice. And they will probably be my choice, since once my son HEARS these. he will be wanting to trade me the Samson's for them.<br/><br/>UPDATE: I have had these for just about 36 hours &amp; I just had a perfect stranger come up to me &amp; ask me if I liked them.l He obviously knew a lot more about headphones than I do &amp; has much better equipment (a $170 pair of BeyerDynamics) but he was impressed with these especially at the price.<br/><br/>UPDATE to the UPDATE: I recently bought a Fiio E6 Headphone Amp &amp; when my son comes home from College, I will try these out with the Amp. Considering how much they improved my Samson SR850's (I would put that combination AHEAD of these now) I am sure they will sound even more awesome. However,  I will NOT be buying that Amp for my son. If he wants one, he can buy it himself.<br/><br/>IN RESPONSE TO .... the two questions .... First off the Amp improves the M20's as much as it improves the Samson SR850's. The sound is cleaner, and I prefer using the degraded setting on the amp with increased volume on my source on these as well.<br/><br/>Second, as I said without the amp, these sound nearly as good as the Samson's WITH the amp. So I feel I have done enough for my son in that respect. If he wants to UP the quality with the amp, that's his choice. Just because I am not paying for it, doesn't represent my feeling for him one way or another. Of maybe it does. Either way I feel secure in my role as a parent &amp; the opinion of one crank won't affect that.</span>

<span>I needed a new set of over the ear closed back studio headphones, but didn't wanna spend lots of money, as it's not really necessary. These do the job well enough for me. When I plugged them into my phone, I was initially disappointed, but when I used them in the studio, as they're meant to be used for, is where they really shined. I compared them to my other headphones that are 4x expensive and the AT pair actually sounded better. I like them because there is no added bass, which you don't want added bass using them as studio headphone monitors, cause you want the true sound of whatever you're tracking so you can adjust sounds accordingly. If you're looking for a pair of listening headphones, like for your phone, etc, this would not be the pair I'd suggest. But, if you're looking for some inexpensive headphones for tracking then these are a good option. I would like for them to be a little louder, that's why I overall rated them 4/5 stars.</span>

<span>First off, this is not a comparison between the Anker Soundcore Q20s and any product from Bose or Sony.. That is an unfair comparison as they are not even in the same ball park.. I know that most people want to get an understanding of how comparable they are to those but if you aren't willing to spend the money on those, you aren't going to get near what they offer..<br/><br/>That being said, for this price range these are the best hands down.. One hit KO.. I'll list all the features separately so they are easy to find and read about.<br/><br/>Active Noise Cancellation:<br/>Let me get some things out of the way, I work at a gas plant in a landfill as IT and Data Reporting.. My job is noisy sometimes.. I hear a constant hum from the motors in the plant right outside my door all day long.. I also travel a lot from the various plants we run.. While ANC is on these headphones won't block out immediate talking next to me or sudden loud noises, but they do block out the noise from the plant.. That is without the music.. I do need to point out that the talking is trying to talk over motors so it's louder than your average office space. When the music is on and running, it adds a whole separate layer to the cancellation as I can no longer hear anything else..<br/><br/>Sound:<br/>I don't typically have music up loud, most I've turned them up to is 50% because I've been rough on my ear drums since I was a kid playing drums at a young age.. As I've gotten older I've been more prone to try and protect my ears.. That being said, the sound quality is very nice with or without ANC engaged.. I find it's way more enjoyable with ANC on due to everything else being tuned out.. Some headphones will warp the sound when ANC is turned on, these do not.. The sound is as impressive with the feature on as it is off.. This is incredible.. I listen to a range of music from Rap and Hip-Hop to Metal and Hard Rock and they all sound clear and precise in these headphones..<br/><br/>They do have a bass-up feature that increases the bass a little more.. This works well without muddying the sound quality too much.. I imagine if you increase the volume too much it might diminish but from my listening around the 50% max it's been outstanding.. Bass gains can be a real hit and miss for me as some lose sound quality.. With these that's not the case..<br/><br/>Quality:<br/>The headphones feel amazing.. They have a nice weight to them (which is not for everyone). I personally like a little weight to my equipment.. It is sturdy and feels solid.. I was afraid of it feeling a little too plastic like but they really don't.. Now they aren't as nice as your $200-$300 headphone, but again, their price range they are amazing quality.. The ear cups are very comfortable and soft memory foam.. I was actually surprised that my ears don't get as hot as normal.. They will overtime due to the design.. It's impossible to get around since it traps heat, but these seem like they don't get as warm as fast.. Also the ear cups feel amazing.. I've literally worn them all day yesterday and felt no ear fatigue or strain.. This is a solid!<br/><br/>Functionality:<br/>A feature that isn't talked about a lot with these is the awesome ability to connect to not just one but two devices simultaneously.. Now a note on that: You cannot listen to two devices at the same time.. What is going on is I'm able to connect to my computer and listen to music on it while being connect to my phone at the same time.. When someone calls me and I answer, it swaps input to my iPhone and stops playing the music in my ears.. Once the call is finished, it swaps back to my computer and I resume listening.. This is an amazing feature that I use daily!<br/><br/>Battery:<br/>The battery is very nice.. When I received my unit the first thing I did was pair it to my devices (of course) and started checking it out.. I received them with 60% battery.. I used them the rest of that day at work for a couple of hours.. then when I left, used them a little more at the house and watched half of a movie on them before going to bed.. They were still at 60%.. The box says that they last 40 hours and that is accurate.. If you don't use the Bass-Up technology you can squeeze even more.. and to not use the ANC it goes up higher.. 40 hours for battery life though is incredible for this price range.. I cannot complain!<br/><br/>Packaging:<br/>The packaging was very nice and well put together.. It came with a charge cable and 3.5mm aux cable (which is great for my Nintendo Switch when I fly).. While I would have loved to seen a USB-C type adapter (as would many others) that is still an expensive change to make and would probably bump the price up out of the $60 range.. I understand from a manufacturing point the reasoning to possibly go with a micro-USB.. It would be nice for C, but it is what it is.. That doesn't change how well this thing is made and works.. The only gripe I have and it's a minor thing is the case they come with.. Well, you can't call it a case cause it's just a bag.. Now, it's a very nice bag, but I throws these buys in a backpack with a laptop and iPad and Switch (in a hardcase) and so a bag doesn't really protect your headphones.. Luckily I had a nice hard case from a cheap pair of headphone I received a few years ago (the case was the nicest part) and they fit perfectly.. So if you don't have one buy a hard case for them..<br/><br/>Overall:<br/>Overall, for the price these are the best hands down.. You really cannot beat their ANC and sound quality for this price.. I will definitely buy these again and probably buy my wife some so she'll stop stealing mine.. If it was out of 10, I'd give this product a 9/10 simply due to no hard shell case..</span>

<span>Let me start off by explaining my use-case for these headphones.<br/><br/>I was in the market looking for something to be a good accompaniment to my brand new Oculus Quest 2. I planned on sharing the play experience with some friends, so earbuds were out of the question for sanitary reasons. I wasn't looking for stupidly-expensive headphones to have to play some VR games, but wanted something decent so Beat Saber would sound better haha. Previously, I had bought these $15 Panasonic headphones that had banger reviews, but once they arrived, I put them on, turned on some music, and instantly boxed it back up. Trash. So back to Amazon I went to look for something that's more bang-for-your-buck. I stumbled upon a bunch of non-mainstream headphones and then eventually to these. I have some Anker chargers and stuff but I never knew Anker made audio hardware, so I thought I'd read some reviews and try them out since they were on sale for $45 vs. their $60 MSRP. I knew now that if I wanted even the slightest decency in quality, I'd have to spend more than $15 haha.<br/><br/>Next, let me explain my experience in audio hardware.<br/><br/>I wouldn't consider myself a professional audiophile, but I know good sound when I hear it. My most expensive pair of headphones are my Sennheiser HD 650 for when I dabble in music production or want listen to music at the highest quality pair with my FiiO portable amp interface, my pair of Sony MDR-V6 (my favorite pair of headphones/ studio monitors and ol' faithful), Sennheiser CX 5.00i (hands-down best-sounding and most-balanced earbuds), 2 pairs of Sennheiser CX 300 (best-sounding alternative to the 5.00i), Beats Studio (trash), Beats Solo HD (even more trash), airpods 1st gen, and various pairs of earpods lying around. Hopefully that gives you a small glimpse of how much high-quality audio means to me...or how stupid I am for owning a couple pairs of Beats...<br/><br/>NOW FOR THE BREAKDOWN ------<br/><br/>Sound Quality ---- 8/10<br/>These are actually quite above decent! The price is just a bonus. I'd say the quality as normal headphones for listening to music and gaming, they're perfect. Crisp highs and good lows (with a bit of a default bass-enhancement). The mids could use a bit of work but to be honest, for $45 this is prob some of the best sound you can get at this price-point. Pretty much what a lot of these reviews say. Heck, these may be better than/ as good as  most name-brand $100-200. I've used various Bose Quiet Comfort series headphones ($300+) and haven't been impressed with their sound quality. I would say these sound just as good, if not better, than Bose QC headphones, as controversial as that may be to say haha. Another comparison is against my airpods, which I consider pretty good-sounding. I would say these are about the same as airpods, but with added bass and optional added bass on top of that. Beats muddle everything else with their added bass, while these don't IMO. Overall, sound quality on these is solid and for under $60, I would say is a steal.<br/><br/>DO NOT USE FOR MUSIC PRODUCTION OR AS STUDIO MONITORS<br/>I only say this because there are reasons that these are just meant for listening. There are drivers in these that may not sit well with production hardware, such as an amplified audio interface, preamps, or other equipment. When I plugged this into my FiiO via the provided aux cable, the sound became unbalanced. It's probably because it wasn't meant to take in more power than it was built with, so better to leave these headphones vanilla than add anything else to them. Use them for listening or gaming and you should experience optimal sound quality. Oh and also, DON'T EVER BUY BEATS. These headphones sound eons better than any of the Beats products that I've owned/ tried, including the discontinued $400 Beats Pro.<br/><br/>Comfort ---- 10/10<br/>These are also quite comfortable. I've worn it as long as 3-hour time period so far and the sides of my head/ ears weren't sore like after long wears of my Sennheiser HD 650s. Just like my Sony MDR-V6s they are foldable, so that may have something to do with the flexibility of its entirety. My Sennheiser HD 650s are non-foldable, and that's a big drawback for those :'(. The memory foam pads covered with faux leather allows the headphones to comfortably conform to your head shape. The only thing I can really compare the comfort to is the Beats Studio, which surprisingly, despite their build quality, are pretty comfortable. Overall, I feel like these would fit most heads and provide almost universal comfort.<br/><br/>Features ---- meh, not much to talk about<br/>Really the only added features are the optional bass-boost and active noise canceling (ANC). The optional bass-boost isn't bad, it just doesn't do much for me because bass is already enhanced right outta the box. So if you're into bass-boosted and bass-heavy music, these will be quite pleasant for sure! The ANC also doesn't really do much for me since I listen to my music loud enough to drown out pretty much everything anyway. But, when I turn it on without music playing, it does do something. It's not quite as effective as the Bose QC headphones, but I think it works pretty well in most loud situations. I just haven't used it on a plane yet haha. The volume control buttons have an annoying beep every time you press + or - , but whatever. This actually sucks- you can't use the headphones while they're charging, even wired. Ridiculous, I know. But hey, can't have everything, right? Big oof on Anker's end on that.<br/><br/>Aesthetics ---- 6/10<br/>Not gonna lie, these are pretty generic looking headphones. They don't have some revolutionary design to it, but they look like your average good-looking generic headphones. They aren't flashy like Beats or Airpods (or probably the upcoming Airpods Studio) but they don't look bad at all. They're just...normal. But, I did only get the black pair, so maybe the gray one looks better in different settings. Don't let this be a deal-breaker, though.<br/><br/>Connectivity ---- 6/10<br/>Wired, these things are perfect. The provided cable could be longer, but that's nothing against the headphones themselves. Just buy an extender or a longer cable online for like $10 or less. THE ONLY REASON I'M KNOCKING OFF A STAR is because of what a lot of people are complaining about: the choppiness and clicking of the Bluetooth connectivity. Every now and then the headphones will click or have that split-second static noise while I'm listening via bluetooth. It's not often, but happens enough to dock a start off. Now, I could just return these and try to get another pair, but I'm too lazy and don't really care too much about the clipping every now and then, so that's on me. But, it's a problem a lot of other reviewers are complaining about so it's a legitimate issue. The range is fine so far. I've been able to walk 30 ft. away without any clipping issues. I've also used these for video calls and they work just fine with no clipping.<br/><br/>Conclusion ---- Overall grade: 9/10<br/>You may or may not find headphones this great-sounding at this price-point or even a step up in price-point, but then again I haven't tried every single pair of headphones on the market. But I can say with confidence that these stack up pretty well against my studio headphones that I own and I would recommend these to anyone looking for decent-sounding headphones, because with these, you'll get way more than what you're looking for. These will definitely be a pleasure to play VR games with and even moreso just listening to music while at home or traveling!<br/><br/>Now if you're looking for decent earbuds, I recommend the Sennheiser CX 5.00i! (If you haven't noticed, i'm definitely biased towards Sennheiser, but they're industry-standard and the have the best sounding audio products I've ever experience, hands-down)</span>

<span>UPDATE, 2/29/20: Anker Customer Service has provided me an updated pair of the headphones for reevaluation. I have not experienced the popping issue at all with the new pair, so I am updating my rating to 4 stars. I still really enjoy the sound from these while ANC is on; strong, fun bass, and not at the expense of the mids and treble. Also, customer service also sent me replacement earpads in the event that they fail over time.<br/><br/>Once again, I cannot say enough about how amazing Anker's customer service is. Many companies out there could learn a lot from how much they want their customers to be satisfied!<br/><br/>UPDATE, 1/31/20: Unfortunately these are being returned, for 2 reasons:<br/><br/>1) I'm getting the popping noise whenever I take off the headphones while playing in ANC mode (which is always). This simply cannot happen for headphones at any price point, much less $60.<br/><br/>2) I can see already that the earpad leatherette covering is beginning to pull away from the housing. Since receiving the headphones, I have treated them with kid gloves, so in less than 2 weeks time I'm already beginning to see potential for long term build quality issues.<br/><br/>So, as with other reviewers, bummed that these just don't live up to Anker quality. Leaving them at 2 stars as they are serviceable, but not a long term gamble I'm willing to take.<br/><br/>ORIGINAL REVIEW, 1/25/20:<br/><br/>We live in a world of excess. Headphones are a prime example of this. Not only are there many "name brand" manufacturers of headphones out there (Sony, Bose, Beats. et. al.), there are now endless "no-name" brands peddling junk. There are a handful of companies trying to find some middle ground, TaoTronics, Mpow, and, of course, Anker Soundcore. When it comes to headphones, at least for me, is value for price paid. Without a doubt, the more expensive headphones by Sony &amp; Bose offer the best quality across the board, but they're not such a great value, at least for my needs. And to go super cheap with no name brands is a waste of time, as you'll make major sacrifices. Anker is trying to establish itself as the sweet spot for solid value without making too many sacrifices.<br/><br/>Like other reviewers, I have used other Anker products, some good, some not so good. Their charging products are nothing short of spectacular. Their audio products, on the other hand, have always been hit or miss. I decided to take a chance on the Q20 headphones because A) they are a few generations in, so hopefully Anker has made improvements over time, and; B) they sit at a great price point (between $40-60 depending on timing). Not cheap, but not astronomical either.<br/><br/>So after using them for a week, and making the decision not to return them (I have returned countless headphones), I wanted to share my first impressions. Maybe these will change over time as the build quality ages, or sound quality evolves with burn-in, but I wanted to try and help those on the fence with some honesty rather than the endless one line five star reviews.<br/><br/>PROS<br/><br/>Comfort. While these are in no way portable, they are fairly light and not overly bulky. Most of the cheaper over-ears are simply too much like earmuffs in an attempt to maximize comfort and/or improve sound quality.<br/><br/>Sound Quality. This one is both a pro and a con, so I will come back to this below. For the most part, I enjoy the sound quality on these. Admittedly, I like extra oomph in the bass, and these are definitely bass headphones.<br/><br/>Battery Life. Gave them a full charge when I received them, and probably won't need to charge them again for likely...weeks. Since I only use them at work and occasionally around the house, I expect the battery to last quite a while.<br/><br/>Value. So far, I feel like I am getting every cent out of my investment in these. Sure, they are not perfect (as you will see below), but for the price paid, they are meeting my expectations.<br/><br/>CONS<br/><br/>Noise Canceling. Yeah, Anker threw in noise canceling as that feature is hot right now. It's there, but it's mediocre. Would I trust it if I was a frequent traveler? No. That would be worth an investment in Bose or Sony. But at work and around the house, it's fine. I haven't encountered the popping issues other reviewers have experienced, so I will have to wait and see on that.<br/><br/>Build Quality. This is where Anker was able to keep the price point low. These aren't the most solidly built, but they are passable so long as they are handled decently. A case would have mitigated this, but again, cost. The buttons are not the best, and over time I can tell that these will likely be the first things to fail.<br/><br/>Sound Quality. Here is where I will contradict myself. There is a discernible difference in the bass level between noise canceling being off vs. on. When off, the cans really thump with bass, which is great when listening to pop, hip hop, or EDM. It's too overpowering for most rock songs, as it drowns out pretty much everything else. It's still listenable, but gets exhausting after awhile. With noise canceling on, it's better, but it seems like the sound quality degrades somewhat with the added layer of processing. Not a steep decline, but it does mean that I leave the noise cancellation on all the time, which will result in the battery dying quicker. Not a deal breaker.<br/><br/>TL;DR: So overall, I recommend these headphones if you are looking for a solid pair of cans at a reasonable price, KNOWING WHAT YOU ARE BUYING. These are not going to give you superior performance on any feature, except for battery life. They are definitely acceptable for what you're paying for, and so long as the build quality holds up, should meet your needs for a couple of years. And if not, Anker has an 18-month warranty on defects, and their customer service is A+.</span>

<span>I'll be quite honest that I first bought these when trying to find one of the cheapest reputable noise cancelling headphones that I planned to use exclusively for mowing.  I have a 3 acre lawn and spend hours mowing each week and the regular headphones just had to be jacked up too loud to hear over the drone so I finally jumped on these.<br/><br/>These headphones have been nothing short of great for me.  I'm sure you'll find plenty of people griping about options that may be missing and no app support and yada yada yada but the truth is, these offer a large amount of bang for the buck.  Noise cancelling and great, but not perfect when comparing to Bose headphones (shocker, right?)  Ears do start to sweat a little after an hour or so but that's not extremely surprising either.  Plenty loud, especially if you turn off the noise cancelling.  Perhaps this is par for the course, but I was slightly disappointed at how much bass you lose when you turn on the noise cancelling.  They actually shocked me at how much bass they have when comparing to other headphones 4 times their price.  I wouldn't go as far as to call them boomy but they do have a good punch.<br/><br/>At the end of the day, i've liked these headphones so much that i've had to keep moving them between the garage and the house as I use them to watch movies late at night when I don't wanna wake the rest of the family up.<br/><br/>They are a great budget friendly pair of noise cancelling headphones with a great battery life.  I'd buy again!</span>

<span>A little background on my experiences with studio headphones in general: I've really struggled to find a good pair over the years that accomplished exactly what I was looking for and gave me a good way to monitor mixes when I don't have access to full studio monitors (which is, most of the time.) I've tried both closed-backed and open-backed variants of reference headphones and had mixed results with pretty much every one of them. These however, I haven't found a single issue with in terms of sound and results. They're extremely natural to my ears, and are very crisp and clear. To me, they don't have this huge, binaural-eseque soundstage to them compared to some other open-backed sets I've tried, but their openness does lend to everything sounding more clear and separate compared to the closed sets I've used, for sure. And I'd venture to say they are the most comfortable variant of open back sets I've worn as well. Ever since I purchased these I've noticed subtle mixing choice differences I have made in recent projects that have really elevated how consistent my tracks sound on various devices, in my experience - if I can get something to sound good on these, they'll sound great on everything else I try, and phenomenal on my listening sets of choice! I wouldn't say these offer anything spicy in terms of sound, or lean at all in the "fun" side of things. But for analytical use? These rock.</span>

<span>I'm no expert, but I am slowly building up my affordable studio, to be a content creator, and I also love making music with Reason, and these are my first high quality studio headphones with a good even spectrum of sound reproduction and I am absolutely in love with these. Amazing sound. It also picks up most or all sub bass. I know there are supposedly better things out there, but this is like 99% or 98% perfection for a reasonable price. Good enough for my needs. And, with the 32 ohm, you don't need to buy an amplifier.<br/><br/>They grip a little tight on my big head, so prolonged use can become a bit painful.<br/><br/>!!Warning!! My wife liked them so much I had to buy her a pair.<br/><br/>Tip: if you are using Windows and the sound is distorted, make sure you go into your Windows sound properties and turn off the Equalizer, and also turn off Loudness Equalization (which will cause horrible distortion at times)</span>

<span>I think one of the strongest selling points for these phones are their comfort. You don't think you need it until you try it once and understand the difference - because it turns out being distracted by any discomfort will disrupt your listening experience in ways you really wish it didn't. These headphones feel incapable of discomfort even if you wore them all day long.<br/><br/>As for the sound quality, these phones (like any other headphones) are going to show 'colorization' at certain frequencies and this model has colorization behavior that concerned me and most likely others too.<br/><br/>These headphones are a just a bit too bright at louder volumes (particularly for music). It's very clear they are this way if you check out their frequency response graph (see photo) - especially at higher volumes. Another graph clearly shows it gets even more pronounced the louder it gets (see photo). If you don't suspect you will listen to these at louder volumes most of the time, then this isn't really an issue, and can actually be an advantage because brightness at lower volumes generally improves clarity.<br/><br/>That said, my impression is that these headphones were not quite intended to be used at higher volumes. From a numbers perspective, the graphs show this, and additionally, this particular model is rated up to 100 mW of power whereas other comparable phones can handle up to 1,000 mW (there's not a lot of room for loud volumes / higher power use). In fact, if you run these at louder volumes, you can tell they start to clip a bit sooner than you might expect.<br/><br/>Granted, a lot of people are not going to use these at higher volumes - but I also know there are people out there that really want to listen to music loudly (not ear bleeding!) and these headphones show concerns at the kind of loudness I am trying to describe.<br/><br/>If you think you will listen to these loudly - what you can do about it is use software (or hardware) to alter the EQ of whatever you are running these on. I use them on my laptop (behind a DAC/Amp) and for those of you who are using them on a computer, you may be very interested in a free software called Equalizer APO along with the Peace plugin. It will give you a 13 band EQ where you can set the changes wherever and however you want. The most useful feature of this software is you can overlay the picture of the frequency response graph on top of the graph of the changes you are making. When done this way, you can achieve a highly accurate and complete correction of the colorization (see photo). Do note that if you do this, to not apply as much correction as you get closer to the high end because of the way the headphones behave with volume changes - you will want to only correct about 2/3 to 1/2 as much to give some room for these changes.<br/><br/>If you bother to do this - it will drastically improve the sound profile of these headphones. It will feel like you added 100's of dollars of value to them because frankly - it's quite difficult to manufacture headphones to sound uncolored by themselves - the physics behind it will always introduce some colorized sound. There is some color you may want and others you don't - but if you don't bother to use something to correct for the colorization - you might find yourself wondering if some other pair of headphones will more closely produce your 'ideal' sound and begin a cycle of trying to find that 'perfect' pair and keep discovering they all have some bit of colorization.<br/><br/>If you spend about $150 here you can get top of the line comfort and very capable headphones, and for free, help correct it's sound profile to your needs.<br/><br/>Now, you can't improve certain things like sound stage or imaging this way - but if you were concerned about that there's a good chance this model wasn't your first choice because these are closed headphones and not the top of the line model offered by this company.<br/><br/>Beyond the brightness colorization, the mid and bass response are great. The mids stay pretty neutral at all volumes. As some people have noted, they can be bassy.<br/><br/>Yes - they are very capable of reproducing the low end in ways most headphones just can't. To be more specific, they have pretty good low end *range* - as in you can really hear the sub bass. But, there is a slight problem with their bass response at specifically around 210 Hz.<br/><br/>I highly suspect with non-electronic music you may not notice this because it's not the most represented frequency - but if you do listen to electronic music - there's a good chance you will feel the bass doesn't quite sound the way you remember. Well, it happens to be a prominent frequency for kicks and bass lines - so it's fairly present in the sound spectrum for electronic music. I would boost this area specifically to see the difference and leave it at that.<br/><br/>There will be some people who think that, overall, the bass is too present, and indeed it's true that there is significant bass response if you look at the frequency response graph. Just like with the brightness, it gets more pronounced the louder you go.  For those of you who listen to electronic music, there's a good chance you will really appreciate this - it can be amazing how these headphones respond. However, if you don't listen to electronic music - this is probably unwanted in a lot of cases. Again, I would apply EQ correction for this - but in this case I would just apply an overall bass reduction as the bass response is pretty even unlike the high end which has several peaks and valleys in that range and is more complex to correct.<br/><br/>That about wraps out my thoughts on the sound quality.<br/><br/>I will say that if you don't have an amp for the 80+ ohm models, you will most likely find these too quiet - they will sound about half as loud as you expect they can achieve. This is expected because of the higher resistance. Most likely, you will want an amp to drive these. That said, I don't recommend the 80+ ohm models for mobile users... those are more for stationary users.<br/><br/>If you don't already have an amp, and plan on getting one, do yourself a favor, and make sure that either your amp has a built-in DAC, or plan to get a separate DAC. The main reason for that is the DAC will ensure the amp is getting the kind of electrical signal it's expecting. In my case when I only had the amp and no DAC, the amp was prematurely clipping at lower volumes because of the output from the laptop - this was immediately fixed by the DAC I bought.<br/><br/>As for the build quality - pretty sure these will last a lifetime with care. There's nothing particular cheaply made that I noticed about these phones. I'm not concerned with the way they look. They aren't displeasing to me - but I'm also not thinking these are the coolest looking phones, but I don't care about that.</span>

<span>Before getting these Beyerdynamics, I'd never spent more than $50 on a pair of headphones. Over the last thirty years, I've had headphones in that price category by Sennheiser, Koss, Audio-Technica, and Philips. For the last ten years, I've been unnecessarily content with a pair of Philips SBC HP250 32 ohm headphones. I've missed decades of opportunities to listen to quality sound because of this misplaced frugality. These DT770 Pro headphones resolve and clarify detail that in my previous headphones was a sonic blur.<br/><br/>Specifications: Beyerdynamic headphones are made in Germany. The DT770 Pro is available in 80 ohm and 250 ohm. These are the 250 ohm model. Frequency response on either model is 5 Hz to 35 kHz. They are closed back headphones, and the ambient noise attenuation is approximately 18 dbA. THD (total harmonic distortion) is less than 0.2% and nominal SPL (sound pressure level) is 96 dB. Their power handling capacity is 100 mW. The cable is 3 meters long, which is coiled on the 250 ohm model and straight on the 80 ohm model.<br/><br/>The coiled cable isn't long enough to wear the headphones and move far from the jack, so I've linked it to a </span>

<span> I bought after getting the phones. This allows me to sit or move around the room some distance from the jack, but I think now that a 15 foot extension would have been a better choice, since I don't like to overstretch the coils on the headphone cable. (This Mogami cable is heavy duty and I absolutely recommend it.)<br/><br/>These 250 ohm phones work fine without a headphone amp, plugged straight into my i3 Toshiba Satellite P745 laptop (year 2012 model). I do amplify them, though (because I already had the amp and they sound even better amped), with a (discontinued) Rane HC 4S headphone console.<br/><br/>Specs on the Rane amp: This is a four phone amp (actually four amps in one rolled steel, rack-mountable box) designed to take the output of a studio mixer (so it's not an audiophile amp). It takes two ¼ inch phone plugs (tip/ring) for input and then outputs to both a stereo 3.5mm mini jack or stereo ¼ inch stereo phone jack for each headphone (choose one per amp), and is switchable overall from stereo to mono. Each phone has its own volume control and LED overload indicator. The amp has output impedance of 1 ohm max and will drive phones from 32 to 600 ohms, taking them typically up to 120 dB SPL, with 200 mW minimum power for 32 to 150 ohm phones (with 75 ohm phones being optimum at 239 mW, and yielding 146 mW for 300 ohm phones). Frequency response is 10 Hz to 45 kHz (+0/-3 dB).<br/><br/>From the computer to the amp: I do not have a DAC between the computer and amp. To connect the laptop to the amp, I use a six foot long </span>

<span> with 3.5mm stereo plug to dual ¼ inch phone plugs, and plug it into the headphone jack of the laptop. This cable was designed for the iPod and is of higher quality (and more costly) than the three foot long Hosa cable I was using before this. (Sescom also makes cables with a 3.5 mm stereo plug going to two RCA plugs.) I use a right-angle 3.5mm female to 3.5mm male adapter at the headphone jack to protect the cable and jack from developing a short from the weight of the cable. As of this writing, I'm using an adapter from Radio Shack, but I might try a Hosa brand of the same type.<br/><br/>The first thing I did on getting the Beyerdynamics was to compare them, using the Rane amp, with the Philips SBC HP250 I've been using for years. The DT 770 at 250 ohms is softer in loudness than the 32 ohm Philips at the same volume setting, but not by much. The difference in clarity and sound quality, especially at high volume, is striking. I'll leave it to others to write about soundstage and presentation of low, mid, and high frequency ranges. I also use these phones with my ten-year-old Sony receiver, straight from the headphone jack, and they are an improvement over my previous headphones.<br/><br/>Software: On the laptop, I'm using JRiver Media Center (purchased) and VLC Media Player (free). I started out with foobar2000 (free) for audio, but JRiver is superior and worth the small expense. Media Monkey is another program I tested. It is also free unless you want the more advanced version. I highly recommend JRiver Media Center. I've set it as the default player for videos also, usurping VLC. However, VLC and foobar2000 (along with Irfan View for a picture viewer and simple image editor) are good programs that can replace the Windows media player with advanced features and without cost. They remain on my computer with shortcuts on my desktop. I use iTunes for iTunes U and nothing else.<br/><br/>These headphones sound good with this setup, although I suspect there is more quality to be had from them with better mediation between the audio's digital data and the headphones (i.e. audiophile grade DAC and amp, such as those available from Musical Fidelity, Burson, or Lehmann Audio, among many others.<br/><br/>I had to return the first pair of these headphones for a replacement before a month was past because the right side cut out. I got them from the Recording Store here at amazon and out in the physical world in New York. They sent me a phone number to call. I asked for a new pair (I really like these headphones), and they happily sent me a return label via email. I had the replacements via USPS Priority within a week (literally) of sending out the defective pair via UPS. Excellent service.<br/><br/>Choices (for me) flanking the DT 770 Pro 250 Ohm were the </span>

I have no regrets about my choice.<br/><br/>You can spend a lot of money on headphones. You can also spend hardly any money at all. You'll hear the tune and pulse of the music in even the cheapest phones. It's up to you to decide how much you're willing to pay to hear more. I think the DT Pro 250 Ohm is a good pair of entry-level audiophile headphones.</span>

<span>Edit: The plastic L/R parts WILL crack on the inside and eventually break.  With heavy use(most or a good chunk of every day), you can expect them to crack within around a year, though they may still work perfectly fine.  Over time the cracks get worse to where they need to be replaced, and while beyerdynamic will replace them free of charge(at least under warranty), they're around $45 shipped on their own.  This all said I suggest getting 3D printed replacements, they can be found on thingiverse.  You should be able to find them by looking for beyerdynamic slider repair kit.  There is also another version under "Remix" on that page which looks similar to the originals.  As well I found one with a more appealing L and R if you click "Thing Details" and click the TinkerCAD link, then find the one under "Original &amp; Copies" on that page.  I would also suggest ABS plastic as it should be durable enough, and generally better than PLA for a part under any sort of stress.<br/><br/>TLDR?:Overview at the bottom.<br/>Amazing.  I upgraded from the AudioTechnica ATH-M50's, and I'm glad I did.  In terms of overall clarity I can't say that they blow the M50's out of the water or anything, but I love the sound of these cans.  While a frequency response graph may not agree completely, I'd say they have that fUn curve, flat enough to not be too overwhelming, but definitely more bass and treble than mids.  And my god the bass, if you think the M50's are bass monsters I'd say you're crazy(even before hearing these), it might be the really good isolation on these helping out, but they boom.  Again it's not overwhelming, but very punchy out of the box, and either I've grown used to it or it has slowly died down some over time(which can happen as the clamping force calms down, and possibly burn in if you believe in that).  If you don't understand what I mean, think of a gun shot in a movie or videogame, it's brief but loud and hard hitting....so it's like that, the bass is "punchy"(or tight) as in it hits you then stops, and it's like you can feel the impact.  It can make playing a first person shooter like Battlefield 4 very engaging.  The highs on the other hand are quite harsh and sharp in my opinion, in a way that any bad quality audio can become quite obnoxious, or a song that was recorded in a way in which some highs are already kind of harsh to listen to(guitar solo in Daft Punk's Aerodynamic, love the song, but those highs still feel harsh).  So basically sibilance or other bad artifacts in a recording can become quite noticeable.  These are meant for professionals and often used in studios so it should be expected that they be rather accurate and unforgiving.<br/><br/>The clamping force out of the box is easily bearable, they might be tight to someone used to a very light headphone, and possibly fatiguing to some.  To compare to the M50's again, when I got mine(M50's) I thought I was going to return them the second I had put them on my head.  M50's NEED to be stretched out some, otherwise I could almost guarantee you'll experience fatigue wearing them.  That said the M50's do stretch out fairly fast.  Anyways as I said the clamping force is strong but nothing that should stop people from being able to wear them for a few hours thanks to the comfy pads.  The pads are nice and soft, but strong enough to hold up and not give in under pressure, and the cans are big enough that they should fit the vast majority of ears, unlike some "circumaural" headphones that end up with the pads resting on all but a child's ears.  In my opinion the sizing of the headband could be better, the spacing between notches leaves me with one side 1 notch longer than the other.  Not a huge issue but somewhat bothersome.  The 250ohm version will very likely benefit from a dedicated amplifier, if you don't have much money but are using this on a PC, the Objective2 amplifier(sold by many different audio companies) are nice amplifiers for the money, and about the cheapest that can handle many high end headphones pretty well.  Note that some desktops might handle them well enough these days, but I'd suggest using the rear output as it's usually better, but depends on the built in audio solution on the motherboard.  My only other con is that they use a coiled cable, now I don't hate coiled cables, but I do find they're often way too tight and not forgiving enough to be useful.  I guess I could also say that the headband is pleather and feels rather cheap, but as it's replaceable along with many other parts of these headphones, for that I can forgive it...especially as most headphones headband's padding are built in and can't be replaced.<br/><br/>Edit: The included travel pouch feels cheap, but is plenty big enough to fit everything easily. I tried them out on a friend's laptop, it was some fairly cheap laptop from his work, and it easily powered these past comfortable levels.  That said I didn't do any serious listening, but I was quite sure the quality of the audio solution built into it wasn't that great.(End of Edit)<br/><br/>Note: The ATH-M50's are over 2 years old, maybe even closer to 3, so the clamping force on them is fairly weak, and being someone with glasses means they likely don't get a perfect seal.  Therefore take some comparisons with a slight grain of salt, I'd still prefer the 770's over the M50's but they aren't bad cans by any means.<br/><br/>Overview:<br/>Pros:<br/>-Tight boomy bass without being overwhelming<br/>-Clear enough for many professionals(often used for studio monitoring)<br/>-Fun U(or V) sound signature<br/>-Comfy velour pads<br/>-Quality materials<br/>-Most parts are replaceable(fairly easily for the padding)<br/>-Great passive noise isolation, but can still hear if needed<br/>-Big enough to fit most heads/ears<br/>-Carry bag can hold the headphones and cable easily, it's huge...though cheap feeling<br/><br/>Cons:<br/>-Sharp/harsh highs<br/>-Sizing the headband could have better fine adjustment<br/>-Pads need replacement every 1-2 years depending on usage(even with cleaning they will flatten out and change the sound)<br/>-Coiled cable is rather tight and unforgiving<br/>-Clamping force *might* be too much for the more sensitive(nowhere near as bad as ATH-M50's)<br/>-250ohm version may not reach full potential with portable use/weak built in amplifiers on products(to be expected from high impedance versions and there is the 80ohm version...and now 32ohm)<br/>-Pleather headband feels cheap, but it is replaceable</span>

<span>The Sennheiser HD 280 Pro "New Model" Assembled in the USA is a game-changer for me. Over the years I have tried several Senn Closed-Back headphones only to wonder how they could make some of the best Open Back Headphones and some of the worst Closed headphones. I'll back up a bit. My first pair of headphones was a pair of Koss Pro 4AA's. I had just gotten out of the Army and it was 1971. I loved them. I still have a pair of Koss Porta Pros to this day. My current headphone collection includes the Sennheiser HD 580 Jubilee, HD 650, and the New Model 280 HD Pro. I also have a pair each of the  Fostex T50RP MK3; the Sony MDR V900HD and the Sony MDR 7506, The original Audio Technica ATH M30 and the ATH M40fs, as well as a vintage pair of JVC HA-D990's that are not for sale.  None of these headphones are.<br/><br/>While none of the above info proves anything where my headphone expertise is concerned, it does prove I have good taste where headphones are concerned. So here's the thing. With the New Model HD280Pro Sennheiser has shown the World that it can make a very competitive Closed-Back headphone at a price almost anyone can afford. In addition to the New Model Senn 280 I also recently bought a pair of Audio Technica ATH M40x headphones. In my opinion, they are not even close to being as well built as my Old pair of Audio Technica ATH M30s. In direct comparison the Old M30s make the relatively New ATH M40X cans seem like a toy to me. Nor did they have near the sonic relationship with either my Solid State Emotiva A-100 BASX Amp or my Little Dot MK II tube amp. At about the same price the New M40x was not an improvement over my Old M40fs cans. In my opinion the M40x is a joke compared to my M40fs cans. About the same price, but not even close in every other respect. The M40x is a throwaway can, the M40fs is a keeper. The New Model Sennheiser HD280 Pro is a keeper as well. Very Neutral can. Lows, Mids, and Highs are ready to reveal what has been recorded.  If you don't like their sound it is probably your Sound Souce that is at fault. Some Bands are really not very good. Some Recording Engineers are not very good either. Some Bands and some Recording Engineers are great. The New Model HD280Pro will reveal which it is. Become an Audiophile. If Zen is selling water by a river, then being an audiophile is learning to know the difference between dogs barking and a host of singing angels Don't get me wrong. Sometimes barking at the moon is just what the good Doctor ordered. But nothing compares to the singing of angels. I think I will shut up for now and try out my New Model Sennheiser HD280s on two of my favorite angels. George Jones, and Patsy Cline. It doesn't get any better than that. Amen..</span>

<span>Nice durable feel , good sound quality, not the most comfortable at first, perhaps over time will improve, but everything is tight feeling and the cord is hard wired , it is very tightly coiled , do yourself a favor and buy an extension to alleviate the associated issue with the cord being coiled so tightly it restricts movement somewhat ….. over all these are solid quality at the price point , the feel a littler cheap , but they live up<br/>To Senheiser expectations sound wise which is the most important feature!!!</span>

<span>I'm no audiophile, gotta get that out of the way.<br/><br/>Three stars?  This is because of the cable, maybe nit-picky, but touching/movement of the cable resonates a very annoying sound into the headphones.  Also, if you grew up with a telephone with a coiled cable you will receive flashbacks about how awful they are.<br/><br/>So audio quality, these are definitely the best headphones I've ever used.  Plugging them into my Mac Book Pro with with DAC and dolby atmos turned on is absolutely amazing.  Must repeat, I am no audiophile or claim to have a heightened sense of hearing, also, my first "professional" set of headphones.  I do own Bose QC35, HyperX, Airpod Pros, all with their own function, but these Sennheiser's definitely have better sound and bass compared to my other headphones.<br/><br/>I will probably gift these to a friend and buy another pair with a replaceable straight cable, but with the fault I mentioned I still think they are amazing but would not buy this specific model with the same cable again.</span>

<span>I’ve been using these everyday for work and working out for about 5 months now and they’ve held up fantastically and always work as expected. The noise canceling function works spectacularly and is great for whatever noise you may have to cancel out. I used it on a plane recently and it was so effective at cancelling out the loud engine sounds. Aware mode is awesome as well as I can use it at work or in public without feeling nervous that I might miss someone talking to me.</span>

<span>I've had the QC45s for about a month. I got them because my roommate has had a pair of QC35 IIs for many years, and I wanted a pair of my own and wanted to see if the reality was as bad as some of the reviews.<br/><br/>Overall, the negative reviews are a bit exaggerated - I think these are great headphones. Super comfortable, great noise cancellation, pretty solid battery life. The ability to edit the quality of the sound in the app (more/less bass, treble, middle, etc) is really nice and has made a noticeable difference in the quality. Based on what I've read, this was a very recent addition to the QC45s and was much needed.<br/><br/>However, there are a couple of issues.<br/><br/>One of the most annoying things that was proven TRUE from the negative reviews is this: whenever I'm connected to both my laptop and my phone, if I'm listening to my laptop audio through the QC45s, there are little lapses/missteps in audio every couple of minutes. They are quick, but they are annoyingly noticeable because they are frequent. And this is a consistent problem. THE SOLUTION is to disconnect your phone through the Bose Music app if you plan to use your computer audio for the day (i.e. a long workday). If you disconnect your phone, you'll eventually have to reconnect (of course), but it will stay connected to your laptop and the audio has been perfect with this strategy. Small, but annoying nonetheless.<br/><br/>Another thing: it's not easy to switch between the laptop and the phone audio through the Bose Music app. It seems like my laptop takes 'precedence' when I turn on the headset (it remembers both), so if I want to switch to my phone audio, I have to go into the app and turn off the laptop connection manually. I wish the headset was more intuitive/there was a quicker way to change.<br/><br/>Sound quality is very comparable to the QC35 IIs (perhaps because of the ability to manually edit the different levels of sound in the app), just as comfortable, and honestly look a lot better.<br/><br/>TLDR; I think these are bit overhated, I've liked them and look forward to continuing to use them (and hopefully to Bose continuing to update them and improve the QOL and usage). I do agree that if you don't care about the aesthetic (QC45 looks much better than QC 35 II in my opinion), you would have a very similar experience with both of these.</span>

<span>I am going to have to go with the QC45's for noise canceling but the Sony is better on sound.  Much better.  I am writing this review because I really struggled with which pair to buy.  Ended up trying both, so I hope this helps others who are on the fence.  First it is worth noting that I had to return the Sony's because they hurt my ears.  There is something somewhat pointy behind the cloth and it kept pressure on my outer ear.  Got really uncomfortable after wearing for 15 minutes or so.  Also, there was something wrong with the Bluetooth.  The sound was lacking and hollow like you were listening in a barrel.  It only did this over Bluetooth, not when using the cord.  For these reasons I returned them.  I read all the reviews that were available on the QC45 and they all basically said the same thing.  Noise canceling is awesome.  Sound quality is lacking - especially the base.  I can definitely confirm this is true.  Having compared both headsets in the same listening conditions and same music, it is very obvious.  First, the QC45 noise canceling is just better.  It muted out my droning refrigerator whereas the Sony didn't quite do as well.  Don't get me wrong, though, the Sony noise canceling is excellent.  The QC45 is just a little better.  I can also confirm the QC45 has a slight "white noise" sound when the room is quiet.  But it does not bother me and is no worse than my previous JVC noise canceling headphones.  It is actually kinda soothing.  I can confirm that there is more room in the QC45s.  They do not hurt my ears.  I am not having the weird hollow sounding Bluetooth issues on the QC45 that I experienced with the Sony's.<br/><br/>But when it comes to listening to music, this is where the Sony's do a much better job.  I want to be clear that the issue for me is primarily the lack of base.  I know I read this was an issue, but I expected that the QC45s  would still have good base, and it was the brain thumping base folks who were the ones commenting it was lacking base.  I suspected it might be just fine for my needs.  I have to be honest here folks.... the base is just NOT there.  Its just not.  Not only is the base not there, the folks at Bose definitely tune these on the bright side.  The treble is just a little too high for me at the volume I like to listen at.  You can turn the volume down and this subsides, but that is a poor way to have to deal with headphones that are tuned just one way - bright.  Bose really blew it here.  The lack of base at the bright highs could have been easlily solved if I could have adjusted them via the Bose app....but no, the marketing folks had to make them look like the "cheaper model" compared to the 700's.  Wake up Bose.  Nobody likes the same kind of sound.  An equalizer is an absolute must.  You are and will continue to lose business on the QC45's unless you release an upgrade that allows QC45 folks to access the same type of equalizer that the 700 folks have.  Just sayin......<br/><br/>The other annoying things for me are the inability to quickly check the battery life and the music pause when you remove the headphones.  The Sony's let you check battery life with a quick button push.  I used this feature all the time.  Not so on the QC45's.  You have to log into your phone app to see this.  Well this does no good when you are working on your laptop.  Switching back and forth between laptop listening and phone listening was a bit more seamless and easy on the Sony's, too.  The music pause that was available on the Sony's turned out to be really useful.  I found myself taking the headphones on and off a lot during the work day.  Pausing whatever was streaming was great.  That great feature is missing on the QC45's.  Overall I have to say both were great.  My advice is go with the QC45 if noise canceling is most important.  Go with the Sony's if the sound quality is more important.</span>

<span>From a comfort perspective these are still far better than any other I have tried. That said the pads are thinner than the QC35s. Also instead of different levels of noise cancelation you now have an "aware" feature that just enables an external mic so you can hear what's going on around you. Unfortunately its only a few months in and that feature on my headset is starting to crackle. Also loud noises or coughing easily overwhelm the noise canceling and they will make a popping noise. Other than that the sound is good. DONT get these if you want quality microphone output. It basically sounds like you are speaking through a tin can. Overall I like these headphones but some...one who should no longer work at Bose tried to make a new and improved version of the QC35s and just made them worse. Closest comparable I could find was the Sony WH-1000XM4 and they were not as comfortable.</span>

<span>Closed Headphone:<br/>1st: JVC HARX700: Spacious, clear. Well rounded. Maybe a bit sharp and less warm. Very comfortable.<br/>2nd: Alesis DRP100: Warmer than JVC HARX700, but less spacious. Excellent isolation. Comfortable.<br/>3rd: Beyerdynamic DT 240 PRO: Very balanced and warm. Not comfortable due to on-ear design.<br/>4th: Audio-Technica ATH-M20X: Thin sounding. Worst performer.<br/><br/>Open Headphone:<br/>1st: Philips SHP9500: Best sound quality to me. Extremely comfortable, but little loose fitting.<br/>2nd: Samson Technologies SR850: Very close runner up to the SHP9500. Very comfortable.<br/>3rd: AKG Pro Audio K240: Higher impedance, so little harder to drive. Less open sounding. Definitely a step behind the above two.</span>

<span>Sound and noise cancellation are fine. They get a little warm around your ears after wearing for a while. Build quality is not the best. The plug on the pair I purchased started coming apart. Alesis customer support was helpful and did an exchange by mail. They said that the old pair would go to their quality control team to review. Now this second pair is getting a hole in the cord.</span>

<span>These are pretty alright. Can wear them for a few hours without getting uncomfortable but they do get there eventually. Sound quality is average/fine - but these are really not listening headphones. These are well suited for drummers in recording and rehearsal, though I was surprised that they’re not much more noise isolating than other closed back headphones like the Audio Technica M series. Not nearly as muffling as a $5 set of lawnmower earmuffs, which is what I was hoping for. Still, totally usable, no issues with click bleed, so these are staying wired up next to the house drum kit for now.<br/><br/>I’ve seen complaints of component failure e.g. losing sound in one ear, but I’ve not experienced that at all after maybe a year, though that is with relatively I nfrequent and not punishing use.</span>
