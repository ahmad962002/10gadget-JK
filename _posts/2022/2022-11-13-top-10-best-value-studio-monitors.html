When it’s time to upgrade to serious 2-way professional studio monitors, you’re ready for the Eris E5. With woven composite low-frequency transducers, low-mass silk-dome tweeters, responsive class AB amplification, and professional acoustic-adjustment controls, the compact Eris E5 represents an outstanding value In its class. It includes RF shielding, current-output limiting, over-temperature protection, and subsonic protection, and unlike comparably priced studio monitors, it has controls for simulating different listening environments and flattening frequency response to enable accurate mixing.

<blockquote><em><div class="a-row a-spacing-small review-data"><span class="a-size-base review-text review-text-content" data-hook="review-body">
<span>I purchased this Eris E7 XT after purchasing two nearly identical Eris E66, but with an extra bass driver. These are comparable to my old Behringer B2031Ps, but with smaller bass driver &amp; amps at nearly the same price range. Made by Fender but based in Louisiana for hardware, Germany for software llke Behringer used to be but no longer are. Much better quality drivers &amp; cabinetry but with class A/B amplifiers instead of Class D as is so common in powered speakers. Better depth &amp; tonal quality but not as solid power wise as my old Behringers. Just added a month later: I ended up purchasing five of this series, the 7s, the 8s with one additional E266. I've read a ton of reviews &amp; I like this series, how they look &amp; especially how they sound in a very complicated surround setup. There is no question, the E8s sound the best of the bunch but the E266s don't sacrifice much using smaller woofers. My 20 year old Truth Behringers play more solid with much fuller range using the 260 watt power pack, these sound finer, more finished but the E7s sound far less powered/bass diminshment compared to my 20 year old &amp; worn original wunders. The fivesome creates an astonishing quality sound field, especially anywhere near their price range using an ancient Pioneer Elite HTR implemented with pre-outs.</span>

<span>I think it's important to emphasize. If you're buying these for music listening—as I am for my current application, in a 2nd home—be prepared: These monitors will not knock your socks—or any other item of attire—off. Even though I'm accustomed to some ridiculous hifi standards, I was at first a little surprised at the non-aggressive sound here. It really is a "flat" monitor with a surprisingly true-to-life sonic profile. I'm listening to a recent recording of Mozart's opera Le Nozze di Figaro, and it sounds like it does at the Metropolitan Opera here in fabulous Manhattan USA, only—of course—quieter. The fact is, this is what orchestral/vocal music sounds like in a concert hall. It does not knock your socks off. It sounds like a live performance of instruments and singers. I'm moderately impressed. At this price point you can't likely do better. NOTE I'm using this monitor with a Bluetooth streaming device, the Emotiva BTR-1 Virtual Copper ($80 at Emotiva.com). Works great. All you need are these two monitors and a Bluetooth streaming device, and you have a very compact—and honestly pretty wonderful—stereo system. If you have young ones, this is a good way to expose them to the true sound of music. I might revise this review after a week or two of exposure to the sound, but I am impressed. I mean, this pair of monitors cost me under $250. Not to be too obvious: "Monitor" means the amplifier is inside each speaker. They are self-contained and require only what is generally referred to as a "source"—these days, usually some species of Bluetooth streaming device. Finally: No a pair of these will not run a dance party or fill a big room. I mean, check the specs. These are small-ish monitors.</span>

<span>I have owned PreSonus products for some time and have wondered at the incredible bang for the buck this company brings to the table.<br/><br/>I purchased a pair of these along with their subwoofer as I have done with other models in the past.<br/><br/>These monitors are powerful and can handle anything you throw at them.<br/><br/>Would I buy them again? At this point, I am not sure.<br/><br/>So far, I have spent hours trying to tune them to the room. Getting the highs and lows were easy enough. But the mid-range has been an absolute pain in the butt. At first, it was horrible. Muddy with no detail whatsoever.<br/><br/>Remember these aren't speakers. They are monitors and each speaker and the sub have a multitude of switches and dials to get things right. So, you are going to be running from one to another to test and re-test.<br/><br/>Currently, I am about 85% locked in. I am certain I will get to 90 to 95% with more tinkering.<br/><br/>For those who want to get an idea of what's involved, download the manuals for them as well as the sub. You will also need to search on their site for their article on a 2:1 set-up.<br/><br/>It is hard to beat up on these considering the price. But once you add the cost of the sub and stands, you are getting up there.</span>

<span>This seemed to be quite the issue for some purchasers.  I can tell you I was extremely curious as to what I was going to get.  Lucky for me, I set them up on my PC Desk Top for Multi-Media use, turned them on and listened intently with my ear to the speakers.  They are dead quiet friends.<br/>Now I am running a pair of these from my PC then to my SMSL Su-9n DAC, then to the E7's.  I used high quality shielded XLR cables from my DAC to the Monitors.  I used high quality shielded USB Cable from my PC to my DAC.  My electricity is filtered for noise and my cable routing is clean with minimal overlaps.  Whether that made any difference or not I dont know.  I only know what I can hear which is NOTHING.<br/><br/>Friends, the sound is very pleasing for me.  The first things I noticed were a very distinct upgraded stereo seperation, crystal clear Mids and Highs, and a noticeable spatial feel as if I am in a Concert Hall.  The bass which many comment on,  like PREGO, its in there.<br/><br/>I feel like that Cat who ate the Bird.  Cheers.</span>

<span>These sound great for the price! Not as loud as I was expecting a 100 watt monitor to be. Don't get me wrong, they can get plenty loud, but my 40 watt Mackies blow this thing out of the water in terms of sheer volume. The Mackies are 8-inch speakers as opposed to 5-inch for these though. I haven't tried the USB but plug in via XLR to my audio card on the computer and it works just fine. For the price these are a great deal.</span>

<span>Saying this right from the start, these are $150 monitors, you are searching in the lower end of a market that extends well into the thousands of dollars/speaker, so know what you;re getting into.  Compared to my Rokit RP10-3's , and my Presonus Sceptre S8's, these really aren't that great, but those will both set you back $1000-$1500 respectively. so at 1/10th the price, how do these do.?<br/><br/>At this price point, I have to say these speakers sound absolutely remarkable, surprisingly strong bass given their size, but again, 5 inch speakers, check your expectations. The midbass is really Excellent considering the price point, and the mid/mid-highs are pretty good as well in terms of clarity and volume... in regards to this price range. I find these a bit fatiguing to listen to high volumes for long periods of time if  compared to my presonus's,<br/><br/>They sound pretty flat to my ear at the non-room corrected setting, but if you don't have treatment material between them and the wall behind them ( My mounts leave about 14 inches from cone to wall, mileage and mounts may vary.) these can become very harsh sounding because of the reflection.<br/><br/>For the money though, These are surprisingly transparent, even though they can only produce 48k sound, If you;re looking for a good ser of monitors that really do have a ton of power. these were a pretty good buy, I'd buy them again for their current application.</span>

<span>These little Presonus speakers replaced some Bose we use for a stereo in our kitchen. We also have the matching subwoofer. The three components make a really nice, flat response stereo sound for listening to music in the kitchen.

<span>I like the size and they can rock out the room too and it's a quality sound. I almost gave them 4 stars for Sound Quality but they are much closer to perfection than 80% and I like to be objective most times but you gotta think of it this way. I really like them and are they the JBL ProLine $1500 each. No but they are pretty nice. That's a hundred for both speakers. And the fact that they are Branded by a High Quality Operation should speak to the Comminity Of Music Production that surrounds us with wonderful products and a rich history that they share so freely and ask only that we consider their servises and products. And keep in mind all that goes into being one of the greats in this field. A lot goes into every little thing they do. and after to. I am very happy to spend my money with the folks at Presonus.

<span>I will update this once hooked up but wanted to mention that the package had a impact hole 4"x3" that went thru outer box, inner box and finally the actual speaker box. Theres just a hint of mark on the speaker itself about 1" long. Interesting is that its not visible from outside because Amazon had taped up the outside hole with 2" black box tape. Update later if decide to return it. NOT impressed with Amazon putting tape over the hole but maybe it was a precaution, IDK but it means you could not see the the box damage from the outside.<br/><br/>Update: No issues with speakers - they are great.

<span>I had purchased Creative Pebble speakers as a place holder when I did a PC build in 2020. They were adequate but I wanted a larger sound stage to be more immersive. After a few weeks of research, reading reviews, listening to some audio tests (with a grain of salt in my ears) I decided on these for a few reasons. Price to performance and clarity of sound. I did not what I consider muddy sound with base overwhelming all sound.  These were a great purchase and have greatly improved the gaming experience, listening to music and consuming video content as well. In games the sound stage was such an improvement several in games such as CP 2077 and Tomb Raider series was like a new introduction to the audio aspects of the games. Highly recommended for such use.  Very I happy I went with these over Audio Eng A2+.<br/><br/>Pros: Good balance of base and treble which can be adjusted. Front facing headphone jack port, Option for RCA or TRS connection for L/R channels. True stereo sound immersion (turn Char head left, sound from right speaker only, turn head right, sound from left speaker in-game. )Dimensions can fit easily with limited space and a 3.5" Sub with 1" tweeter. Build quality at price point (MDF except for front as it feels for the front panel).<br/><br/>Cons: Would prefer High / Low adjustment on front of speaker or the side.</span>

<span>I've owned a pair of Cannon TLS-822s, three pair of Polks, a pair of Klipsch, and a Klipsch 2.1 promedia's as well as other speakers in my lifetime. I've got to say these speakers sound awesome. I think as far as depth of sound and imaging I like them better than the promedia's. I live in an apartment and the sub-woofer was a little much at times leading me to turn it down. I'm hearing things out of these speakers I haven't heard for years. I'm now looking for good recordings of my favorite music. These speakers are plenty loud and have plenty of base. I would say that if one needs to have wall shattering base at the expense of clarity and imaging than find a set with a sub or add a sub to these if you can. I watched a video on you tube where someone had the woofers bouncing around like crazy. I was a little concerned with all that movement. I have had these loud enough to get in trouble and they weren't giggling around like jello. They weren't moving hardly at all. The cabinet is a wood material. These are stout speakers. Bravo Pioneer!</span>

<span>To preface:<br/>- I have been producing for 2 years<br/>- I have been using headphones prior to this purchase (MDRXB-950N1)<br/>- I prefer bass heavy music with good melodics<br/><br/>I was pleasantly surprised by these speakers, I wasn't sure what to expect. The frequency range it quotes is accurate and the monitors are powerful. I have an iMac and the sound output is amazing. The highs and mids are god-like for this size and the bass, although only going as low as 70hz, is more than enough for levelling and mixing ( bass is punchy and loud for my liking). I recommend these for those starting off, as you will immediately see a difference in your mixes.<br/><br/>In other quirks, this monitor gets louder than I expected and the subwoofer can actually handle loud volumes as if it were already broken in  (yay). I have this in a 10*10 room, and it fills the room with sound, although it sounds much better if you have it at eye-level likes it is meant too.<br/><br/>The only drawback, in my opinion, is that I get the feeling that the headphone jack on the monitors is of low quality, my headphones sounded very muffled coming out of the monitor.<br/><br/>I really recommend these studio monitors, they are amazing for a bass head like me and my rap beats. (btw it is much smaller than I expected honestly, not a bad thing though.)</span>

<span>These speakers do not have a "flat" frequency response. Almost, but there's a 1-2db boost at 2.6K and again at 4K and above. It can easily be dealt with with an equalizer.

<span>These are better than anything from Logitech and especially all the no-name Chinese junk speakers at this price but that's not saying much. They will play rather loud for their size without completely distorting or falling apart which could be a plus for some.<br/><br/>First off you power these up and there's an audible kind of digital hiss regardless of what you have connected or not connected. The Class-D digital audio amplifier is obviously low quality if you can plainly hear the digital hash. You have to be close to the speakers to hear it but these are, after all, desktop speakers so you're often going to be close. I can plainly hear the hiss sitting in my office chair. That's a hard FAIL Mackie that your competition doesn't suffer from.<br/><br/>Next up better desktop monitors are bi-amped with separate amplifiers for the woofer and tweeter and an electronic crossover. Not these. They use a simple passive crossover for the tweeter and just a basic 2 channel low quality class-D amplifier. They're also not very phase accurate in the process resulting in weird spatial imaging.<br/><br/>Unlike in the PreSonus E3.5, the tweeter dome is also unprotected and could easily be damaged by curious fingers especially from a child. Mackie seems to be assuming these will be used in a pristine adult studio environment?<br/><br/>Comparing these to the slightly more expensive and near identically sized PreSonus E3.5 monitors the Mackie speakers will play louder without falling apart but they're otherwise similar. Some might argue the PreSonus are arguably more accurate if you don't push them hard. The PreSonus also have a front panel input jack which the Mackie speakers lack.<br/><br/>Comparing both to the similarly sized JBL 104-BT there's NO comparison. The JBL's reach much lower with real instead of fake tubby bass, have a more balanced sound, and are much less fatiguing to listen to. They're also much heavier with higher build quality and offer more features including Bluetooth and mixing more simultaneous input sources. They won't, however, play as loud.<br/><br/>JBL (a Harmon company) has massive R&amp;D resources that shame Mackie and PreSonus so it's no surprise they can make much better desktop monitors but they are, admittedly, more expensive. Still, as a consumer what matters most with speakers is how they sound. And, of the 3, the Mackie CR3-Xs play the loudest but it's a harsh boom box sort of loud. The slightly more expensive PreSonus are more polite and don't hiss like the Mackie but they fall apart at higher volumes and are even more fatiguing to listen to than the Mackie speakers. Ultimately if you value sound quality and features the JBL 104-BTs completely crush both the Mackie and PreSonus speakers despite being very similar in size.<br/><br/>There are also lots of posts regarding the Mackie CR3-X's failing just outside of their minimal1 year warranty. So that's something else to keep in mind. I usually don't recommend extended warranties but with these failure prone speakers it might prove to be a good option as Mackie seems to have made them as cheaply as possible in China hoping most at least don't fail in the first year or customers toss them in the trash when they fail. Once upon a time Mackie was a really high quality manufacture but not anymore as these speakers clearly demonstrate.</span>

<span>Searching for the best Active Bookshelf Speakers was challenging. There are a large selection of different brands and just reading the reviews is not enough. The price range also has a large gap difference. So many questions? If your looking for a pair of Active (self-powered) Speakers, hopefully this review will help with your search!<br/>&gt;Price:<br/>The cost was only $100, Great Price for what it offers! The set-up was also extremely easy.<br/>&gt;Sound:<br/>Pros- It’s a two way speaker. The highs and mid range sound excellent. The Bass with the 3”woofer was surprisingly deep but not overwhelming deep, just enough.<br/>(Note: if your using them for a turntable, I noticed that the closer you have the speakers to the turntable, the Bass gets deeper.)<br/>Con- the only one thing I wish it had would be the ability to control the Tones, the Highs and Bass. But for the cost, I can understand why it didn’t have those options. If you pay for more expensive units, I’m sure that option will be available. I honestly couldn’t find any 1 thing I didn’t like about these speakers.<br/>Overall, I am completely satisfied with the Sound Quality and I recommend them to anyone looking for Speakers on a budget.<br/>&gt;Thickness:<br/>The overall size is perfect and truly is defined as a Bookshelf Speaker. The quality is well built. I actually liked the Green Stripe but it would have been nice to have different color stripe options!<br/>I hope this was helpful, if not and you just want more info. Type in the product name (CR3-X) in YouTube and you will find other great reviews.<br/>Happy Shopping!</span>

Building on JBL legacy of high-quality sound performance, the 3 series Mk II represents an upgrade of the impressive LSR3 series. These compact, professional quality, powered studio monitors retain the LSR3 series' image control waveguide for incredible detail and imaging, and the broad sweet spot that means you get optimal sound even off-axis. The Mk II series now features updated high-frequency (HF) and low-frequency (LF) transducers, which respectively provide optimized damping for superior transient response and greater linearity that allows impressively deep bass with lower harmonic distortion. Upgrades also include new boundary equalization (EQ), which restores neutral LF response when speakers are placed on the work surface and adjacent walls. Hear for yourself why JBL is legendary in sound performance and quality.

<span>At normal listening levels -- below pain/OSHA hearing damage threshold -- this speaker is fantastic.<br/><br/>On-axis performance measured from six feet away in a room with a hard floor followed a Harman target small room curve. Individual near field measurements of the tweeter and woofer were flat along the Harman down sloping curve. I didn't check off-axis because off-axis performance will follow the design engineering conducted by JBL. In this case, the primary purpose of testing the on-axis performance is to see if I received a product with a manufacturing defect. For example, one of the components in the speaker could have been damaged during manufacturing or transport.<br/><br/>Like all stereo channel speakers, you'd need to add a separate low frequency system if you want complete hi-fi sound but that's a limitation imposed by listening to music inside a room not the speaker. If you don't want to mess with that complexity this speaker will play down to 50Hz to give the impression of full sound for casual listening.<br/><br/>I'm tempted to say this speaker is as good as it gets for residential living space sized rooms. I won't go as far as that because speakers can be designed to produce different sound fields for different applications. But for a regular speaker this speaker is really (really) good. Or maybe I can say it this way: if you listen to this speaker and don't like it you can be sure the problem is not the speaker. Maybe the speaker is sitting in the wrong part of the room (e.g. jammed into a corner or up against a wall), maybe your signal source is bad, maybe you want an entirely different type of speaker, or maybe one of the speaker components has a manufacturing defect or got damaged during transport. Which brings up a point, you could use this speaker as a reference to trouble shoot your system. That's a big deal because speakers are normally the weakest link in a home system.<br/><br/>If you had an expensive stereo system set up by someone else and you wanted to find out if it was actually good you could buy these speakers to compare. There are a lot of very expensive stereo speakers out there that aren't as good as these speakers. Which brings up another point, if you practice listening to these speakers you will be better equipped to identify snake oil. You can use these speakers to teach yourself how to not get sent down rabbit holes by well-meaning audiophiles who don't know what they're talking about. There are some well-meaning audiophiles out there who are unwittingly influenced by aspects of the speaker that have nothing to do with the sound of the speaker. They sell you snake oil without knowing they're selling you snake oil, they're innocent dupes. In the context of audio performance, you would need to have a really good reason to buy speakers more expensive than these and you would need to be sure you knew exactly -- through personal listening experience -- why you were spending that extra money. On the other hand, if you want a pretty speaker that looks beautiful in your room then absolutely spend the extra money. Just make sure the pretty speaker sounds as good as these JBLs. These JBLs can be your reference.</span>

<span>I bought these to go with the Pioneer turntable I had ordered. I have absolutely no complaints. The turntable/speaker combination sounds really good. The speakers are capable of decent volume without generating feedback, despite residing on the same table as the turntable (it helps that the turntable is built like a tank, with excellent isolation). The bass response is decent, even though the speakers' frequency range bottoms out at 70 Hz.<br/><br/>I have to correct something that appears in another review, though. With these speakers, left is indeed left, and right is right. You don't have to reverse the speakers to get the proper stereo image. I confirmed this by checking the same recording on different systems; unless the stereo channels of the other (digital) source have been reversed (which has been known to happen), the guitar that opens Linda Ronstadt's cover of "Back in the USA" comes out of the channel it is supposed to with these speakers placed as labelled (that is, with the left speaker placed on the left when facing the listener).</span>

<span>There's a lot of people giving grief over these not being accurate or loud enough for their music production setup. Well, all I have to ask is...what were you expecting from 2x FOUR inch monitors for $150?<br/><br/>Can you master on them? No. Can you pick up resonant frequencies between 30hz and 35hz in your sub bass? No. Can you put on a warehouse rave using just these two monitors? No.<br/><br/>BUT you CAN practice mixing techniques and transitions on your DJ deck with these. You can also use them as cheap yet solid and beautiful reference speakers to the eight-inch behemoths most producers and engineers go for anyway. All things considered, the sound coming from both these tiny 4'' monitors is actually really great and loud enough for any studio or office space.<br/><br/>That said...Pioneer had the awful idea of implementing a "standby" mode on these speakers in which they only work as expected when they are actively receiving an audio signal. You'll actually encounter this the very moment you turn on your speakers for the first time and notice the sound abruptly cut in.<br/><br/>The way it works is that after an undetermined period of silence (an hour?), they "go to sleep". While this sounds like a great way to save on your electric bill, it's much more annoying in practice. If you start playing a song while it's still on standby, the first second will be cutoff before the speakers realize there is a signal. This is a non-issue while you're DJ mixing as there will always be music playing, but if you are constantly dropping in and out of your workstation throughout the day, you're going to get really annoyed fast. Sure, it's just a quick second, but it's a frustration non-the-less and I will never understand why Pioneer did this on purpose.<br/><br/>If you set your expectations accordingly and are not using these as general PC speakers, I think you'll find these to be an incredible bargain. Otherwise, if you are a "professional" DJ or music producer/engineer, do the logical (smart) choice and get real 6''+ studio monitors that aren't marketed as DJ hardware.</span>

<span> Pros...<br/>5 stars in most catagories..<br/>Some have claimed bass not good enough...<br/>It is heavy on bass and full range for a two way speaker! 40 watts sound like 50-60 in your average living room. I mean loud and clear. This video doesn't do these speakers justice like actual hearing. Pioneer DJ gear has stepped their game up for dj controllers and the DM-40-W's are the perfect complement for any dj who needs to hear and feel the mix in their face. Be sure to get adjustable stands. I saved $57 getting these used but would pay full price if I had to... If your as serious about djing as me? You will love these.<br/>Cons...<br/>I run a recording studio as well...<br/>I have recorded on legendary speakers in the past... Are these as good as KRK's? Almost. KRK's will cost you double for same size and similar sound. Most djs and studio engineers are using other speakers for added sound. I use a soundbar and DClass Powered Harbinger Speaker for shows... Really is the best speakers for price range.<br/>*Bonus experience....<br/>Accidently dropped the line speaker (the second right speaker) on hard tile floor face down on the first night set up, was scared i broke it... Nope.. these things are 4/5 sturdy. I have maxed the sound on speaker level volume and they held. I never max the output on my controller or track recorder. No one should..</span>

<h2 style="text-align: center;">FAQS</h2>
<h3><h3>Which monitor is best for studio?</h3></h3>
    

For a studio monitor, it is important to find one that has low harmonic distortion so that you can hear the true sound of your music. The Yamaha HS8S has some of the lowest harmonic distortion levels on the market, making it a great option for studio monitors.
<h3><h3>Is it worth buying studio monitors?</h3></h3>
    

If you're a music producer, engineer, or just somebody who wants to hear your music the way it was meant to be heard, then yes - studio monitors are worth buying.
<h3><h3>Are studio monitors worth it in untreated room?</h3></h3>
    

Studio monitors can be helpful in an untreated room, but ultimately the room's acoustics will play a bigger role in the quality of your audio. If you're looking to improve your audio quality and don't have the means to treat your room, studio monitors are a good place to start.
<h3><h3>Do I need 1 or 2 studio monitors?</h3></h3>
    


It depends on your needs. Generally, one studio monitor is enough for most applications, but if you need greater stereo separation or a more accurate representation of the audio track, then two studio monitors may be better.
