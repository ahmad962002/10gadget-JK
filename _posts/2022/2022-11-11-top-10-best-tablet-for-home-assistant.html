<span>This tablet was to replace aging Samsung. I experienced a few minor issues; the device was not detected for the automatic transfer of apps and data, sometimes it is VERY sluggish!, the screen refresh often takes a great deal of time, you have to validate 2 times to access it (even using the same values for the check).<br/><br/>Something very odd, Lenovo showed the warranty was only valid until Dec 2021. I received the tablet on 13 Sept. 2021. Was this an item which had been returned? I did not purchase a 'refreshed device' that I know of...<br/><br/>While there were a few issues, the primary problem was it would not load the Kindle app. I tried loading it from the play store, and side-loading it. No Joy. I tried all the suggestions, clearing the play store cache, factory reset, power cycle, let the battery drain, and recharge it, with no luck.<br/><br/>I tried to reach support but could not find someone to help with the tablet. There is a page which allows one to select the table from drop downs, but no way to get to support for the tablet.<br/><br/>I started looking at sites, and there were complaints about apps not loading from 2018 (on a different Lenovo table). The point is, Lenovo seems unable to constantly create tables which will load apps.<br/><br/>From my experience, I will avoid this crappy tablet and all from Lenovo.</span>

<span>I absolutely love this Kindle Fire. I have all the older ones all the way down to the very first reader with the push buttons but this one far exceeded my expectations. And the battery life is simply amazing I'll watch a movie all day long on it and it uses 5% battery. And the screen quality is beautiful if I had any complaint at all which I really don't is that I cannot download Vudu on the tablet but it can get Disney Plus and Paramount and obviously Netflix. And it's a good size like 8x10 somewhere around there so I would highly highly highly recommend this tablet it's thin sleek and smooth .good job Amazon</span>

<span>I bought a no-name tablet years ago that quickly became too slow to use with the internet. I wound up using it for games only.  So after accumulating some Amazon rewards points and with it being on sale, I decided to "splurge" on a fire tablet for a total of $5.74 (after the rewards points).  I researched heavily to ensure that I would be able to add Google Play onto the tablet, and then bought it. After watching a video on Youtube, I got Google Play loaded, which is great..but Amazon makes it incredibly difficult to change anything about the tablet to make it more of an Android-like experience. For example, downloading a launcher from Google Play didn't "take". I learned that when you're buying the tablet, you must uncheck the box about syncing it with your Amazon account in order for you to be able to use the Fire Toolbox, which would allow you to customize your tablet to a more Android-like experience. I didn't uncheck the box, so now I can't use Fire Toolbox to change the tablet to my liking. :( (This will not stop me from trying, though!) For example, the home screen is CLUTTERED with apps as soon as you get this tablet. You can't remove anything pre-installed, and I absolutely HATE the upper part giving me all these "suggestion" apps. WTH??? I like my home screen to be pretty "clean", not a mess of apps, and worse, "advertisements" for other apps!<br/><br/>Speaking of which..I opted to get the tablet a little cheaper by allowing for "promotions"..which occur on the lock screen. Only happens at that time, but still annoying. It gets "old" after awhile. You start to feel like you're being spammed all the time.  The Fire Toolbox would have allowed me to remove that for free, otherwise you have to pay $15 to opt out.<br/><br/>As for performance, the screen and speed seem to be decent. I've had some "spotty" issues, but that could be my internet.<br/><br/>I haven't used it to play music, yet, but the sound seems to be good.<br/><br/>Overall, my gripe is the lack of customization and Amazon's insistence that you use their apps over anything else. Again, you can manage to download apps from Google Play by getting the apk's to four files, but that doesn't mean all the apps you download and install will work in your favor (a different launcher, for example).  If you can manage to get Fire Toolbox on the tablet, that's a different story.  Me, I'm in the process of finding out how to remove the home screen clutter since I can't get a different launcher to work. I don't know why Amazon thinks it looks appealing to have a mass of apps stare you in the face when you open the tablet. It's terribly distracting and unappealing, but then they also have app "suggestions" that they throw at you without your permission, so...<br/><br/>Lastly, the tablet feels more flimsy than I thought it would be. My last $99 tablet had far more weight and a more substantial feel. This one feels like it could break at any moment. Yes, it's very light..and a few times just upon picking it up, the plastic frame "snapped" in the back. Not good.<br/><br/>Overall, for what I wound up paying for it, it is a decent tablet..but between the forced use of Amazon apps, the bloatware and the cluttered screen and flimsy build, it's definitely not a "high end" tablet, and obviously doesn't pretend to be. You get what you pay for..but for now, it serves its purpose.</span>

<span>I traded "up" from my older Fire Tablet.  Used the older to watch movies I had on SD's.  When I got the new tablet it would not recognize my movies SD.  They were in MP4 format.  So I called customer and got a whirlwind of agents that border on incompetent claiming they "knew"  but did not. They had me do a reset wiping out all I already had downloaded from previous tablet.  That did NOTHING, same  issue.  Next agent told me that I could ONLY use one of two "approved" SD's,which I knew was untrue from a latter agent.  Then I get an email from unknown customer agent that the SD's had to be formatted only FAT32 not exFat32 which is in direct contradiction to the tablet help files.  So on and on with numerous calls with some  "pretending" to be advanced Tech support but did not know about formatting in FAT32 or other from9 am until late at night.  One was supposed to call back in 20 minutes did not.  Another when I asked what country they were calling from ( asked because of the time zone difference) said that was rude and just hung up the phone.<br/><br/>Now I find out it is supposed to be a Generation 11 2021 table but when you look in the "about Tablet" in the Setting it states Gen 10.  You also cannot use  the "Play Store" but only their App Store keeping it Proprietary like computers did 40 years ago.  And it is not really a true Android.<br/><br/>All in all this tablet is not worth the trouble unless you just content with Amazon shopping and Prime watching.  After a supervisor is "supposed"to call me back  June 2 ( three days) and see if they resolved the MP4 SD issue I will return it unless resolved.  I have 17 - 32 gb SD's each with 30+ movies on each (510) I have been watching on my previous Fire Tablet.  I will be darned if I am going to save all those, reformat the disk,  and reinstall them on the disk for a crappy new Fire tablet and worse customer Service for it.<br/><br/>UPDATE:!!!  Well the supervisor that was supposed to call me never has.  So I called and got another"Expert" that has done exactly the same thing all the rest did and was going to send me another tablet until I seen in the reviews that others  have had the same issues.  You cannot use this tablet unless you format the SD in their machine and then transfer whatever you want to put on it.<br/><br/>Now do want to even return my "Gift Card" I applied to this order.  So they want to keep my old table, keep my gift card. And I have to drive 35 miles to return this shitty table.<br/><br/>HERE IS THE AMAZON CON.  THEY DID AN "UPDATE" AND CHANGED THE WORDS GENERATION 10 TO "TABLET 10 (11TH GENERATION)"  AND NOW THEY WANT TO KEEP MY OLD TABLET AND THE $30 CREDIT FOR SENDING IT IN .</span>

<span>I bought this tablet because I don't have one and the price was great.  My wife has an older one and seems to like it quite a bit.  The problem is, it really seems to only be good for reading, streaming video or light web surfing.  When I read, I like actual, physical books.  If I'm watching video, I have a 65" OLED TV with surround sound.  Worst case scenario, I have a 14" 2-in-1 laptop I can use.  A 10" screen isn't really big enough for video, IMHO.<br/>As for web surfing, the only browser available is Silk, which I had never heard of.  And while it works on a basic level, it doesn't not provide me with the customization and options I get with other browsers.  For example, I can't set it to clear cache upon exit.  Nor is there an option for private browsing.<br/>Because this device works on a 'forked' version of Android and not a 'skin', the only app store that really works is the Amazon app store, which is sorely lacking in terms of what is available for this device.  I couldn't download Firefox, nor any other that I might prefer - not even Chrome.  I couldn't download The Weather Channel.  It took forever to find my favorite game.  I finally had to search by the name of the developer.  Those are just a couple of examples, but I literally spent hours trying to figure out a way around that.  I'm a former IT guy and things like that drive me nuts.<br/>One minor irritant is that I can't choose a version of the keyboard that displays the numbers above the letters.  I can do that with my phone.  It seems like an odd oversight for Amazon not to include that.  So, any time I have to enter a password, I have to shift to the numbers/characters, then shift back.  And I have to do that more than once while entering a password.  It just takes longer and seems unnecessary.<br/>There is one other minor irritant for me, which is shutting down and booting up.  You have to hold the power button down for a while, then wait for it to respond.  And, while shutting down is pretty quick, booting up takes a bit longer than I would like.  I know that's a niggling little thing. but my Windows laptop is quicker and easier (again, IMHO).<br/>On the plus side, I was able to download Outlook and Office, as well as a few other minor things.  I haven't had time to finish setting up my mailbox in Outlook, so I can't comment on that yet.  Neither have I transferred any Office files, so I'll have to reserve comment on that.  Nor have I loaded any of my music to it yet.  I don't stream, I buy what I want and store it electronically on my own devices.  I don't anticipate a problem there, but you never know.<br/>I have not purchased a cover for it yet, but I'm looking at one with the built-in keyboard.  If I'm working in Outlook or Office, I think that will be helpful.  But I don't want anything too bulky, so I'm still mulling that over.  I have also not tried connecting it to an external display (such as an overhead projector), so that will be interesting.  To be honest, I got so frustrated with it at first, that I just set it aside for awhile and haven't gotten back to doing most of those things.<br/>I should note that I purchased it because I thought it would be more compact, lighter, more portable and more convenient than my laptop.  And it would be bigger and easier to use than my Android phone for anything other than voice and text.  Sort of a bridge between the two.  Time will tell.</span>

<span>Picked up several of these on sale to replace our much older outdated 7" tablets that could no longer support the Amazon Shopping app due to insufficient space... Was disappointed to learn that new right out of the box these also upon first boot and setup advised that the Amazon Shopping App was also UNSUPPORTED...and these were supposedly 2020 models!  WTH??<br/><br/>What has become of the Amazon Shopping App larely that it has become so bloated or hardware intensive that it can no longer be supported by its own brand spanking new devices??  Uh Houston we gotta problem...Got these mainly for facility of ease &amp; security while ordering from Amazon and upon setup AM TOLD that I cannot use the Amazon App taking up space on my device's home screen BUT must instead utilize a web browser to place and check on orders, which by the way requires me to constantly reenter my Amazon password via a web browser each and every time...something I was entirely trying to avoid.<br/><br/>This seems utterly ridiculous when it is primarily FOR this very purpose that these devices were and ARE created...to facilitate ease of greater partaking IN &amp; OF Amazon's ecosystem.  Don't get me wrong...the quality of the build of these devices are great, which is why I still gave it 4 stars...just be aware that if you are primarily getting one of these newer devices to upgrade an older one...Caveat Emptor buyer beware that the Amazon App will STILL be unsupported right out of the box on these 2020 models...something that customers should be foretold of upfront...Don't know who's running things over there these days but its not good and it doesn't exactly inspire confidence in a company that once took pride in both its products &amp; its service.  BOTH have been on the decline as of late...can't tell you how many times I received something shipped in a padded envelope that before Amazon woulda shipped it in a box, or an item shipped in a box with absolutely NO packing material to prevent said item from getting banged around in transit.  When ordering gifts for others I now have to wonder if its WORTH the RISK of it arriving damaged or looking too shabby to give to someone VS hunting for and purchasing said item from somewhere else.<br/><br/>And don't get me started about OTHER Amazon devices like fire tv streaming sticks that upon initial setup are now ALMOST FILLED to capacity with bloatware that I simply DO NOT need and won't EVER use and which unfortunately cannot be removed, such as laughingly the Amazon Shopping App (uh that's what I purchased this new Amazon tablet for &amp; strangely cannot use...), Alexa Shopping (kinda redundant), AmazonKIds, Amazon Free Time, Amazon Music (uh that's what I use my Amazon Echo device for...why would I wanna listen to music through my TV (ahem, our HDTV to this day has ghosted image burn from trying to DO exactly that using the Spotify app before getting a dedicated Echo device for said purpose...), Amazon Photos,  Game Circle, Freevee, and on older devices IMdbTV all of which are uninstallable taking up more than half of the devices storage space...slogging down the device and practically rendering it useless in a relatively short time unless you constantly delete the cache of each and every one of these apps which build up whether you use them or not.  Just do a Google query regarding the dreaded INSUFFICIENT SPACE warning regarding these devices and you'll see what I mean...the only remedy being that one must do a factory RESET on said device and go through the whole tedious set-up process at which time during the mandatory update ALL the uninstallable bloatware that caused the problem in the first place is promptly re-installed to your device!<br/><br/>So that's my rant for the day regarding these lovely Amazon devices that we have come to USE, LOVE, &amp; ENJOY!...and some of us RELY on a little too much. 👌</span>

<span>**PLEASE NOTE THAT THIS REVIEW IS FOR A 64G (with ads) ~~ White ~~ Adapter and USB cable Incl<br/>EVEN THOUGH AMAZON IS POSTING THIS IS AS A 32G BLACK**<br/><br/>A GREAT LITTLE TABLET FOR WHAT IT IS.<br/><br/>If you're a diehard Amazon customer like I am, then Amazon devices can't be beat for hooking one up to everything that Amazon World offers. And let's not forget Alexa makes it all even easier.<br/><br/>I never thought I'd need or buy a Fire tablet, since I'm already covered with a new laptop, Kindle Reader, 2 Android tablets, and a Samsung phone. My bases were already covered and my nearly 3,000 Kindle books were accessible in several ways. Prime Video and Music work great on all my existing devices, plus I have 2 regular Firesticks and 1 4K Firestick. So why get a Fire tablet?<br/><br/>Well, my two tablets were made obsolete for Kindle when Amazon recently SOMEHOW deregistered both of them from my account and I wasn't able to download the newest Kindle app and repopulate my library. Long story. Enter Fire Tablet HD 8 just when I needed a new device for the Kindle app and the Prime Day price was unbeatable ...<br/><br/>Buying the tablet was really a no-brainer, and a necessity at the time. I ordered the newest 64G WITH ADS and am ecstatic with that choice. After considerable research in comparing capabilities, the 8 was better than the 8 Plus or the 10" tablet. I don't recommend going lower than 64G even though the 32G is less expensive and memory is expandable. That perk has never worked out well on any device, and we all know that music, movies, and books will gobble up memory faster than a cheetah runs. The white matte finish looks great, but there are things to know before you buy.<br/><br/>** LONG BATTERY LIFE: Surprisingly, I recharge this tablet ONCE EVERY 3 DAYS, despite having it turned on all day with WiFi, and doing alot of Kindle reading.<br/><br/>** SIMPLE OPERATION: After some glitches during setup, and a thorough investigation of the tablet and settings, operation was a snap.<br/><br/>** SETUP ISSUES: I had lots of setup issues due to the endless system updates that were necessary and had to be done in a certain way and order that I couldn't have done on my own even though I'm very savvy with electronics. THERE ARE NO INSTRUCTIONS and it was confusing. That meant being on the phone with tech support to get it all squared away properly. If you're typically Android, this tablet IS NOT ANDROID. IT'S AMAZON. There are similarities, but it's an AMAZON DEVICE THROUGH AND THROUGH.<br/><br/>** SIDEWALK OPTION: Once set up, if you want to opt out of Sidewalk it's very easy within settings.<br/><br/>** ANDROID CONVERTIBLE: For those concerned that it isn't Android and can't download Google Play apps, just go on line for easy instructions on downloading 4 APK files and a launcher in order to turn the tablet into Android and download any apps you want, then create a separate home screen for the Android apps. The current screen is all Amazon apps. Once done, you'll have the best of both worlds combined.<br/><br/>** QUIRKY GLITCHES: I've only had the tablet a few weeks and already there are glitches. The screen occasionally freezes, won't respond to touch, or pages won't open or navigate properly. If you're a heavy reader like I am with an extensive Kindle library and also frequently use Goodreads, there are more glitches. The books that you have "read" do not always synch into your GR account on the tablet. My "friend" count on GR is also incorrect. GR notifications are spotty. It helps that I double check on my phone app and also email, which are both accurate and up to date on GR notifications.<br/><br/>** A BRICK: Heavier than expected. If you're used to Samsung or Apple, this tablet will feel like a brick and also a bit thick. Expected it to be slimmer and lighter in design.<br/><br/>** SCREEN QUALITY: Picture quality not as sharp or good for movies as my Samsung. You'll notice the difference, but it's still good enough.<br/><br/>** DIFFERENCES: Amazon versions of apps are not quite the same as Android versions. Microphone dictation Notes and Highlights on Kindle books sucks. It doesn't understand most words you say, and you need to close and re-open the microphone to repeat. Very cumbersome and ineffective. This feature works flawlessly on Android, but I often have to type notes manually when I get fed up with the wonky microphone. The whole page layout of books in Kindle App is a bit spotty. Noticed a big difference in the way the Tablet Kindle App operates as opposed to Google Play version on an Android device. Sometimes, I get fed up with the issues, and just read for awhile on my phone when I want to do lots of highlights and notes on a book for reviews.<br/><br/>** DON'T BE AFRAID TO GET THE TABLET "WITH ADS"! You'll save $15, and can pay it back later if you want the ads removed. The ONLY time I see ads is when I first turn on the tablet on the opening screen. That's it. See my photo of the book ad. No other ads appear during use or at the bottom of the screen as with my Kindle Reader. It's more of a screen saver that swipes away. As long as you are on the tablet and the screen doesn't go dark, no new or additional ads will appear.<br/><br/>** TOUCH SCREEN RESPONSIVENESS: The screen doesn't always respond. Locks up. Not sure if this will get worse or "it is what it is". NOT an issue that I have with Android.<br/><br/>** DIFFERENT LAYOUTS: Amazon Prime Video not laid out the same as Android. I couldn't even find my Watch List, until I noticed my profile icon and "My Stuff" at bottom of the screen. Why so different Amazon?<br/><br/>** ADJUSTMENT PERIOD: This tablet will take some adjustment, especially if comparing to Android. Although it's geared for Amazon apps, there are more glitches than I prefer, the same as has been happening with all the recent website feature changes on the PC.<br/><br/>It's an okay tablet and perfectly functional especially for Kindle books, music, and Prime Video if you have those subscriptions. 1st 6 months of Washington Post is free. Personally, the tablet needs some improvements and is adequate, but a bit less than expected. It's not the ideal option if you want Android capability, but remember that it is convertible. Because I bought it on Prime Day, I also got a free 3-month, first-time subscription to Disney +, Hulu, and ESPN. I see that offer is still available in another way on Amazon that still might apply to this purchase, so if you're thinking of buying be sure to check the promo with customer service first.<br/><br/>Overall, I'm happy with the tablet, the memory, and the functionality of Amazon World in general which I navigate on a daily basis, but there are some limitations from an android standpoint.<br/><br/>FYI: My photos show the main screen with pre-loaded Amazon apps, an example of a "free ad", and one with the Prime Video screen.</span>

<span>I have the new 7” 2022 fire, the 10” 2021 fire plus, and this 8” 2020 version of the fire lineup. I am a huge fan of the Amazon eco system especially when it comes to the delivery service and their ebook world. I think this is the best thing that has come to happen in technology. I love that these tablets are budget friendly, updated frequently and still can access the google play store. I’m hoping the newer versions remain that way though…<br/><br/>This 2020 8” fire tablet is by far the best one. The 7” has no access to google play and it is a tad slower than this version. The 2021 10” plus I have surprisingly doesn’t function as well as this one. I can’t browse through Amazon, while watching a video without the video pausing or turning off.  For some reason this fire tablet can continue to multitask way better than the one with higher RAM.<br/><br/>I actually had this version in a plum color back in 2020 but I gave it away. But I really wanted a 8 inch again and I chose this over the new one just in case I wouldn’t have access to google play… and I truly love the white aesthetic. I tend to grab this size over any other. I love to read books and find this to be a comfy size for me.</span>

<span>This is actually the second Fire HD 8 I have purchased from Amazon. The first one that I bought a few years ago was for me. It was an 8th generation. This most recent one was a gift for my girlfriend and she has the 10th generation 2020 release. My experience with the original one has been positive. I don't use it as much as I used to but when I do, it still performs well. Battery life is still very good even after 3 years. I was able to add Google Play to it which really made a huge difference in the functionality of it for me. My girlfriend seems to like her brand new Fire HD. Haven't heard any complaints from her yet and she uses it very frequently. Amazon makes a great tablet at a very reasonable price. When it's time to upgrade, I will almost certainly buy another Fire HD.</span>

<span>Spoiler: I ended up returning this.<br/><br/>This is a relatively low-end Android tablet but if you use it only for light things like watching YouTube or browsing the web, you'd think it is much more high-end. The screen quality is very good and seems color accurate. The bezels are relatively thin too. The cameras are so-so (but hey, it is a tablet). The chipset isn't the fastest in the world but the tablet feels much faster and snappier response than the price of the device would suggest. However, beyond the tablet itself is where the problems start.<br/><br/>The soundbar dock is just that - a blue tooth sound bar with a power passthrough. The tablet, even if you leave it connected, regularly disconnects from the sound bar - for me, that was at least once a day. And when the tablet is trying to reconnect to the sound bar, a blue notification screen appears and makes it so that you can't do anything with the tablet until the screen goes away. The sound bar's volume and sound quality are okay - don't expect room-filling surround sound.<br/><br/>Alexa. Oh Alexa. Buying this tablet, I didn't really care if it had Alexa in "show mode" or not. Seemed like an extra bell and whistle (we own an Amazon Echo Show and rarely use it other than an occasional request for a weather forecast or a video chat for the grandkids with their grandma). But oh boy the Alexa implementation is buggy as heck. There are times Alexa doesn't start. There are times it does start and prevents you from actually using the tablet - Alexa sits on the lock screen and to get rid of it to actually get into the tablet's interface you're supposed to swipe the screen but instead you get a variety of Alexa functions by doing so - even if you're swiping up. Other times the Alexa "lock screen" would turn black - no way to access the tablet other than a hard reboot. Finally ended up disabling the Alexa app.</span>

<span>So I got this last year on sale for $140.00 prime day  a great deal I think. Because of the negative reviews pertaining to the smart dock only, I left the dock itself in the box, opting to use the tablet only for the first year. Last week I took it out just to try it and it works perfectly. I signed in, it synced up, and Alexa picked up everything I said to it. It also works as a Bluetooth speaker, which I use for my laptop/monitor home set up and the sound quality is very good. I've used it several times since with no issues. The tablet itself is wonderful. Runs fast, sounds great, and plays android games beautifully. The camera is also crystal clear. Very happy with purchase, no complaints at all it's perfect for me.</span>

<span>Seems like half the people reviewing (give or take) fair well with this product. My dock was broken. The tablet and charging works flawlessly. The dock is broken, and despite any attempts and workarounds, fails to work. I did everything the instructions asked of me, including manually pairing and it doesn't work.<br/><br/>Edit: I will review the tablet after using it more. Thus far, the reason I got this was because it doesn't need to use the USB port to charge. For the past 15 years, every single device I have owned has stopped taking a charge due to the USB port -- for whatever reason. Motorola Adventurer phone, Google (Asus) Nexus 7 tablet, LG G3 phone, G Stylo 3 Plus phone. I'm not sure why these stopped taking a charge. Ever since the Motorola Adventurer crapped out, I had begun to be more intentional about charging cable position, ensuring minimal bend or twist or stress on the charge port. This Lenovo tablet has two gold terminals on the side, which rests on top of the dock. It's foolproof. Minimal component stress involved. Perfect in my book, and that is why I have jacked up the rating back to 4 stars. It would be 5 if it weren't for the dock speaker malfunction. The charge feature works, its just now a big dock lol.</span>

<span>This tablet has pretty decent hardware, but the OS and software that you are forced to use are junk.  First off, the  display is good, the speed is good, the battery life is fair.  It has a usb-c connector for charging and data transfer.  A usb charger is not included, but they do include a usb to usb-c adapter cable that you can plug into your computer.  They include a speaker that can also charge the tablet with an included DC adapter.  More on that later.<br/><br/>I already have a phone with android 9, so I assumed that this would be a breeze.  Wrong.  Turning on the tablet for the first time, it forces you to accept their EULA or they wont let you operate your brand new $100 tablet.  Part of that says that you consent to mandatory updates of system files.  The problem with that is that anytime a manufacturer has a mandatory update like that, its sole purpose is not to fix your bugs or enhance your security, but rather to include internal malware that runs your battery down, slows everything down that used to run fast, or stops your tablet/phone/computer from operating properly.  Samsung and Apple both got caught doing this, but only got a slap on the wrist.  These special updates only come after the warranty expires.  So the first thing I had to do is download a firewall and block all the lenovo upgrade addresses.  There is no other way to disable forced updates.  I will be blocking those addresses on my home router as well.  These are reportedly download.lenovo.com, but blocking *.lenovo.com is probably better.<br/><br/>On the bottom of the screen is a &lt; and a --------------.  The &lt; seems to work like the left pointing triangle on my phone.  On my phone, the square icon pops up a list of running programs.  There is no square icon on the Lenovo tablet.  It doesn't come with a user manual to explain why either.  The long bar icon does random things, but mostly pops up google assistant.  Sometimes it pops up the list of running programs.  And other times it switches either to the main screen or to the previously running program.  Convoluted at best.<br/><br/>If you start a youtube video and then press &lt;, it doesn't stop the video or youtube and they continue to play on the home page.  You can't shut down the app.  On my phone, there is a little X you can hit, but not on the tablet.  if you don't do anything, it will keep running until the battery runs down.  It turns out that you can swipe up from the bottom and sometimes that will give you the running apps.  Other times it will give you the installed apps and other times you get google assistant.  You just have to keep doing it until you get the running apps list.  Once you get those, you can swipe up on them and it will hopefully terminate that app.<br/><br/>Now about those fancy speakers.  They are junk.  They wont work without a prime account.  It literally comes up and says its not going to let you use the speakers without entering your amazon password. Considering these speakers that I paid for come with so much red tape, they will likely go in the trash.  A pair of no-name bluetooth speakers would likely do a lot better without all the drama.<br/><br/>Lenovo if you are reading this, understand that I don't like it when people bully me.  Get rid of those EULA's and mandatory system updates.  And make those bluetooth speakers work unconditionally.  If you treat me like crap, then don't expect me to buy any future products from you.<br/><br/>UPDATE: I did cave and allow it to update to android 10.  The good part is that the super confusing long bar at the bottom is gone and replaced with the standard triangle, circle , square icons.  The bad news is that updating to android 10 broke the voice recognition so that saying "New Paragraph" actually prints "New Paragraph" instead of advancing the cursor to the next paragraph.  Same with "New Line".  I would also say that the battery life is really poor.  I get  about 2 hours of screen time before it has to be recharged.  And that's with battery saver permanently turned on.  It will go about a 2 days just sitting on the table turned off.</span>

<span>I just got this tablet and it’s actually not bad for the purpose of babies I guess but it has really been getting on my nervous about how slow it is. Just simply touching things on the screen are slow moving. Once you actually get to the apps they’re fine, but pressing the touch screen buttons are slow in general. So the purpose of why I got this tablet is for my 19 month old to sit in appointments with me but I think I honestly might return it because of how slow it is</span>

<span>I was very hesitant on ordering a kids fire tablet based on some of the bad reviews… But I don’t agree! Some said the parent access was confusing, which I will agree to an extent but nothing a short yt video my husband watched to find stuff. Pro tip-<br/>You have to add majority app’s from the parent app/profile. It’s easily understandable after you figure that out. It’s LIGHT as a feather, I was expecting much more. And the case feels great. Many app’s for every subject/show/channel you could want. I saw it mentioned that ABC mouse didn’t work but it does on my sons tablet. Most importantly to us, MRS RACHEL! (Well YouTube). I purchased for bf and I feel so far it’s worth the price. Will update if tablet stops working/change of mind.</span>

<span>I bought this for my 3 year old and have had it for a couple of months now.  Overall I really like it but there was a learning curve with the software.  Here are my thoughts and experiences with it.<br/><br/>Pro's:<br/>- Price is excellent if you can catch a sale.<br/>- Case is very good.  Great protection, good quality.  I really like that they put thought into maximizing the sound with the case.  The speakers are on the edge of the device and they make a cool curved area so that the sound from the speakers is redirected towards the user.  Works very well.<br/>- Battery life is really good.<br/>- Curated list of age-appropriate content is very good.<br/>- You can remove content as desired.<br/>- Great warranty.<br/>- As your child grows, the list of content and interface can grow with them.  The main interface is optimized for either readers or non-readers and can be changed if your non-reader learns to read.  The curated content is age-based, so as they age, the content remains appropriate for their age.<br/>- You have control over age range of curated content.  You can set it to whatever you want depending on where your particular child is developmentally.  You can also set the range in terms on age range, too.  Say your kid is 8, you can make just 8 year old content available, or ages 2-8, or 7-10.  Whatever you want.<br/><br/>Con's<br/>- Software could be a lot easier to manage for parents.  Some of the content we wanted to remove.  It's possible but it took me a few internet searches and some fumbling around in the software to find.  I work in technology/software and am pretty savvy and it still wasn't easy.<br/>- No button to show running apps, so you can't directly switch between apps without going to the home screen first.<br/>- Hardware is pretty meh.  It's all pretty basic, lower resolution screen, processor is on the lower end, body material is plastic and feels cheapish.  RAM is ok at 3GB.<br/>- Storage - only offering 32GB is inexcusable.  It allows for very little content to be downloaded/cached on the device and will become a problem at some point for almost everyone.  It should be 64GB as the base and they should offer 128GB as an upgrade.  You're basically required to use an SD card since the 32GB is so small, most people would be fine if it cost a few bucks more and storage wasn't the problem it is now.<br/><br/>Other thoughts:<br/>The software overall is really good in my opinion.  It for sure needs to be more intuitive in regard to management for parents.  However, my daughter has had no issues at all with using it herself.  The interface is perfect for her age.  It also includes some premium content as well through Kindle books and Nickelodeon shows/games.  It's shows and characters she's already interested in, so all that content is fantastic.<br/><br/>Another surprise hit was the experiences available with many of the books, that there are options for the book to be read out loud to your child, or for them to read it, or for a parent to read it for them.  A very thoughtful and useful feature.  My daughter loves having the books narrated for her and is helping in her progress toward learning to read.<br/><br/>Some reviews have mentioned issues with certain apps, including ABC Mouse.  We use that one a lot and have had no issues whatsoever.  I assume that issues other reviewers had in the past have been resolved by software updates.<br/><br/>When you first dive into this ecosystem, it can be a bit overwhelming.  There's a lot of features and settings, as well as content.  After learning how to use and manage it, I can say that I really like it and there's nothing currently on the market that's as good of an end to end experience.  I highly recommend giving it a try and stick with it as you work to understand everything.  Once you've got it figured out, it's pretty easy to manage and great for kids.</span>

<span>Facebook portal is one of the best investment i ever had! It makes it easier for me to call my sister that’s abroad! it’s responsive with alexa and everything was easy to connect! it only has one wire so it doesn’t create that messy look on a floating shelf or table</span>

<span>I bought 2 pieces because I am seperating with family for a while for a job. This is wonderful device for video calling.<br/>1. Great sound quality.<br/>2. Great video quality. Even in low light. And the camera automatically track and zoom in to people. Very smart, put people large in the screen center.<br/>3. Fast speed. Very responsive screen. Which is much better than amazon echo show 8. I purchase 2 pieces of echo show 8. But it was so slow in response and complicated for operating. I had to return them.<br/>4. With build in battery, you don't need to sit in one spot for video calling. You can take the device anywhere you want. Which is another important feature that beats echo show.<br/><br/>Love it. People may blame facebook for privacy issues. But no other company's are doing better.<br/><br/>Highly recommended. I think this is the best video quipment on market.</span>

<span>I can't believe I am saying this because my mistrust of Facebook is as high as anyone else, but the Portal TV is by far the most useful hardware I have ever bought from Facebook. It has struck upon a great idea which is that video calling on your TV when done cheaply is actually a great idea. And it is a very polished implementation of the idea. It's the perfect appliance for calling family members especially the elderly ones.<br/><br/>It's easy to setup. First your family members are already on Facebook or Whatsapp. So that works in their favor. Then setting it up is SUPER easy. It has all the necessary out of box experience thoughtfulness that a device of this class needs to have. Remote is simple, so family members can actually figure this thing out. It really is a lot better than it has any right being. Since I got it, I literally call family members every single day. It's changed my life. I love this thing</span>

<span>I bought this to keep in touch with a family member who lives far away. I found my S20 phone not adequate or comfortable for long calls.<br/>Upon using this it made a huge difference with very good full range speakers and a nice large screen. It gets used for Spotify but apps are few and limited so I don't use it for much else.<br/>Battery life is decent with 5 or so hours of continuous video calling but would predera bit more. Messenger works but I don't see a way to see text messages too like on my phone app.<br/>The downside to this device is buggy software in the wifi. I have tested this unit with different routers and it drops calls sometimes at random whenever signal gets weak. It also does not reconnect to wifi and needs to be rebooted to work again. This is semi random but mostly when signal gets weak or has to hand off in a mesh router setup. I am hopeful that a software update fixes this soon.<br/>If it did better not dropping long calls it would be great. It's still useful to me with limitations in range from routers and offers a great video calling experience much better than phones or tablets.</span>
