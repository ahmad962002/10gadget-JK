<span>I was looking for a camera bag for my wife....nothing large like a full-fledged backpack, but something a bit more compact that can carry an SLR and a lens or two. Or maybe a P&amp;S and a few other items. Unfortunately, it seems like most cross-body camera bags are designed for men, or are cutesy but not necessarily well-made or practical, or scream out "HEY THIS IS A CAMERA BAG!!! EXPENSIVE GEAR IN HERE!!".<br/><br/>When I saw this meliae bag, I was a bit hesitant at first because it looks like it's a relatively new listing. But the price was right, the design was stylish, and based on what I could tell from the pictures and other reviews, the quality was solid. Decided to give it a shot, and so far we're quite pleased with the purchase. It looks and feels exactly like how it's advertised! The build is solid, stitching is great, the clasp is pretty strong. Definitely a great choice.<br/><br/>A few things to note for potential buyers:<br/><br/>1) This is made from GENUINE leather, so in terms of weight, it's not going to be light like bags that are made out of certain synthetic materials or fabric.<br/><br/>2) Pay attention to the dimensions before purchasing. If you're looking for a bag that can store a bunch of lenses + a flash + a water bottle + a huge bunch of keys + sunglasses + etc etc ... this isn't the bag for you. You'll most likely need an XL messenger bag, or even a backpack.</span>

<span>The quality of this bag is topnotch, with features of a high end purse and it does have a very stylish look to it when carrying it.  The compartments are easy to adjust to fit most cameras and a flash or another lens, but not much more than that. The side pocket is too slim and tight to put much more than a phone in it with very little left to put anything else in it.  I did use the zippered portion of the case to put additional memory cards in a case with additional batteries.  The drawback to this bag is that it's much heavier than expected once you have your gear in it and it't very stiff like a suitcase.  I would probably have chosen a much softer sided bag to lessen the weight of the total bag, but it still looked very nice at the wedding I attended.  It isn't quite casual enough to look like anything other than a camera bag which I was trying to avoid.  But overall it's a very nice case for a point and shoot camera or even a DSLR.</span>

<span>This is by far the most beautiful and well made bad I’ve ever purchase. I’ve gotten so many compliments on it. The reason I purchased this bag was because I wanted to have a camera bag that didn’t shout out “I’m a camera bag” I wanted this to be a functional bag where I can actually carry my camera on a daily basis and this absolutely what I wanted. I purchased both colors because I’m obsessed with the tan and the black is just what I wanted as well.</span>

<p> </p>
<blockquote><em><div class="a-row a-spacing-small review-data"><span class="a-size-base review-text review-text-content" data-hook="review-body">
<span>This purse is AMAZING!!! I was skeptical at the beginning when I was considering the purchase because in the picture it doesn’t look big enough but it is! I took it on my latest trip and was able to put in my Cannon EOS Rebel T6 among with my large wallet, phone, keys, gum and other items. It’s stylish, functional, roomy and didn’t feel heavy with all of those items. I truly recommend.</span>

<span>I think this bag had little to no real world testing. The concepts are all great in theory but fail in practice. My issues:<br/><br/>1. The buckle. Twice now I've bumped it the wrong way and my bag has flown off my and slammed to the ground.<br/><br/>2. Comfort. Pack any significant amount of gear and this thing is insanely uncomfortable. The strap digs in and the bag bulges into your side.<br/><br/>3. The dividers. It's insane this bag costs $100 and includes dividers like that. Absolutely useless cheap poorly designed garbage. Probably my biggest gripe.<br/><br/>I think the positives are the amount of pockets and space. But honestly keep shopping. There are bags with better design out there. I have buyers remorse.</span>

<span>The bag is really nice, and exactly what I was looking for in terms of a small bag to fit my camera and an extra lens. The camera is a Sony a6000 with a Sigma 18-50mm DC DN Contemporary lens. The extra lens is a Sony 55-210mm kit lens.<br/><br/>As you can see in my photos, I can also fit 3 extra batteries and some cleaning tools with some room still left over for my phone in the front sleeve and whatever else I need to carry.<br/><br/>My only complaint so far is that I ordered the Glacier Camo design expecting it to be mostly gray, with maybe a hint of blue. However, if you look at the first picture, you can clearly see a hint of green. This green is even more pronounced out in the sun. When I saw this, I had to double check my order to make sure I didn't order the regular camo bag. But as far as I can tell (by the red label on the front), this is supposed to be the Glacier Camo version.</span>

<span>I bought this bag specifically to carry my Canon R5 or R3 w/ 100-500 attached while hiking. I was attracted to it's unique form factor that lends itself to a long hike by not getting in the way or adding too much weight. It makes it easy to carry and access your camera on the trail. Unfortunately, this was not to be in my case. While this bag will barely hold the R5 with 100-500 attached (including hood) , the R3 doesn't fit at all with any lens -- attached or not. If the bag was an inch longer and a couple inches wider maybe. That should give you an idea of the interior space - it's spacious for a small body, but forget about bigger ones.<br/><br/>I did not use this bag -- returned it moments after I recieved it. But here are a few impressions it made on me. That bag desgin itself is excellent. I loved the camo fabric, it would have been perfect for hikes. The fabric is typical ripstop nylon and seems durable. The zippers though are the weak link. I found them "sticky" &amp; stubborn, unable to move fluidly like zippers on Peak Design bags do. That's a problem because when I need to pull my camera out quickly every second counts. That cardinal will just mock me as it flies away. The strap is another sore point. While its adjustable, it's just the "old school" style where you have to pull out slack here and tug there to tighten. That's OK for a discount bag. But premium bags, again like Peak Design should have a quick adjust "friction doubler" strap where it's and easy lift and pull or push.<br/><br/>That gets to the price. $100 is a bit steep for a bag this size with no real premium features. I might have been tempted to keep the bag just to use with the R5 if it was around $65 or even the $100 I paid if it had been slightly bigger and had a decent zipper and strap. Perhaps Hex is comparing this bag to the Chrome Kadet, which is similar in size. But that bag too is overpriced for what it is. That's a $40 bag at best as it has zero padding or structure at all, basically paying for a label. Hopefully we'll see improvements in Hex's next version. If they make these upgrades I'll take another look for sure.</span>

<span>Bought this to replace a similar pack that had ripped in several places after years of use. The first thing I noticed is that I can't fit my Canon 60D with telephoto lens (6" long at it's shortest) in the center of the storage section. I didn't even think about this as it was no problem in my previous pack. The center section of the storage area is about 8" deep, so if your camera body is close to 3" like mine, this could be a factor for you as well. The times when I will take this pack I will have at most 3 lenses so if I remover the telephoto and place it in one of the padded sections it will work out, but I will have to switch or remove the lens before zipping it up. The construction is nice quality, although I prefer to carry with the sling on my right shoulder and this is made for the left. For a lightweight pack it's a great value, these are just a couple things I didn't think about before ordering.</span>

<span>I like that you can carry a SONY camera body and a small lens in the TOP of the BackPack/Sling! you have room for another camera body and two lenses OR 3 lenses ( smaller lenses ) This Backpack is NOT flimsy. I also like the thick protective VELCRO padding that you can arrange any way you like. The sling feature allows you to use it whether you are RIGHT HANDED or LEFT HANDED. Another feature that I like about this BackPack/Sling is that it has "SONY" printed On the TOP zippered compartment and the ALPHA symbol on the bottom front in Orange. I also like that the INTERIOR of the Backpack is ORANGE. Easy to see in Low Light!</span>

<span>I purchased this bag for my new Canon T7 that came with two lenses.  The camera with the 18-55 mm lens fits fine.  However, the Canon 75-300 mm lens that came with my camera barely fits when the camera is in the bag.  I would also prefer to have my tripod legs totally within the bag, not just strapped on  with one leg hanging out.  All in all this seem to be a good quality bag.  I personally should have ordered a bag a bit larger, with more storage.  Once I add my filters, extra batteries, remote shutter release etc. the bag, it is pretty much jammed full. I would like to add a wide angle lens, but that area is taken up by my lens hoods. So I will try to rearrange things, or eventually purchase a larger bag.</span>

<span>Pros:<br/>• Large enough for my new Sony A7 IV plus 5 (FIVE) lenses and room to spare without being too bulky to carry all day<br/>• Easy side access for camera<br/>• Easily accommodates 1" thick, 15" gaming laptop. This plus the camera equipment is such a bonus at this price point<br/>• Top pocket large enough for an extra camera body, cleaning gear, portable storage, etc.<br/>• Handy zip pockets for cleaning cloths, SD cards, extra batteries<br/>• Waist belt!!!<br/>• Handy detached rain/weather cover<br/>• Tripod/water bottle pocket with strap<br/><br/>Cons:<br/>• If you are like me and cursed/blessed with large breasts, as you already know, the sternum strap will probably not work for you. It's not adjustable (up or down on the straps) so it sits pretty much right at boob level (or above boob level if you have extra fiery biscuits). Practically useless. In my case, the strap is attached close to the bottom of the shoulder straps so when I try to use it, it brings the shoulder straps farther up and creates more of a gap between my shoulders and the back of the pack.<br/>• If you have small shoulders, you can tighten the back straps all the way and still have a space between your back and the straps (even without using the sternum strap). As most women know, a pack built around the body of a man will not fit a lot of woman's shoulders. Large boobs + smaller shoulders = awkward fitting pack that needs to be retrofitted in order to be worn comfortably on long days of shooting/hiking.<br/>• I would not recommend carrying a larger tripod with this and probably won't bring my Vanguard Alta. This pack is for smaller, lightweight tripods. That's not a deal-breaker for me. This is a pack that can handle a good amount of lenses, a couple of camera bodies, compact tripod, speedlight and accoutrements without sacrificing portability.<br/><br/>Here's my solution for the straps: Sew the tops of the pack straps together to essentially move the top of the strap down about an inch so it touches the top of my shoulders. I've had to do this with every camera backpack I've owned and this one is no different. The sternum strap can be removed and either resewn higher or you can purchase an adjustable one here on Amazon. Oziral makes a nice one for about $10.<br/><br/>Solid pack for the price. I'll update the review after spending some time with it. I see some people have had quality issues, but at this price point, you can't beat the value here. Would love to give this thing 5 stars, but it would really need adjustable shoulder straps (from the top of the pack) and an adjustable sternum strap (ideally could hook into one of three loops you could sew onto the shoulder straps and could be moved to accommodate different body types). Really like this pack for under $100. 4 stars!</span>

<span>I bought this USA Gear photography backpack a month ago. I wanted to use it for a while before I wrote a review on it so I know how well it works in the real world after it is broken in a little bit. I have been very pleased with it’s performance. The zippers are very easy to zip, the pockets are very accessible, and it fits in well with my life of multitasking. The build quality is good especially for the price I paid for it. I have only owned it for a month, but I plan on having it for a long time.<br/>I am happy with the compartments in the bag. One for lenses and bodies with separators to keep contents secure, and a completely separate compartment for other goods like extra batteries, a book or journal, snacks, your hard drive, or really anything else. It is completely closed off from the part that holds my expensive stuff which I really appreciate. The laptop compartment is perfectly placed and very easy to access. I use a 15 inch laptop and it fits with plenty of room to spare, although I don’t think a 17 inch laptop would fit. The small zipped compartment on the front of the bag is just large enough to hold a couple memory cards and a USB drive which works very well.<br/>I am a relatively new photographer and don’t have as much gear as other photographers that I know, so this smaller compartment for cameras and lenses works well for me. I carry 3-4 lenses in this bag and one body. There isn’t much extra space unless you are willing to have some of the gear move around since there aren’t any extra dividers that come with the bag.<br/>The bag seems to resist moisture pretty well, but in case of emergencies, it does come with a rain cover. It seems easy enough to access, but I have not tried to pack it back into it’s storage compartment.<br/>The bottle holder or tripod holder on the side of the bag seems to work well for small tripods, but not well for most water bottles. I have to clip my water bottle to the tripod holder strap to make sure it doesn’t fall out each time I pick up or put down the bag.<br/><br/>What I do not like is the amount of separators in the camera compartment. I would appreciate more of them so that I could customize the space more. Also, as I buy better gear, I will buy a bag that has more pitch, or is deeper. I have a small crop body now and it fits just fine, but I wouldn’t feel comfortable keeping a Nikon D5 in there. Again, it works just fine for mine and almost every other camera, but I would prefer a deeper compartment.<br/>Another negative is the straps. The bag has straps that buckle around your hips which make long hikes very nice on your shoulders. However, most of the time, I am carrying this bag for no more than 30 minutes and don’t feel the need to buckle those straps. There is no way to detach these and they are very long, so they dangle pretty low.<br/><br/>Overall, I am very pleased with this bag. It has lived up and exceeded my expectations especially for the price I paid for it. It seems to do it’s job just as well or better than comparable bags that are 2-3 times more expensive.</span>

<span>I’m not sure how better it looks in different colors such as brown or olive, but the black one I got was just ok in exterior. Looks aged and antique if to compliment it but the color combined with its square pillar shape makes me look very old-fashioned when carrying it. Black is good for those who like “dad’s camera bag” style. Also looks solidly-made though.<br/><br/>Having said that, the bag is designed compactly and is one of the most efficient and value options for mirrorless camera users. Can contain my Nikon z50 double lens kit (w/o charger), Ricoh GRii and small accessories (flash and mic). Side and front/back pockets are thin and shallow so don’t expect too much of their functionality. Can put thin items such as smartphones, small tablets or card readers (not enough to carry all of them).<br/><br/>I’d suggest to make this big 1-2” bigger in each sides if the company will consider, so there will be some “more than required” rooms to function as an all-round day bag and yet it stays compact in size.</span>

<span>So it’s a very nice bag but honestly I don’t know what cameras they use in the photos I use micro 4 thirds smaller cameras and my 100-400mm takes up a 3rd of the bag very cool features but can be better lay’d out they have 3 camera body’s in that bag and a couple lenses there’s no way I have 2 body’s and 5 lenses and it’s packed also my bag did not come with all those extras so 🤷‍♂️ I don’t know what’s up with that why show it if they don’t come</span>

<span>Took it on several trips and its great. Does get heavy because of how much you can fit in it, had 70-200f2.8, 150-600, 24-105 and 16-35 with canon r. Waist belt does help distribute weight so it definitely helps. Pretty durable so far, happy with it.</span>

<span class="cr-original-review-content">Lo zaino si presenta robusto e molto elegante. Tuttavia la lowepro dovrebbe migliorarlo perché innanzitutto gli spallacci strisciano per terra quando lo si usa come trolley. L’unico modo per evitare ciò è farli uscire dall’alto come fossero due antenne, come nelle foto che ho scattato. Comunque sono riuscito a metterci dentro l’intera serie di fissi Gmaster Sony con due corpi A7s3 con cage smallrig montato. Negli scompartimenti esterni ho inserito due filtri nd con custodia, il cofanetto di 2 pulci saramonic con trasmettitore blink500pro, un registratore zoom h2n e un direzionale sennheiser mke600.<br/>Qualunque altra cosa renderà difficile la chiusura dello zaino.<br/><br/>Consiglio alla lowepro di rendere staccabili gli spallacci nella parte inferiore mediante sistema a sgancio rapido in modo da poterli nascondere completamente quando si usa il trolley.<br/><br/>Per il resto è un buon prodotto, solido e robusto.<br/><br/>Avrei preferito comunque un tessuto già impermeabile senza dover andare infilare la sacca protettiva in caso di pioggia.<br/><br/>Per cavetteria e caricabatterie ho alloggiato una sacca per obiettivi esternamente mediante un paio di fascette. Soluzione comoda anche se avrei preferito evitare di aggiungere pezzi. Ma all’interno non ci entra più nulla quindi era l’unica soluzione possibile.</span><span class="cr-translated-review-content aok-hidden"></span>

<span>I spent a long time filtering between bags. I have a 5D, 40D and XS - I have grips for the 5D and 40D. I also have 5 lenses that I wanted to be able to put in the bag. Everything fits, I don't carry around that much, but I wanted to be able to pack it in if I needed too. For normal carry I throw 6 batteries in the side pocket, remotes in the other side pocket, a couple LED lights in one of the front pockets for some urbex - mount a 17-40 on the 5D and put that in the bag outside of the padded enclosure, put a 70-300 on the 40D and put that lens down into the 4 sectioned padded compartment and put an 85 1.8 in a different compartment. That leaves me with two padded compartments that I can throw in a couple speedlites and pocketwizards if I need, or a bottle of water or something else.<br/><br/>I got the postal strap when I ordered the bag, but the large shoulder strap with the rubber on it would probably hold well enough on it's own. The strap is very long too - I wasn't sure when I ordered if if I could go use it cross body, but there is plenty of room (and I am not small)<br/><br/>The waxwear finish is great and keeps rain out - water beads up and rolls off. I carried it through a couple snow storms and didn't have any problems with anything inside getting wet.<br/><br/>- Update - October 23rd, 2019 - 9 Year update.<br/>Still going strong, gear has changed over the years, bag has remained.  Still good as new, just rewaxed it a few weeks ago getting ready for the winter, looks great still. Postal shoulder strap has some separation, but still holding out.<br/><br/>See if I can update in another 9 years</span>

<span>I bought this bag for our big vacation overseas.  The bag itself is very well made, quite sturdy and well designed.  It has a shoulder strap and shorter hand carry strap.  It has an outside pocket on the back which can be handy if using an iPad mini or for passports, not much else.  It also has the two pockets on the ends with Velcro flaps.  The top cover has Velcro to hold it in place with the additional two snap hook straps for added security.  Inside, two front pouches manage to hold two 77mm filters perfectly.  The bag is waterproof and comes with a can of wax to keep the waterproofness in top readiness.  I found that in warm weather, the wax was rubbing off on my arms and hands.  Maybe with more use it will not be so bad.<br/>I have a Canon 6D with the extra battery grip.  I fashioned the layout of the bag such that I could insert the camera on its side with the lens facing forward.  I can stow the camera this way with either my 35mmL or 24-105mmL lens mounted although it is a bit tight getting into the bag while carrying it on my shoulder.  I can get 4 lenses and my flash in this bag but L lenses are heavy and while this bag could handle the load just fine, I could not carry all that gear for 8 hours a day.  I was soon lightening my load by planning ahead for the day what gear I really needed with me.  I have a camera backpack that can hold all my gear and a monopod but it is not convenient for getting quick access to lenses.  So the shoulder bag does what I need it to do but forces me to better plan ahead my equipment needs for the day.  Functionality is good, I can swap camera lenses with the bag on my shoulder.  The wide cloth shoulder strap was comfortable for carrying this bag all day and adjusts easily.  I wore the bag over one shoulder at times but also found it more comfortable and secure wearing it across my neck.</span>

<span>First off, let me say that while the included shoulder straps are really great, this bag becomes much better by adding the Domke 725-310 FA-031 U.S. Post Office Shoulder Pad.<br/><br/>Now as to the bag itself, it's pretty amazing.  As other reviews have said it holds much more than the relatively small looking exterior would suggest.  I regularly load the bag up with the following:<br/><br/>-Two 1D Series Bodies<br/>-70-200ii<br/>-24-70ii<br/>-100L Macro<br/>-16-28<br/>-35 1.4<br/>-85 1.8<br/>-580ex ii<br/>-Multitool<br/>-An extra battery<br/>-Business cards<br/>-Extra memory cards<br/><br/>That's makes for a very tightly packed 20ish lb bag.  With the extra shoulder pad mentioned above it feels closer to a 15 lb bag which makes a huge difference.  Many users have said that the bag molds to the body and the few times i've loaded the bag up much lighter, I can confirm that this is true.<br/><br/>My only complaint about the bag is that if it was just very slightly bigger it would go from a very good bag to an amazing bag.  With the equipment load listed above, everything fits but it's a rather tight fit and changing equipment out rapidly takes some practice.  Also, there's not really enough room for hoods in the bag, and leaving tripod feet on lenses requires some careful planning about how the bag is arranged.  Finally, any photographer buying this kind of on the go bag is probably going to have some kind of 70-200 2.8, and unfortunately the bag is slightly too short height-wise to really fit one of these lenses, although it will 'fit' if you extend the buckle straps all the way and don't mind a funny looking bulge at the top.<br/><br/>If the bag was just a few millimeters larger in length and width I think that would eliminate the tight fit problems.  The next step up in size, the F-1X is quite a bit larger than the F-2 and seems a bit overkill.  One hope I have is that the bag will stretch out a bit over time and give those extra few millimeters that I'm looking for.  I've already seen this happen with the front pocket where I keep a speedlight.  When I first put in into the pocket I really had to jam it in there, but after a few weeks in the pocket, the fabric seems to relax and really mold itself to the speedlight such that I can easily just drop it in now with now effort.<br/><br/>The last aspect I can comment on is the waxwear finish.  I think it looks fantastic and it really does a nice job of repelling moisture.  There have been some people complaining about the finish coming off onto there clothes and equipment and I can confirm that this does happen to some extent when brand new and when the ambient temperature is high, but I think people are really overblowing how big of an issue it is.  Maybe some bags are worse off than mine but I haven't found it to be an issue at all.</span>

<span>Nicely put together, this bag looks understated and classy, there is more room than the "Little bit smaller" bag which is about the same only without the end pockets. I bought the shoulder pad to go with this bag, which makes it a lot more confortable, the only criticism which I have, is the end pockets cover flap, this is cut away at the top and therefore makes the end pockets susceptible to water/dust ingress, a pocket flap that fully covered the pocket would have been preferrable in my opinion, with maybe the addition of some buttons or clips to make them more secure. On the main bag, fasteners are a good way of making the compartment secure, there is a metal spring clip on each strap which snaps shut once attached, this means that it's very unlikely some light fingered scoudrel is going to access your expensive equipment without your knowledge. The bag material is a waxed cotton affair, similar to my (untrained) eye to the stuff used to make Barbour jackets and their pretenders, if looked after correctly I'm sure it will give good service and last for many years, a tin of wax treatment is provided with the bag, a nice little touch. Before I decided to purchase this bag I looked at many others, from the generic canvas bag to the Billinghams, I really can't vouch for the canvas bags as I wanted something a little nicer for my high-end Nikon gear but baulked at the prices asked for the Billingham bags, hence I settled for the Domke range, all round I think this bag is good and worth the money, looks cool in an understated way, doesn't screan "Mug me, I'm full of expensive gear" and is well made, I'm a happy customer.<br/><br/>R.B. (Happy customer!)</span>
