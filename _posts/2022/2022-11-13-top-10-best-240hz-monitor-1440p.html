<span>I replaced an Alienware 1080p monitor with this Samsung 4K and I am using it primarly for work and it has much clearer text for Word, Excel, and PowerPoint.  Keep in mind that you must use Windows magnification of about 200% because leaving Windows in native 4K creates microscopic text which is unreadable.  So there is some distortion of text at this level of magnification but the trade-off is worth it compared to using a 1080p monitor.  I also tried the monitor with my Xbox Series X and it works as described at 4K and 120hz.  The only monitor that would be better is an OLED panel however they are 1.5x the price of this monitor and the current one from Alienware has a fan which reviewers have stated is an annoyance.  This monitor seems like a great solution until OLED monitors become less expensive and fanless.</span>

<span>I decided to replace my monitor (super wide aspect) with this. I have to say the picture is so much nicer now. Also, with the curved display all of it is in focus without me having to move my head (glasses) around all the time. For gaming I don't know that all the fps and sync are really needed (I'm no twitch gamer) but this display was certainly worth the price. If I had one tiny complaint it would be that after you sleep your computer, if you want to turn off your monitor you have to basically turn it on and wait then select power off. I would have liked a simple click off that wouldn't have cost them much at all to include.<br/><br/>Oh and all the people saying the existing stand is bad - stands are bad in general (physics people). It is actually adjustable up/down (you just push the monitor down). It starts at the highest setting. I already had a monitor swing arm though so after testing it out I installed it on the arm and ditched the stand.<br/><br/>Edit: After using this for a few weeks now I do have one complaint. The monitor seems to take an eternity to wake up when I wake up my computer. It used to be at least twice as fast on my old monitor.</span>

<span>Mine shipped with firmware v1011, the latest as of August 2021. Reviews and information about the monitor suggested that in some instances, earlier firmware may actually perform better in some contexts, so I was a bit nervous about this at first.<br/><br/>Here's the facts.<br/><br/>Yes, the monitor has "scanlines" visible during certain test patterns. You've probably seen the links to lagom or a specific page on ASUS's website. This is an issue with pixel inversion, and to some degree, every LCD based monitor is going to have a test pattern of some kind that will result in a visible, unwelcome change to the displayed picture. This problem doesn't show up in real content. It is completely pointless to be upset about these artifacts, unless a significant sum of your time is spent staring at lagom or that one ASUS page specifically.<br/><br/>What people are talking about much less frequently is that in addition to the "scanlines" you can see in these specific test patterns, there is a lesser "scanline" artifact that can crop up when displaying specific colors, especially larger sections of them. This can become noticeable to an artist that is working on a still image, but is scarcely noticeable in real content. THIS is an artifact of the panel being pushed to the absolute limits of what it's physically capable of. Artifacts like these tend to show themselves when a lot of power is being pushed through the panel - anyone that has used a Valve Index has probably noticed similar "scanlines" in certain situations. Again, hardly noticeable in real content, but I can't say it's entirely invisible like the pixel inversion issue described above.<br/><br/>With adaptive sync and VRR control on, the pixel response time is fantastic across the entire refresh rate range, and there are no visible sudden shifts in gamma, or "screen flashing" when the framerate changes. To those extremely sensitive to judder, it's been stated that this makes VRR "not as smooth feeling" in a way that nobody can seemingly articulate. I _believe_ what is happening here is that a technique is being used to internally double or triple the refresh rate of the input to the highest possible value while staying under 240hz. This can result in a delay if a new frame is ready to be displayed before the doubled or tripled image is finished being scanned out to the panel. In theory, this can have a maximum judder penalty of 4.166~ms (1 second divided by the refresh rate, 240hz), but in practice, we can assume it's going to be an average of half of that, 2.083~, since there's no way to predict if the new frame is ready near the beginning or end of the scanout for the doubled/tripled refresh. I would say that the judder that VRR control can cause is real, but as someone that isn't particularly sensitive to it, it doesn't bother me. It often melts away and becomes imperceptible amongst other performance issues a game may have that result in engine halts that are longer than the average potential judder period with VRR control on.<br/><br/>You can't adjust the pixel overdrive setting with adaptive sync ON and VRR control ON, however, it's tuned well so that low refresh rates appear as smooth as they can, without high levels of overshoot or ghosting. Whether they accomplished this with an actual variable overdrive engine (like you can see as standard on any monitor that has a Gsync module) or through internal conversions of the input refresh to the monitor's maximum refresh, i'm not sure. Looks great either way.<br/><br/>The curve can be weird at times, but disappears in most real content. Notable exceptions to this may be side scrolling or 2d games, where the rigid, straight lines are more easily noticed as being bowed out. I would personally prefer the curve not be there, but it's a small penalty to pay for how good everything else about the monitor is.<br/><br/>Overall: Top tier monitor for gamers (provided you don't care about backlight strobing modes, in which case, the included function for it on this monitor is garbage and shouldn't be used), but if your primary use case is to do professional image editing, or play 2D games, you may find that certain elements of the panel performance and curve are unsuitable or take too long to get used to in order to feel good about the purchase. For everyone else, it's fine and I considered this a definitive upgrade over prior monitors I've purchased (Viewsonic XG2431, Viewsonic XG270, ASUS PG279Q) for non-strobed gameplay. The added contrast of VA matched with a pixel response time performance that is overall faster than today's fastest IPS panels is fantastic to look at.<br/><br/>Model purchased: Samsung 27" G7. Don't forget to filter your reviews to the specific model you're wanting information about so you can get a clearer picture of the exact item you're considering, as the reviews on the store page cover every selectable option, including other sizes or models that use different panels entirely.</span>

<span>This screen's specs can't be beat, except by Samsung's 4K 240Hz Odyssey Neo G8 which really isn't worth it unless you got a PC that can drive something that ridiculous and still have $1500 to blow. What will wow most people about the G7 is the color reproduction and contrast, which due to the VA panel and Samsung's QLED tech is inherently miles ahead of common TN or IPS screens. Since Samsung gives you a pretty solid neutral config out of the box it will look great even without touching the picture settings, but if you look up some test patterns and customize it will be even better.<br/><br/>Another great part that you'll notice more with certain games is of course the fast refresh rate and response time. Use VRR/g-sync for best results and enjoy the seemingly nonexistent ghosting and input lag. This is my favorite thing about the G7 and what I think justifies the somewhat high price tag (which isn't really so bad when on sale). Usually you have to look at tradeoffs between great looking color and these high performance gaming specs, but the G7 feels like a no-compromises solution for most users who aren't doing some kind of color-sensitive professional work or playing FPS games at a pro level (in which case I would think such a big screen wouldn't be practical anyway).<br/><br/>There are a few issues with this G7 that I've run into. The most obvious is inversion artifacts in some situations, most easily triggered by test patterns and certain combinations of browser and website dark modes. It has not been a dealbreaker for me because artifacts have not appeared with "real" content aside from websites, and you can be sure I was squinting at every moving object in games for the first couple of weeks. The pattern is sensitive to the Black Equalizer setting, so it may be worth experimenting with if you're not too bothered by inversion but want to minimize it.<br/><br/>Next problem is that in the out of the box configuration, using VRR/g-sync will result in scanline-like artifacts and flickering while in-game. This is fixed by enabling "VRR Control" which is hidden at the bottom of the second page of system settings. You have to be on the latest firmware to have this so make sure to check the Samsung website and confirm you've got the latest. VRR control ought to be on by default to avoid the issue but it isn't. While you're in the menu, turn off "Dynamic Contrast", a feature that seems to just make the picture look worse.<br/><br/>PS5 support is fine, it takes 4K input and downscales it which is great news until the PS5 gets 2K support. But the monitor's HDMI port is version 2.0 so you are limited to 4K@60hz (with or without HDR) due to HDMI 2.0 bandwidth. Theoretically 2K@120Hz without HDR should be possible but I have not been able to try the PS5 beta firmware and confirm.<br/><br/>HDR: It's pretty new to me, so I don't know where to set expectations. First thing I did in HDR was Ghost of Tsushima and I found it kind of underwhelming. I think the game was made to look amazing with or without HDR, so going from a good VA panel without HDR to one with HDR didn't blow me away. The effect was more noticeable in movies. I watched "The Night House", a recent horror movie that was released in HDR, and the first four "Star Trek" films which were remastered in HDR. For "Night House", it was really nice and the contrast between bright and dark scenes made it feel more like watching in the cinema. In the "Star Trek" movies, the extra brightness in space battles was welcome. There was a scene in "The Wrath of Khan" that seemed to confuse the local dimming algorithm, resulting in noticeably brighter/darker rectangles crawling across the screen behind the Enterprise. This may be a limitation of HDR on an edge-lit screen. Overall, nice to have but not a game changer at least in this implementation.<br/><br/>Some words about the non-screen bits. I have it mounted to a monitor arm, which works great, the necessary VESA bracket is included. I am happy to report that the power LED (which you can set to be off when the screen is on) is not very bright. I'm sick of my living room glowing blue at night so I appreciate Samsung not adding to the problem here. Headphone users will appreciate the headphone jack for your HDMI and DP audio, which I use a lot because my motherboard has a noisy headphone jack. A remote for volume control would be nice, but sadly it's not available. Whether or not you get software volume control may depend on your GPU and operating system: my PC with a 3080 does have one, but my Mac does not, and I have not been able to get DisplayBuddy working. Consoles do not have software volume control on the HDMI output. The included stand has a headphone holder on the back, which seems like a weird choice for such a big monitor. Some of Samsung's earlier gaming monitors had a headphone holder that pops out of the side, which would have been better but I suppose more difficult to implement on a curved screen.<br/><br/>Something I have found surprisingly annoying is switching between inputs. My setup looks like this: DisplayPort1 is connected a gaming PC, DisplayPort2 to a Mac, and HDMI to a device for toggling between my PS5 and Nintendo Switch. The only scenario that works well is switching between one of the DP inputs and HDMI when both inputs are on. Any other scenario, changing inputs is going to take 20+ seconds for everything to settle and the monitor might become unresponsive until you unplug and reconnect the DisplayPort input you want. No other monitor I've used has been this annoying.<br/><br/>Overall: For me this looks like it will be the perfect main display for several years, or more if higher resolutions take a while to take off. Do your research and be aware of the issues before deciding to buy based on the specs alone.</span>

<span>Was tired of frame capping every game with a 3080, decided to buy this and I definitely notice a diff from 144hz. Colors are great out of box, less ips glow than my other monitors. Stand is substantial and heavy. Didnt really mess with anything in the OSD because didnt feel the need to change response time etc. Provided dp cable supports 240hz and thankfully is decent length.

<span>Buying a monitor is always a gamble and something I find to be stressful. Thankfully the XG271QG arrived with no backlight bleed, no IPS glow and no dead pixels. It really is an excellent monitor. The issue I have with the monitor is the anti-glare coating.<br/><br/>The monitor always looks like the pixels are shifting – making text look fuzzy and images look like they are shifting. After doing some research, it turns out it may be an issue with the specific anti-glare coating used on the screen – something that most users will not have a problem with.<br/><br/>Sadly, I will be sending the monitor back because no matter what settings are changed, still images and text look like they are moving.</span>

<span>The package travelled well.<br/><br/>Monitor is of an exceptional quality. No light bleed, no dead pixels. The only problem I had which seemed to have been fixed after I fiddled with the drivers is the OSD menu... After I installed the drivers from their website, the OSD menu had graphical corruptions that would render the menu impossible to read. After uninstalling the drivers and reinstalling them, I have managed to fix it. I should've taken a picture so that I can show what the problem was but alas I haven't. The swivle arm is absolutely amazing. You can set it as you wish and need. Honestly I can't really fault the monitor (apart from the speakers but I wasn't expecting anything from them anyway so not a real problem for me). The only real problem was the OSD but thank goodness it is solved now.<br/><br/>Picture quality: great<br/>Brightness peak: enough for a lit room</span>

<span>I've owned this monitor since July.<br/><br/>This monitor is great for work and play. I work from home as a graphic designer so good colors do matter to me. This is not the best monitor on the market for color but it def gets the job done.<br/><br/>Major selling point for me was the USB-C port as I wanted to use that connection to my MacBook pro. Works flawlessly.<br/><br/>The "joystick" for the menu is very easy to use and is fast to switch inputs as I switch back and forth from my personal computer and macbook for work. Super easy. My Acer Predator input swapping is trash compared to this.<br/><br/>---Only negative---<br/>The only thing is that the HDR may not really be usable and I believe it's because of the brightness levels. So if one of your big things is to experience HDR, get something with a higher HDR rating.<br/><br/>I received no dead pixels and have had no issues. Def would recommend.</span>

<span>I've gotten 2 of these monitors, one as a replacement I had to purchase before I could send it back..<br/>First I will say the picture quality is almost perfect. There's very little blue, the colors are super nice, and the picture is super crisp.<br/><br/>Now the bad: the first one I received has awful backlight bleed. Like so bad it's really noticeable walking around in a dark game. It also had dead pixels.<br/><br/>The replacement I have doesn't have dead pixels, but the backlight bleed is so much worse its unbelievable. During most circumstances I can see the backlight bleeding around a quarter of the edges of the screen.<br/><br/>If you can get a good one in sure this monitor is solid, but with the 2 I have received in immensely disappointed. Why buy this and risk shoddy qc, when I can buy a Samsung and risk the same amount of bad qc for slightly more, and get a larger, arguably better monitor, with better response times and deeper blacks?<br/><br/>Meh/10</span>

<span>I have some mixed thoughts of this monitor, but since there is no perfect monitor out there, ill keep it for the long haul.<br/>------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>The problems I've ran into already:<br/><br/>-1 dead pixel on the middle-right side of the screen. I purchased a 4-year warranty so until this gets worse, I won't send it back because it really is hardly noticeable, even in solid color or black/white backgrounds.<br/><br/>-Why did MSI release this monitor without any proper and optimized support for their on screen display app?<br/><br/>-The "easy button" on the bottom left of the monitor is useless as the on screen display app MSI has isn't even supported for this brand new monitor, so when you press the button to open the application to quickly modify monitor settings, nothing happens.<br/><br/>-No RGB adjustments found or available at this time.<br/><br/>-No real step by step instructions to set this monitor up.<br/><br/>-It also came with wall mount screws and no wall mount bracket, why?<br/><br/>-This is an IPS display, so backlight bleed is literally guaranteed in some extent when viewing bright displays in a dark room. Truthfully, the backlight bleed on this monitor is pretty minimal overall.. When turning the background to all black background the bleed is minimal to moderate at its worst, but when viewing colors in the display, videos, playing games in a dark environment--there is virtually no backlight bleed except for maybe in still-screen-load screens, etc.<br/><br/>I think I'm more annoyed that MSI released this monitor and forgot to finish a few odds and ends. Seems like they rushed it out the door for something to work decent with windows 11 / 12-gen intel processors.<br/>------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>Scoring:<br/><br/>5/5 for gaming in this "gaming era" with the specific technology out- 240hz at 1440, or 240hz at 1080p downscaled. And you know the rest from the details provided by MSI. The monitor for gaming for the price is pretty amazing.<br/><br/>4/5 for picture quality- the picture is not perfect, therefore does not deserve a 5/5. It is great, but it could be better. The lack of support for the on-screen display app to customize settings easily also contributed to this score.<br/><br/>3/5 for having a dead pixel and some backlight bleed in certain viewing angles.<br/><br/>With all that being said, I would still highly recommend this 1440p monitor over others on the market for gaming. Despite the areas of concern above, it is that much better in areas where this monitor shines.</span>

<span>A week after I built my new gaming pc I accidentally cracked the screen on my Asus Rog Swift PG279Q , the 2015 model of this line. Made the mistake to cheap out and replace it with another monitor for less than half the cost of this one, won’t say which one but it only took a day to realize you get what you pay for. Returned it and paid the price to go with the upgraded version of what I had and am very pleased. The cheaper monitor didn’t have a dedicated G-Sync module as my 2015 model had as well and it definitely makes a big difference from a software induced g-sync compatible IMO. The variable refresh rate of a true native G-Sync monitor is buttery smooth and this monitor is that and more. The out of the box colors are nice , however with a little tweaking it’s even better. I used the Icc profile from rtings.com , a few adjustments in the Nvidia control panel.<br/>Forgot to mention my unit had Zero backlight bleed/IPS Glow or dead or stuck pixels. Also the text clarity is superb compared to the cheaper aforementioned bad buy.<br/>Worth Every Penny!</span>

<span>I'll start by comparing this to the close second I almost ended up with:<br/><br/>I was stuck between this and the Samsung Odyssey G7. Basically a high quality VA vs a high quality IPS. What the G7 has that the PG329Q doesn't is 240hz, and better contrast, plus the curve if your into that. I ended up not going with a high end VA because of the QC issues Samsung has been having, plus the fact they only warranty their product for 1 year, vs Asus who has a 3 year (which includes a warranty of less than 3+ bright dots and 5+ for black dots, which I think is decent), along with the black smearing concerns and poor viewing angles. Samsung has mitigated the black smearing to some extent (its better than almost any other monitor with a VA panel on the market), but it is still present at 240hz. To eliminate the black smearing entirely on their G7, you must reduce the refresh rate to 165hz, which kind of defeats the selling point of that monitor. (There or more reviews online if you want to learn more about the specific pixel response times of the G7). I've tried VA and IPS panels before, and I consider black smearing to be really unpleasant, that specific thing ended up being more important to me than better contrast.<br/><br/>About the PG329Q, my unit came great out of the box and I couldn't find any dead pixels. Setup was easy and straightforward:<br/><br/>REFRESH RATE: 9/10. The refresh rate of 165hz (oc'd to 175 in the OSD), at this price point is great. It won't get up there in the 240 hz range with its TN and VA counterparts, but it provides a great experience overall. (There is a 240hz version of this monitor that will be released next year, though I am unsure of the penalties this will result in picture quality, price, etc...)<br/><br/>PIXEL RESPONSE: 9/10. I settled on the 4/5 overdrive setting in the OSD. 5/5 resulted in overshoot and artifacts, and feels like that is only there so they can claim the 1ms response time. I do not have special tools to measure the response time, and am basing my opinion based off of my own experience in games and the UFO test. At 4/5 the transitions look very good, and I couldn't notice any significant overshoot.<br/><br/>ELMB w/ sync: 10/10. What Asus has done here is incredible with their ELMB (with gsync!). Double imaging was only present on very quick movements on the desktop, and it is so subtle I leave it on, even while I'm not gaming. The brightness was still very good for me with it on, as it does decrease brightness by maybe 25-35%. The benefits in game took me by surprise, it really does look quite good. It makes a 80 FPS experience feel like a 160 FPS experience.<br/><br/>COLORS: 9/10. Absolutely fantastic colors, and the monitor comes pre calibrated from the factory. They even provide the calibration profile and the color space it covers. I am no professional, but I was very pleased with it. I was disappointed it doesn't do true 10 bit. It does 8 bit color with +2 provided with GPU dithering. But the colors provided to the end user are great for a layman such as myself.<br/><br/>CONTRAST: 7/10. It feels good for an IPS, not at VA levels of contrast however, and the blacks do feel a bit grey at times in dark scenes. So as I said before, good for an IPS panel, but its nothing to write home about.<br/><br/>IPS GLOW/BACKLIGHT BLEED: 10/10. For my unit it was great. I had no issues with bleed, and the IPS glow is low.<br/><br/>VIEWING ANGLES: 8/10. Good viewing angles, but at about 35-45 degrees they begin looking a little washed out.<br/><br/>ERGONOMICS: 8/10. Height, tilt and swivel work great. I was disappointed it didn't come with rotation as well.<br/><br/>HDR: 6.5/10. This isn't going to impress any HDR junkies out there but its nice to have. The peak brightness (for flashes and explosions was bright enough to make me flinch) was really great, but being edge lit it isn't going to give an OLED HDR experience, so go into it understanding that. It's a nice perk, and did surprise me with it's capabilities, though limited.<br/><br/>INPUT LAG: 10/10. From my love of playing twitch games, I can say that from the seat it felt incredibly responsive. No complaints here.<br/><br/>CONNECTIVITY: 8/10. Only complaint is that the DisplayPort is 1.2a+ and not 1.4. Not a huge deal as it doesn't really need more than that, but it's worth mentioning.<br/><br/>Given its price point, advertised performance and specs, I am really happy with it overall and plan on keeping it as my main monitor. 5/5 stars. The unboxing experience and materials provided were great, and the monitor and stand itself feels extremely solid. The "gamer" aesthetic on the back may be polarizing for some but it's on the back so I don't really mind.</span>

<li><span class="a-list-item"> A 240Hz refresh rate is 4x faster than typical standard monitors and twice as fast as common 120Hz gaming monitors. More frames means smaller visual information Gaps, which means a faster reaction time for the Gamer. There's a 8.3 millisecond gap between frames at 120Hz, which is halved to 4.16ms between frames at 240Hz. This is incredibly important to gamers playing at breakneck speeds, and provides an edge over gamers less well-equipped. Combined with skill, get more wins by being able to react in real-time.  </span></li>
<li><span class="a-list-item"> Amd Radeon free Sync technology synchronizes the GPU and monitor, displaying full frames only when the monitor is capable of displaying them. This minimizes graphic distortions such as tearing and artifacts from forming on screen, allowing you to experience native refresh rates up to 240Hz for rapid-fire, tear-free Graphics that don't require user adjustments.  </span></li>
<li><span class="a-list-item"> A wide-angle viewing range means that color coverage is consistent no matter which angle The screen is viewed from. This is thanks to the IPS technology that the monitor is built on.  </span></li>
<li><span class="a-list-item"> Convenient monitor controls are easily reached on the right side of the monitor, with a new joystick for navigating menus quickly and intuitively. The individual buttons can be assigned as shortcuts for the gamer's preferred tools and settings.  </span></li>
<li><span class="a-list-item"> The true 1ms response time blasts away motion blur. The pixels are able to change quickly and respond to the new image signal as it comes in. This is a new feature for IPS monitors, which have typically been considered too slow for gaming.  </span></li>

<span>I can't really say there is anything I don't like about these monitors.  Had these for over a year now and never had a problem with them.  Well built, highest quality and they look awesome.  The only lag is the internet connection (come on spectrum, keep up).  Every connection from display to USB has been well thought out  These are so easy to install and when done, looks clean!  Love the ability to adjust everything from height to color of illumination.  Super happy with the purchase of these!</span>

<span>The monitor was delivered very quickly which is nice. The solid packaging prevented any damages to the screen or parts (stand/base). Alienware/Dell make quality products and I hope this AW2521HF lasts for some considerable time (might be cheap for some folk but with international shipping to beautiful Fiji, I paid a total of about FJ$1,300.00) but to complete my machine (have an R11 - was using an AOC 27" 144Hz GSync, also very crisp) price was, on balance, negligible (we live once...at least with current sci/tech). So far I am pleased to say no dead pixels or backlight bleed issues (not paranoid but I first read negative comments/reviews before buying any tech online for obvious reasons - I live in Fiji - shipping costs, even for "free returns/replacements" are not negligible). Played a bit of Deus Ex (alas not the new ones with Jensen, the old classic with JC, the revision version) and also Doom Eternal and while I honestly cannot tell the difference between 144Hz and 240Hz (doubt i'll appreciate a 360Hz) the gaming experience (maybe a placebo) seemed snappier/fresher and overall smooth. Not that I have any complaints with AOC, but Alienware is Alienware. Thank you Amazon for being a facilitator and thank you DHL for the speedy and safe delivery. Also, thank you Alienware/Dell for your quality products. Hope this lasts (we're all very climate/environment conscious now) so I'd rather use quality tech like Alienware for some time to come (until the next tech leaps).

<span>My last monitor I purchased was in 2007, and when I rebuilt my system I bought all new to include this monitor.<br/><br/>At first I bout a 27 inch monitor from a walk in store, because it was the only one the store had.  I never thought there would be a shortage of monitors.  Then after I bought it, realized it was notGysnc since I have an NVidia card.  The 27 inch was way to big anyway.  Way to big to use for desktop gaming.  It was 4k and actually really nice though.<br/><br/>I returned it and spent  a few days scouring reviews, what kind, what size, and it was an endless task.<br/>I play pc games, and as one site mentioned anything bigger than 25 inches was too much to play desk top gaming.  I don't do xbox.<br/><br/>They were right, and although this measures actually 24.5 roughly, call it a 25 inch monitor.  I am so glad I didn't buy anything bigger.  Your field of view can't cover it all.<br/><br/>Color is great, solid, and no need for me to adjust it.  A very solid base, nothing flimsy about and I love that I can turn off the back lights, that everything seems to have, mice, modems, keyboards, and now monitors.  Enough with all that.  The box and packing was unlike anything I had every seen, a quality job, and very nicely done.<br/><br/>The only thing I jibber about is the cost.  A bit high, but if it lasts me as long as my 20x20 square NEC monitor did, it is money well spent.  I am not into labels or names, but I appreciate that Alienware didn't go all kid like on displaying it.  It's a good display without marketing for young kids, but shows it in a classy way.<br/><br/>Cables hide well with a built in organizer and the adjustment of raising and lowering is nice too.  I think it is very solid, the exact size for desktop gaming and colors have been very nice and clear.  I am glad I bought this.  I am surprised how hard 24-25 monitors are to find.  This came with appropriate cables too, unlike some vendors, you have to go buy the optional cables.  Packing is some of the best I have ever seen.<br/><br/>I wanted to give this 4 stars, taking one off for price, but considering I really like this, cost wasn't so much a factor to take a star off, unless someone can tell me there is a generic version of this for much less money.</span>

<span>PREVIOUS MONITOR<br/><br/>Since 2016 I've used the Acer XB271HU 1440p, 165Hz, IPS, G-SYNC Module, 27" monitor for everything I did. That includes gaming, 3D modeling (Rhino3D, Maya, ZBrush), 3D rendering (Maxwell, VRay), photo editing (Photoshop, Lightroom), 2D graphics (Illustrator), and it did great for everything. I never calibrated it and colors were still decently good (not perfect) when printing physical copies of my work. For gaming, it was great and I could not have chosen a better monitor when I did for the various things I needed it for.<br/><br/>NEW MONITOR (ASUS XG27AQM)<br/><br/>To preface this, I've also used the Acer XB273U GX and the ASUS TUF VG259QM for several months each and at separate times each. Purchased them at Micro Center just for testing purposes (to see which I liked more) and not for ownership. I know some people prefer 24" monitors for gaming, but I personally can switch between 24" and 27" monitors just fine.<br/><br/>It's only been one day since I received ASUS XG27AQM in the mail, but listed below are my PROS and CONS. Personally, it's worth the upgrade from my previous monitor (especially since I'll be looking to sell my XB271HU now). The ability to feel and play at frames higher than 165fps (especially if sustained and with a crisp frame time graph) is very noticeable and makes fast paced games much more enjoyable. I have not overclocked it to 270Hz because there's currently really no need to in my opinion (refer to CONS).<br/><br/>SIDE NOTE (UPDATED)<br/><br/>I'm also a bit cautious of the OC function because on my previous experience with the Acer XB273U GX and the ASUS TUF VG259QM. Both screens would go black for a few seconds and then the picture would come back. Granted, it also warns you when enabling the OC. I honestly didn't mind it, but it'd happen in the middle of a game which was annoying at times. I purchased an iVANKY DP1.4 cable (since the reviews were great) and the black screen still happened even when trying different ports on the monitors and graphics card. The OC function on my Acer XB271HU never caused the screen the go black, ever. Update: Since writing the review, I've overclocked the XG27AQM to 270Hz, and at least for my unit, the screen does not flicker or go black for a few seconds. Keeping it overclocked for the foreseeable future.<br/><br/>PROS<br/>- 1440p<br/>- 240Hz (270Hz OC)<br/>- Very Responsive (Slightly quicker input lag than my previous monitor, but that's probably due to the increase Hz)<br/>- Good colors (Will most certainly calibrate this monitor though)<br/>- Arrived with zero dead pixels<br/>- No perceptible overshoot at Overdrive Setting 4 (I tried OD-5 as well, but I visually preferred OD-4)<br/>- Motion clarity at OD-4 with ELMB disabled is noticeably improved from my previous monitor<br/>- I have G-SYNC Compatible enabled and it works great (I personally don't notice a difference from a physical G-SYNC Module, and many well documented reviews for monitors only show an input lag increase of &lt;1ms when enabling a Variable Refresh Rate technology) so it's worth it<br/><br/>CONS<br/>- When enabling ELMB, the brightness is too low for me even in a very dark room. Update: I've since enabled ELMB. What I did to combat the brightness drop is set it to 100% brightness first, then enabled ELMB, and finally set Shadow Boost to Level 2. It was plenty usable after that.<br/>- I don't have an RTX 3080 yet to push more frames haha :'( My RTX 2070 Super is great, but an upgrade is definitely needed for this type of monitor. Maybe I'll wait for an RTX 4080 to pair with my i9-10850K @ 5.0GHz.<br/><br/>FINAL THOUGHTS<br/><br/>If you haven't purchased a monitor in several years and have been looking for a proper upgrade, here is your monitor, the ASUS XG27AQM. These specs will not become obsolete any time soon. The 1440p resolution provides improved visual clarity from 1080p, the increased refresh rate of 240Hz Native/270Hz OC from 165Hz is noticeable, and the motion clarity improvement is great for the enjoyment of fast paced video games.<br/><br/>If I were asked, "Would you return your ASUS XG27AQM and instead purchase the Acer XB273U GX or ASUS TUF VG259QM?", my answer would be, "No."<br/><br/>But if I were asked, "In hindsight, which would you purchase, the ASUS XG27AQM, Acer XB273U GX or ASUS TUF VG259QM?", my answer would be, "The ASUS TUF VG259QM is 100% out of the question because of the noticeable decrease in resolution and visual clarity. For the ASUS XG27AQM and Acer XB273U GX it would depend on availability. Both 1440p 270Hz monitors are great each with their own pros and cons. The Acer XB273U GX has two usable Black Frame Insertion modes (Off, Normal, and Extreme) vs the ASUS XG27AQM's (On and Off). Colors, motion clarity, and input lag are all comparable. Ultimately, I'd be hard pressed to say one is better than the other, so I'd be happy purchasing either the ASUS XG27AQM or the Acer XB273U GX. But from my own personal experience, there was some noticeable overshoot on my copy of the Acer XB273U GX which is why I did not repurchase it and instead went for the ASUS XG27AQM. No overshoot to be seen on my copy of the ASUS XG27AQM which is why I will be keeping this monitor and not returning it."<br/><br/>Games I Play: Witcher 3, PUBG, Rocket League, Battlefield (4, V, 2042), Apex Legends, Risk of Rain 2, Dragon Quest XI, Ori Series, Trine Series, and Resident Evil 2 Remake.</span>

<span>Few bullet points regarding the advertised features:<br/>270hz:<br/>-Had a few times where the monitor flickered, but I think it was due to the DisplayPort cable being an issue.  I'm also using a dual monitor setup, this one and another with actual GSYNC module (PG27UQ). If I enabled Adaptive Sync on this monitor before turning on GSYNC in Nvidia's control panel, this monitor sometimes went completely black and wouldn't turn on unless I restarted the PC. But again, it's possible this could be related to my dual monitor setup. So what I do from now on is just enable GSYNC in the Nvidia Control panel first, then enable Adaptive Sync on my monitor.<br/><br/>Monitor design:<br/>-I really wished ASUS changed the design of the monitor ports for these monitors so the cables weren't so bent going in. It goes up vertically and if your displayport is too bulky, the wires will get really bent going in. I've had to purchase separate ones, ones labeled "DisplayPort 1.4" from Maxonar Store on Amazon.<br/>-Flickering @ 270hz stopped when I got the DisplayPort 1.4 cable. This is a different sort of screen-black-out that occurred without Adaptive sync turned on. Keep in mind there is a disclaimer when turning on 270hz that screen-flickering may occur. But so far, I've used it for 2 months now and havent had it happen after the week.<br/><br/>ELMB Sync<br/>-I don't use ELMB/GSYNC for competitive games, but I can confirm it does work fine. '<br/>Just keep in mind that the following occurs when ELMB Sync is enabled:<br/>-HDR can not be enabled<br/>-Screen brightness is also dimmed as a result<br/>-Overdrive setting is locked out when ONLY when ELMB Sync is enabled.. In other words, Adaptive Sync On + ELMB Sync off = Overdrive is unlocked. Adaptive Sync + ELMB Sync on = Overdrive is locked and cannot change.<br/><br/>You can technically also use only ELMB by turning on ELMB Sync on + Adaptive Sync Off. This is only advisable if the game is running at fixed FPS (120hz = game is constnatly 120fps, or 240hz = 240fps) If the game's FPS fluctuates during this mode, you'll experience double-images/artifacting.<br/><br/>Personally, I haven't noticed any flickering/eye-strain with ELMB Sync, but as with strobe-based motion blur reduction, some people may be sensitive to it. ELMB sync will turn off by itself if it reaches below 80fps, FYI. It will turn back on once it goes back up. Someone also mentioned increasing brightness before turning on ELMB but it didn't make a difference to me. The only thing you can change is Contrast and Shadow Boost levels with it on.<br/><br/>-I've used NVIDIA filters to increase the brightness to compensate, but again, I really only bought this to play competitive games at a high refresh rate. I switch to my PG27UQ 4K monitor for proper GSYNC/visual fidelity<br/><br/>HDR400:<br/>-In comparison to my PG27UQ HDR1000 certificiation, my PG27UQ blows it out of the water obviously.<br/>If this is your first HDR monitor, you'll still be impressed by the visuals in games that do support it. Just keep HDR disabled in Windows until you're ready to play a game.<br/><br/>-Windows 11 is also going to be changing how HDR looks when it's enabled by default so that it doesn't look washed out when you're not playing a game or not playing an HDR-capable video<br/><br/>TL;DR:<br/>+Buy it for competitive games, especially if you want ELMB. Buy it if your card can achieve 240fps+<br/><br/>-Don't buy this if you're looking for GSYNC compatible features. Most would argue native GSYNC monitors, while expensive, are worth it if you're a stickler for it. Otherwise, know that you are getting something that is "good" but not as good as actual GSYNC.<br/><br/>-For GSYNC Enthusiasts, look up PG279QM for an actual 1440p 240hz (not 270hz) GSYNC monitor with similar features). Keep in mind, the PG279QM does NOT have ULMB despite having a native GSYNC module. But most reviews seem to praise it despite it and looks good without it.<br/><br/>-Dont buy this for the HDR400. The lowest I recommend is HDR600 for any noticeable difference. It's still better than nothing, but if you can afford to buy something better, then buy something better.</span>

<span>I needed to replace my 5 year old 28" 4K monitors but didn't want to spend a fortune on a dual curved screen setup.  I picked these up for $249.99 each on sale.  Holy crap are these an improvement.  I use them for work (writing SQL, reading articles, writing 20-40 page teardown articles).  There are some reports of text legibility being low, but I have absolutely no issues.  Best mode is "Racing Mode", the rest are useless.  Bring completely forthcoming, there was the slightest difference that was driving me crazy while having them both in "Normal" color mode.  With a little tweaking, they match up just fine.</span>

<span> Best gaming monitor for gaming and low input lag.I have tried it on my ps5 and it’ does support 120hz on 4K and 1440p. However, for HDR gaming when it comes to dimming features it’s not that good if you are looking to play game with full hdr experience but if there no black screen won’t even notice that.</span>

<span>Works perfect with my pc and ps5. The ppi is 92 which looks just fine I promise if you’re reading this and worried about 1440p 32inch don’t be. It’s a beautiful monitor and the controls are great. In fullscreen modes in games it does set my screen to 4k but just switch the game to borderless and it fixes it. Long story short I was nervous but pulled the trigger while it was 599 and I couldn’t be happier. Great next gen features, just hook a soundbar up with an aux and get to gaming you won’t regret it!!</span>

<span> I am changing my 5 star review to 2 stars why? look at the new pictures I posted, ON PC when playing fullscreen mode it is stuck to 120 hz, While in borderless mode it is 240 hz, This monitor thinks I'm playing 4k 120 hz when this is clearly a 240 hz 1440p monitor. Apparently Fullscreen 240 hz works when having adaptive sync on extended. This should not happen on a very expensive monitor. Everything else is amazing on this monitor from colors to quality and VRR, but this tech flaw makes games play weird, In certain games lie Apex I'm getting double imaging, I thought I was getting 300 hz according to in game steam fps, but it was actually 120 hz. I will change my review once this has been fixed and acknowledged.<br/><br/>Again it is 240 hz on borderless mode, and 120 hz on fullscreen mode. This is not the LG32gq950-b it is the 850 version, so when switching to 4k it looks blurry. Why does it even have this option on PC in the nvidia control panel. This also messes with games scaling because it thinks I have a 4k monitor.</span>
