<div class="slideshow-container">
<blockquote><em><div class="a-row a-spacing-small review-data"><span class="a-size-base review-text review-text-content" data-hook="review-body">
<span>One drawback is when it comes to PC's and Monitors, you won't know for sure until you try it out for yourself. You can ask the seller questions, but sometimes the question you should have asked isn't obvious until the thing is sitting on your desk. It may boil down to something very specific to your application/environment/ergonomics that the seller, or even the manufacturer can't give you a definitive answer because of the subjective nature of sitting in front of a screen for hours at a time.<br/>  A big help for me in determining which to order is to download the user manual and quick set-up guides from the Manufacturer Website. By carefully reading the specs and going through the OSD Menu entries I am sure that what I'm ordering, at least on paper, has the right specs. This way, the monitors should have all the right comparable specs and you should end up with what you really want. Still, as was it was in my case you may have to try it out before you can finalize the purchase.<br/>  I need a widescreen curved monitor such as this 30" Scepter with PBP (split screen) so as to be able to work on documents from two different inputs, i.e. two PC's. So I am reviewing this from more of a business angle, not from a Gaming criteria.<br/>  Basically, it is a simple, single-purpose gaming PC Monitor. If used just for gaming on an Nvidia Graphics PC, it works as advertised. You've got to match video cards, max res, number and type of inputs, hdmi 1.4, 2.0? Is Displayport 1.2 enough?  I finally narrowed down to a 30-32 inch 21:9 ultrawide, curved, (gaming) monitor though I would only use it for business. I need a split screen with quick and easy transition from one input to another. To change inputs from one PC to another on this monitor requires 11 button pushes and the dual split-screens are squished horizontally as determined by the screen width and 2560hz horizontal resolution. Nothing really wrong with the monitor itself. My opinion is that this monitor should be best acknowledged as a single input Gaming monitor. It was not quite suitable for my application. Better would be a wider monitor with higher horizontal frequency.<br/>  The Wall Plate though not it's intended use can be  attaching it to a standard 4 hole Vesa mounting arm plate. It comes with a 75mm 4 hole Adapter, so it can be done. Two little bolts attach one side to the monitor, the other side can be fastened to a regular Monitor mounting plate (75mm hole pattern) on the extended arm of your vesa desktop stand mounted to your desk .  You will have to obtain an additional four M4 x 20mm bolts, with washers and nuts to bolt (fasten) Wall Mount to the Vesa plate of your stand. Easily accomplished except for  obtaining your own hardware. No wall plate screws are supplied as there are different types of wall mounts.<br/>  At this price point, as I've mentioned, this monitor is designed to work best with a PC having an Nvidia Video Card using GSync. They tell you up front how it's designed to work. With the right hardware you can get the 160 - 200 hz frequency for high-end gaming. With Displayport 1.2  I was able to get 120hz picture that was good enough for ordinary Windows 10 desktop, but I can't comment how it would work for gaming. Need Displayport 1.4, or Hdmi 2.0 to obtain 160-200hz. The Nvidia drivers must be up to date and can be downloaded from Nvidia Website. The driver page lists a long paragraph of Nvidia cards compatible with that driver. It may work well enough with other PC video cards as well, but I was using an old GT 620. No problem with the latest driver but not suitable for intensive gaming.<br/>  Using with a Mac, (I have a Macbook Pro) is a crapshoot. Older Macs are designed to work with older Mac compatible hardware. This monitor, as is the case with the majority of OEM generic monitors, is directed at the Windows PC Market. If it works with your Mac, well and good, but don't count on it, not for serious gaming for sure. My 2011 Macbook Pro has early thunderbolt - backwards compatible with mini-displayport. I used a mini-displayport cable with short mini-displayport to Displayport adapter. Macbook has a 2560x1440 spec video output. It connected with the monitor but full-screen picture was a little vertically flattened, (i.e.horizontall stretched); not acceptable. Mac System Preferences Display Icon showed 1080p. That is correct, but the Macbook is designed for 4:3 ratio. My Macbook was never intended to handle 21:9 aspect ratio; not the fault of the monitor. Works perfect though with my 21.5 inch Acer screen. Newer macs with thunderbolt 3, a.k.a. USB-C should be compatible with USB-C input monitors.<br/>  In order to avoid the hassle of a return, my advice is to ask the seller - better yet, download the manual, especially with third-party sellers as return shipping is pretty expensive. Be aware of the intended use and specs and consider that in order to get a monitor with better options, you might have to spend another $100.00 or more.  What I could determine is that used as intended and properly set up, it will do what is advertised at 160hz For business, with dual inputs, maybe not, but the manufacturer does not advertise it as anything but designed for gaming so I really can't complain. I had to try it to find out.<br/><br/>Walter O.</span>

<span>I bought this monitor for work 2 months ago as I became tired of looking at my small laptop screen. The size of this is perfect for having two programs up at the side by side without having an extra monitor. I am not gaming on this monitor, so I have yet to test the gaming experience. The colors however are a little bit off and you definitely see some ghosting effects when moving your mouse or dragging programs around. With the stand that comes with it, you cannot adjust the height of the monitor, just the tilt. I paired it with a mounting arm to help with that. For work, I have no major complaints as it serves its purpose.</span>

<span>I’ve had this screen over 3 years. At first I was skeptical about it being it wasn’t a name brand and the price but I took a gamble. I have no issues getting to the 200Hz range of course paired with a good video card I shouldn’t. I had issues in the beginning but it was my VC firmware. After the update I haven’t had any other issues. I use the DP connection. Ensure you go buy you a good DP cable because cheap ones will not work as intended. I planned on keeping it for 4 years so it is time for me to get rid of it with my new build the end of the year. Definitely would recommend this to anyone looking for a budget screen and knows what they are doing to get the most out of it. If you don’t cheap out on your VC and cable you’ll be fine.</span>

<span>I’ve been using a TV for years. Decided to pick this monitor up when I upgraded to PC. I’ve ran my Series X on this and the picture quality was amazing. It’s great refresh rate definitely made a difference. Then in the PC it got even better. Everything is high quality  My only complaint is the UI on the monitor is a little frustrating to use.</span>

<span>The monitor is great no doubt, although if you just bought a pc and need a monitor to start off with this is great. Some things I dislike about it though were the speakers aren’t the best but they do the job for example I can watch movies and YouTube on it no problem but if you want to listen to music somewhat loud with bass the monitor just won’t keep up with that. No hate though everything else like the quality I was really impressed with. The led’s are nice as well.</span>

<span>I currently have a 32" Samsung Curved FHD 240Hz panel for gaming. Wanted another one that is smaller and thought, what the heck, can always return to Amazon if this doesn't perform. Well, I'm impressed 100%. The picture is actually better than my Samsung on COD Vanguard. FPS, smoothness and brightness are all fantastic. The panel is likely made by Samsung, not many make these actual panels in the World. Plus, the warranty is hard to pass up. It is just as good, if not better than my Samsung which was 2x the cost for 5" larger size. Buttery smooth action and does 240Hz. Just set the Hz and screen size in COD graphics settings, and my NVDIA 3080 just screams 200+fps. Really nice. Can't go wrong. If you aren't used to a curve monitor, it takes awhile, since I already had one, no biggie. Plus, it doesn't seem 5" smaller in diagonal than my Samsung 32". Don't think you can go wrong with this thing honestly.</span>

<span>I was looking for a 144hz 1080p monitor for my 1050Ti GPU laptop, which I bought in 2017, and wanted to increase the longevity of it, as well as have a second monitor for my desk when working remotely.  The price and quality of this monitor exceeds all expectations and I was super excited in getting it and when it delivered it did not disappoint.  It being curved just adds more joy to it.<br/><br/>For 1080p gaming, this is the monitor to get!</span>

<span> I ABSOLUTELY love it! I haven't been able to game on it as I just got home to set it all up. And I'm extremely happy with this and it came with a really good price considering Samsung was trying to charge me $249. (I got it for $159)<br/>A huge steal! I look forward to playing with my friends tomorrow!!</span>

<span>This is a review for the 27 inch 144hz flat monitor<br/><br/>I just got this monitor yesterday and it's been great. I thought my old, now secondary monitor looked good but this one's even better. I'll do the standard pros and cons format, you know the drill.<br/><br/>Cons:<br/>Stock settings and presets? Complete garbage. Don't even bother. What you need to do is go into the OSD and mess with the settings until they look good.<br/><br/>First crappy setting: contrast and backlight brightness. It has that Eco-mode by default crap that makes the monitor dim and completely ruins the display quality like on TV's, you're gonna want to set the brightness up to the max 100. This is when you'll encounter the first problem: crushed whites. Things will look washed somewhat washed out, not because the colors are washed out but because the contrast is too low and the luminance is too high. I had a helpful tool for this stuff in that my older monitor is also very color accurate and I loved the image quality, and also the color settings came tuned correctly out of the box, I didn't have to mess with them much. I used it next to this monitor to fine tune the image setting to my liking. I set the contrast to 46 and that fixed the contrast problem. Looks fine now. I don't recommend messing with the gamma settings and leaving it at 1. Gamma setting 2 doesn't look great and 3 gives you crushed blacks sand makes the reds extremely overpowering. A contrast test web page is your best friend here for both contrast and color settings, especially if comparing this monitor with another one.<br/><br/>Then you'll notice the colors are off. This monitor is set to warm color temperature by default, but to me even completely flat no-change color temperature didn't look the best. It was especially noticeable on the black and white range It's like they didn't really bother to correctly tune their settings for the display. Again using my other monitor as a reference for I tuned the color temperature and ended up with these settings:<br/>Color temp- User<br/><br/>settings:<br/><br/>Red - 53<br/>Green - 50<br/>Blue - 53<br/><br/>This made the vibrancy of the blues on par with my other monitor and balanced out the vibrancy of the colors a bit more. It also made white not look off to my eyes. Some people might think the red seems a little too vibrant with these settings. I think it's fine but if this is your case id recommend lowering the red values and adjusting the other ones slightly the compensate until you have a satisfactory color pallete.<br/><br/>I highly recommend starting with these settings and changing them to your liking.<br/><br/>Don't even bother with game mode, just completely nukes the image quality for some stupid filter.<br/><br/>There's other settings in here but I personally haven't bothered with them much.<br/><br/>OSD isn't the worst thing ever but it isn't the best. Changing the color temperature preset resets your brightness and contrast setting, which was irritating during setup. If you accidentally turn the monitor off while using the OSD which I did numerous times it will not save what you just did which is also annoying.<br/><br/>Back light bleed isn't great on my specific unit but I'm not the type of person to care about backlight bleed at all, and it's not bad enough to get in my way.<br/><br/>Comes in a very gamery box that says exactly what's iinside with nice big bold pictures so all the porch pirates know who's house to steal from. If your area has a porch pirate problem I'd recommend picking it up as soon as possible after delivery or immediately after.<br/><br/>Pros:<br/>Once you're done tinkering, the display looks great. Colors are vibrant and it looks even better than my already great old monitor, and it's slightly brighter too. Refresh rate is as you'd expect from a 144hz monitor and I haven't seen any screen tearing whatsoever so I'd assume gsync is working. Very happy with it and it's very nice to look at. Good brightness, no major complaints with the panel.<br/><br/>Overdrive mode works great and is great at eliminating motion blur and ghosting. I personally have it set to maximum and have encountered no issues or artifacts.<br/><br/>The adjustable stand works well and everything hardware wise seems well built and designed.<br/><br/>Monitor has the standard thin bezels you'd expect from this kind of monitor, fits in very well with my old one and looks good.<br/><br/>Monitor isn't that gamery aside from the red accents so I'd say that's a plus for people not into that aesthetic.<br/><br/>Comes with pretty nice HDMI and Display port cables included in the box which is always nice to have.<br/><br/>Takeaway/TL:DR<br/><br/>very good monitor with some minor tinkering required. Definitely would recommend, great for gaming and really anything else. I bet SVP 4 will be great on this monitor when I get around to watching a movie on it. 4/5 stars because it's good, but has all the minor annoyances I described above and the fact that it ships in a clearly marked box. If they fixed those problems I'd definitely consider a full star rating.</span>

<span>1080p, 144hz, VRR over DP. Nice clear colors, back-light's even on mine at least. Viewing angles are wide.<br/>If you want a solid monitor for a budget gaming rig, this is it. Or a secondary monitor with DP that's not pricier.<br/><br/>ONE single criticism. Only comes with a HDMI cable. Only supports HDMI 1.4, which cannot fully drive the monitor's refresh rate max nor is it supported for Free-sync in most configurations. Best you'll get with HDMI is 1080p120hz, with no VRR.<br/><br/>Order a DP cable alongside this monitor to get it's real performance. REALLY should include one and a DP to mini-DP dongle, HDMI cable's really unnessary since it's not the best for the monitor and can be picked up anywhere... DP cables are a bit harder to source.</span>

<span>This monitor is an absolute steal! It has performed above expectation in every category. The stand that the monitor comes with is fully capable of filling whatever position that you desire it to be in, ranging from a couple inches off your desk to much more above. As it comes to performance I have seen 0 issues, no screen tearing, or any dead pixels when it was shipped to me about a month ago. The settings in the monitor are easier to navigate than any monitor I have ever had, and it’s performance for price is incalculable as an HDR 240hz monitor, with G-Sync and FreeSync (1ms response time), with a stand like no other. Samsung went above and beyond for a price point that is very much affordable. I could not recommend this monitor anymore than I already have, this is an absolutely perfect monitor. Samsung went above and beyond for this and I will give credit when credit is due. This is an unbiased opinion and this was not sponsored. Thank You</span>
