<span>Picked up a cheap and cheerful Lenovo Smart Tab M8 and started playing Real Racing 3 and my thumbs quickly got destroyed (too many past injuries and yeah, I'm officially old).  Gas and brake trigger style was WAY mo' better and  eliminated the no-touch-registered problems I was having (thought it was the cheap tablet but I guess I have sweaty thumbs??? ... I'm sounding like quite the odd job now).  Figured I would've busted something in the trigger mechanism by now but these are tougher than they seem initially and stand up to the extra squeeze when you really want to slow down or speed up quickly and can't seem to get through your thick skull that a touch on the screen is a touch on the screen. ;-)  If I eventually break them due to my over enthusiasm, I won't hesitate to buy another pair.</span>

<span>Are you gaming on a tablet or iPad? Do you play games via controls touchscreen? These handy grips really help, doesn’t matter what sort of game you play for the most part it’s easier to hold and play 100%. My hands aren’t huge but They seem to be made for kids by the size of grip. It’s not a deal breaker. Then the little spring loaded triggers are pretty awesome. It feels like I am  playing on a jumbo sized switch and I only use a iPad mini.</span>

<span>Better then what I was expecting. Let me say I was ready for a cheap feeling controller but it’s not. It has a solid build and a rubber texture on the front of the grip and all the buttons don’t feel loose. I fully charged it one day and it still has battery left after 2 days of using it. It was really easy to pair the device with my iPad and iPhone. I haven’t had any problems with the controller yet but by the looks of it I have a good feeling this controller will last a while.

<span>It does get the job done but is a bit uncomfortable at first, I would recommend if you want to get better kills on PUBG but it’s sometimes unresponsive. You’ll have to turn off your Phone and turn it back on again to get it running correctly(turning off the screen) it doesn’t really fit the iPhone X due to the camera. You’ll have to flip it to the weird side to get it to work.</span>

<span>It's a good tablet, but remember it isn't a flagship. The screen is great but remember it isn't as good as the higher models or something like an iPad pro screen. I wanted something a little smaller than my 12.9, and love that I could get the 11" at a considerable savings and keep thr 120hz screen. Once you've gotten used to anything above 60, it's so hard to go back. And don't get me started on the micro SD, it's so convenient to be able to just drop in and have extra space.<br/><br/>I think Samsung Dex is great on these devices, much better than something like the iPad pro, that we've all been promised will be able to replace a PC. But even with ios 16 it's more of the same. Picked up the pink tablet since I always put a cover on it and the savings over charcoal or silver was 60 bucks.<br/><br/>Anyway, it's a light device, screen looks good, and comes with the pencil.  Is it worth the price, I'd say definitely. Is the screen as good as my fold 4, of course not. As good as the iPad pro, no. But those devices were well over 1000 dollars and neither came with the pen. I think it comes down to your ecosystem. I have both apple and Samsung android and love the way they both handle sharing if using two apple or two Samsung devices.</span>

<span>Intro<br/><br/>Nowadays you're seeing more and more students switching from a laptop to a tablet for all of their productivity and entertainment. Although laptops are more portable than ever, It's pretty clear students appreciate an, even MORE, portable setup. That's where the Samsung Galaxy Tab S8 steps in. This is one of my favorite Android tablets on the market, but if you’re a student, it has some serious competition from Apple. So, is the Galaxy Tab S8 the best tablet for students? Well, Let’s find out!<br/><br/>Hardware<br/><br/>This year the Galaxy Tab S8 costs $50 more than its previous predecessor which is not bad considering some of the new features added. The Tab S8 is definitely not a cheap tablet, but it honestly offers a ton of awesome features that any student will appreciate who's in the market for a quality productivity-based tablet. I know some of you are debating whether you should get this or the iPad Air or Pro. And some of you are just looking for a quality android tablet for productivity and entertainment. Well, this video is for you all!<br/>When you look at the hardware of this device, it’s obvious that this thing is beautiful and there's definitely some iPad inspiration here. Anyway, On the back, you’ve got a matte aluminum finish with a glass magnet strip to connect the S Pen. On the right side is where you'll find the power button that doubles as a fingerprint scanner, the volume rockers which are tactile, and a micro SD card slot that can be expanded up to 1TB. On the left side are connectors for other accessories and on the bottom is a USB-C charging port that can charge up to 45W<br/><br/>Display<br/><br/>Flipping this device around, On the front, you’ve got an 11” 1600x2560 display. While the bezels on this device are slightly big for 2020, the display is still gorgeous and I love streaming content and playing games on its 120htz display. And the bigger bezels make it easier to hold on the hand without interfering with the view too much. In addition to being good for leisure, the display gets bright enough to read outside, so I could see this being used at any time of day, for just about anything you can imagine. I highly recommend a case or stand for this device because the edges are sharp and after long use, it's not comfortable to hold in the hand.<br/><br/>Battery<br/><br/>The 8000 mAh battery on here is also gonna make sure that this tablet goes all day. It's definitely not the best battery life I've experienced on a tablet, but it's certainly enough for long productivity sessions.  I typically get a full day of use on productivity days but when I add gaming or streaming to the mix, I do have to keep a portable charger with me.<br/><br/>Speakers<br/><br/>If you look around the sides, you’ll see four stereo speakers that get pretty loud and have clear audio quality, but you won’t see a headphone jack. Bummer. Anyway, this is probably one of the loudest speakers I've experienced on a tablet, so whether you're in a zoom meeting or listening to a lecture you won't have any trouble hearing.<br/><br/>Storage/Expandability<br/><br/>The base model of this device comes with 128GB and it’s an additional $80 for the 256GB model, and the S8 does come with a micro SD card slot, fortunately.<br/><br/>Cameras<br/><br/>The Galaxy Tab S8 has two cameras on the back, a 13mp wide-angle lens and a 6mp ultrawide lens. Photos and video are solid for a tablet, I was surprised to see that this ships with 4k at 60fps. The front camera has a 12mp 120-degree ultra-wide lens, which is great for zoom calls and conferences. It's sad that most laptops double or triple the price don't have nearly as good of a camera system compared to this device. Whether you're using it to scan documents or photography this is actually surprisingly solid.<br/><br/>Operating System and Performance<br/><br/>In terms of performance and the operating system, this ships with the new Snapdragon 8th gen Octa-Core processor, 8GB of RAM, and an Adreno 730 GPU running on Samsung’s version of Android 12. That’s really the most important reason to buy this tablet... it’s probably one of the most powerful tablets on the market. Like I mentioned before, entertainment is terrific, but this might be the best tablet for multi-tasking I’ve ever seen.<br/><br/>Samsung Dex<br/><br/>Samsung launched all their new tablets with a feature called Samsung DeX, that allows you to boot your tablet into a PC-like mode, where you can bounce between different windows of apps and move between screens easily.<br/>In the past, my biggest reason for recommending students pick up something like a Chromebook is because things like hooking your laptop up to external monitors, or multi-tasking through different windows were way easier on a Chromebook, but clearly, that's not the case anymore.<br/>Samsung also partnered with Microsoft to allow you to run excel, word, and other Microsoft apps in multiple desktop windows. So typing on this tablet is phenomenal when you hook up an external keyboard or just a keyboard case.<br/>This feature is really the best part of this tablet and honestly one of its biggest selling points.<br/><br/>S-Pen<br/><br/>In addition to DeX, is Samsung’s inclusion of the S-Pen in the box. Most students are taking notes digitally, so this is very much appreciated. There are times I honestly prefer this over the Apple pencil. I personally like how soft it feels on the screen and the paper sound it makes when you're taking notes. It's really cool that you can actually hover the s pen over certain things like the calendar to get more details without having to tap on the screen. I'd say the Apple price is slightly more accurate, but the s pen is definitely more innovative. The only thing I don't like is how it snaps to the tablet only in one orientation,  so essentially the tip has to be facing the camera for it to charge and for full magnetic power. Overall, Given how expensive adding the Apple Pen is to an iPad, I definitely think this is a great deal.<br/><br/>Price<br/><br/>And that takes me to the question you’ve been asking: is this worth the base-model, $700 price tag?<br/>I can confidently say the Galaxy Tab S8 is one of, if not the best, android tablets in its series.<br/>I think at $700 USD for the base model this is competing with the iPad Air and iPad Pro.<br/>If you absolutely know you want a tablet in this price range, I think you only go with the iPad if you want to use iMessage, sidecar, and other Apple-exclusive software features, and you go with the Tab S8 if you absolutely need a stylus and the best tablet experience on Android.</span>

<span>The tablet is all that it is advertised to be - I'm very happy with it so far.  Well, except for the fact that I couldn't start it up until I first charged it, and they DON'T include a charger!  They state that most customers already have another Samsung device so don't need another charger.  WRONG! (At least in my case.)  Their tech write-up misleads in this matter.  They either need to include a charger ($700 and no way to charge it!) or at least make it clear up front that you need to buy one separately.  That's my only complaint - otherwise this would get 5 stars...</span>

<span>We are an Android family. We are a Samsung family. We have Samsung smart phones, and watches, so when my wife's old iPad finally gave up the ghost, I asked her if it would be OK to replace it with a Galaxy tablet, which made sense to me. We are both retired so I searched for a tablet that fit our budget and at the same time would fit her needs. She mainly streams and saves recipes, so I purchased the 128 GB model since it also included the 4 GB RAM, instead of 3 GB. What a tablet. The screen is bright, the sound with the quad speakers is fantastic, and it is quick. I have yet to set it up so she can make, and receive phone calls on it, which I think she will like.<br/><br/>A day after we received it there was a huge update. It is now running Android 12, the same as our phones. The only disappointment I have found so far is not being able to connect her watch to it. I hope<br/>Samsung addresses this in the future.<br/><br/>If you are in the market for a high-end budget tablet you might give the A8 a second thought. I believe you will be pleased.</span>

<span>Updated 9/21/22<br/><br/>Beware the model they send you.  There is more than one model of the TabA8.  Unfortunately I received model SM-X200.  The Samsung updates to this model are horrendous and as a result pose a security risk to the user.  it is still on Android 11, One UI 3.1 and Android May 2022 security patch.<br/><br/>I read somewhere, not confirmed that Samsung is not updating this model of the TabA8 to Android 12 and may update it to Android 13 at some point in time after Android 13 becomes available.<br/><br/>I also have a TabA7 released one year before the TabA8  and Samsung updated my TabA7 to Android 12 months ago.  Also, Samsung keeps the TabA7 up to date on Android Security patches<br/><br/>The TabA8 works fine that is why I am not giving it a one star rating  It is also very slow to charge.  A lot slower than the TabA7.<br/><br/>I can not recommend the SM-X200 model of the TabA8 at all.  Maybe if you are in a different location this model of the TabA8 will update.<br/><br/>Updated 3/22/22 See bottom of review<br/><br/>Not reviewed for typos.<br/><br/>I ordered a 4 x 64 version.  The box said 4 x 64.  The actual device as a 3 x 32.  I contacted Amazon about the problem and they sent the correct replaement immediately and I received the replacement on the same date that i was scheduled to receive the original<br/><br/>Now about the Tab A8.  I had previously purchased a Tab A7 3 x 64 from Amazon.  You should be able to find my review of it on Amazon.  This review is bascially a comparison of the A8 with the A7.<br/><br/>First off.  I recommend against buying the A8, 3 x 32  It wasn't unitl I had used Switch to copy over my apps and data from the A7 to the original A8 that I received that I discovered they had sent me a 3 x 32 intead of a 4 x 64.  If you order the 64GB version of the A8 it automatically comes with 4GB RAM.<br/><br/>In any case the transfer of the apps and data from the A7 3 x 64 to the A8 3 x 32 took close to two hours using Samsung Switch.  Transferring the data from the A7 to the A8, 4 x 64 took less than 15 minutes.  There is no doubt that the extra 1GB  RAM and 32GB of memory makes a big difference.  The Tab A7 with 64GB is a very nice tablet but compared to the Tab A8 with 64GB the Tab 8A is signficantly faster.  I opened multiple apps and switched between them without any lag.<br/><br/>As I have posted before I am no gamer so I can't comment of the gaming capabilities of either tablet but when it comes to everything else including downloading and installing updates the Tab A8 64GB is noticeably faster than the Tab A7 64GB<br/><br/>The display comparison is bit more complicated.  The sharpness of the display is better on the A7 but the Tab A8 display at 10.5" vs 10.4" of the Tab A7 is more boxy and looks more like a desktop display than a tablet display.  I put up a video on the Tab A8 and a 23" Samsung desktop display monitor.  While some of the picture is lost on the Tab A8 it isn't a lot compared to the Tab A7 which crops off a good deal of the top and bottom.<br/><br/>For some reason, the Tab A7 has a better; i.e., signficantly louder audio than the Tab A8 both running on Android 11 with Samsung UI 3.1.  The Tab A8 audio is good for watching videos etc but the Tab A7 can give you room type audio when you are listening to music.  I can't judge the distortion but in any case while the Tab 8A audio is fine the Tab A7 audio is better.<br/><br/>While neither the Tab A7 or A8 batteries will charge very fast I haven't noticed much diffenece between the two with the Tab A8 charging a bit faster using the Samsung charging block and cable that came with the Tab A8.  No comment on battery draing speed as that will always vary based upon usage.  I ams satisfied with the battery drain speed on both the Tab A7 and Tab A8,  Then again I don't play games.<br/><br/>Final comment.  The Tab A8 is year newer so it came with Android 11 vs Android 10 for Tab A7.  So it should get one more Android update and Samsung related UI update down the road.  Both are nice tablets but the extra GB of RAM along with a different CPU makes the Tab A8 a lot more enjoyable to use.<br/><br/>Update 3/22/22<br/>Heptics -  The heptics on the Tab A8 are super sensitive which makes for very light touches.  On the Tab A7 the heptics are not nearly as sensitive.<br/><br/>Startup -  With the Tab A8 there is very little impact on usage immediately upon startup after logging in.  Upon login you should be able to alsmost immediately begin doing whatever.  On the Tab A7 you have to wait for software like anti-malware to do their thing after login before you can do much of anything.  The wait time will vary depending on your software.<br/><br/>For that reason I don't turn off the Tab A7 except when I know I won't be using it for an extended period, like a day or more.  I think the extra GB of RAM in the Tab A8 makes the difference since both my Tab A8 and Tab A7 are loaded with identical software including Android 11 and Samsung 3.1 UI.<br/><br/>Battery - Samsung UI 3.1 does a good job of saving battery after it learns which takes a few days.  Therefore, leaving the Tab A8 or Tab A7 on does not drain much battery once the devices are optimized by the Samsung software as long as you turn off the display when the devices are not in use.  I also recommend turning off the display for playing music, streaming or otherwise if you want to save on battery drain.<br/><br/>In order to assure continuous playing of music when the display is off you have go to the music playing app and turn on allow in battery saving mode.</span>

<span>I know I gave the tablet 5's across the board,  but truthfully the battery deserves a 10. I only have to charge it once or twice a week.  10.5" is the perfect size. I honestly have nothing bad to say about  it. Here's a suggestion for the seller.  Maybe put together a bundle package that includes the tablet, screen protector,  cover, and stylist. I would have loved that. As it was, I had to buy all that separately.</span>

<span>Got a solid deal on this Galaxy tablet from Amazon. I bought this tablet mainly to control the apps for my audio system because using my iPhone or Surface ties those devices up and if I walk out the room with them Tidal and other apps will quit streaming.<br/><br/>Here’s what I like -<br/><br/>- Easy set up<br/>- clear screen<br/>- thin and lightweight<br/>- works great for all audio apps including Amazon Music, Tidal music streaming, SVS subwoofer control app, Sony headphone app, HEOS for Denon, BluOs for my BluOs Node 2i, and Audacy to name a few.<br/>-USB C connector - none of the annoying Apple lightning connector nonsense and expense. I think Apple is being forced to change the lightning connector in 2023 thanks to the European Union ruling.<br/><br/>What I don’t like<br/>-wish the battery were more robust. It seems to need charging more than I thought it would. It helps to close out all back ground apps when powering the tablet off.<br/>- Slippery case - I added a protective case<br/>- the facial recognition is not refined, it can be hit or miss<br/>- a little annoying to type on because the typing screen is not large. I have a Bluetooth keyboard for longer typing sessions<br/><br/>Overall, this is a slick tablet and it’s got exactly what I need for my audio system and the odd foray into the web. Hope that helps!</span>

<span>I am not an Android guy. Although I am always fascinated by Android devices and products. I have owned quite a few Chinese knock-offs and a few Xiaomi brand phones but nothing ever lasted. In retrospect, I didn’t give them much of a chance. I am an Apple guy. I love Mac and Apple products. What I don’t like? The price. What I do like? The quality. Apple has maintained quality products for some time. I’ve had many iPhones, iPads, Mac Pros, Macbook Pros, Macbooks, Mac minis, and iMacs. Our whole office here in Ghana is on mac. Why? Reliability and longevity. Ok, so I’ve got the fanboying out the way, on to the subject of this post.<br/><br/>Why did you buy this thing?<br/>Well, simply put, on one of my trips back to the US earlier this year, my 13″ Macbook Pro died and I needed a replacement. I loved the 13″ size for going back and forth to the office and it was a good “beater” laptop. I have a loaded 16″ Macbook Pro that I prefer to keep in pristine shape for editing video and graphics. I figured let’s try the 12.4″ tablet and see if it can handle what I am throwing at it.<br/><br/>I LOVE THIS TABLET.<br/><br/>I am typing on it right now for this post. I was skeptical of having an Android tablet after having a few knock-offs and bad experiences with them, but this thing just keeps getting better. The only downside? No iMessaging or integration of Mac apps. I can live without that. In fact, it has me wondering if I should switch all of my note-taking, list-making, and stuff to Google apps.<br/><br/>Speed<br/>This thing is fast. I’m not just talking fast, I’m talking lighting fast. I am constantly shocked at how responsive and quick everything is. Websites load fast, apps load without hesitation, and streaming is a joy. With the Qualcomm SM7225 Octa-Core processor, this thing delivers. My kids use iPad devices for streaming and sometimes school. My son has one of the later models of the regular iPad. This Samsung tab smokes it. I mean trail of fire smokes it.<br/><br/>Screen<br/>The screen on this device is one of the best I’ve ever seen or used. I’m serious. I like it better than the iPads I own. It’s clear, and crisp and the 4K video looks incredible on it. Let’s put it this way, I’d rather watch Netflix on this tablet than on my 16″ Macbook Pro. Even when viewing bad or old footage on YouTube, I’ve found the quality is amazing. I’m not sure what they’re doing over there at Samsung but they better keep doing it. If you don’t believe me, go find one on display at a store. You’ll be a believer quickly. Even with fingerprints of my own and my kids, this thing is still crisp and clear. For what it’s worth, I do not put on-screen protectors on my devices. I don’t like the loss of clarity and function with screen protectors.<br/><br/>Battery Life<br/>I have yet to have this thing die on me. Granted I don’t use it enough to kill the battery. Even after two days of not being on the charger, it was still at 60%. I couldn’t believe it. Time will tell how long that lasts but if it’s this good to start with I don’t feel worried about that at all. Maybe when I fly again back to the States I’ll test how long it lasts on a flight.<br/><br/>Accessories<br/>With this tablet, I bought the Amazon suggested keyboard and case made by Fintie. For all intents and purposes, it’s not a bad case. Do I wish I had bought the Samsung keyboard and case? Sure. But the cost was a bit high and I didn’t think it was a deal-breaker on the tablet. The Fintie case works well enough and offers a few options for pen storage. I do like that the tablet came with a tablet pen which is a good selling point, even if you don’t use it.<br/><br/>Conclusion<br/>All in all, this tablet is a winner. The screen alone is worth the price but as an added bonus the speed just feels unmatched. If I had to go back and choose again, I’d likely choose it again. If you’re an Apple person, like I am, this is a worthy device to add to your arsenal.</span>

<h2 style="text-align: center;">FAQS</h2>
<h3><h3>Can I play PUBG on a tablet?</h3></h3>
    

PUBG can be played on a tablet, but the experience may not be as good as on a PC or console.
<h3><h3>Which tab is best for gaming?</h3></h3>
    

There is no definitive answer for this question as different gamers have different preferences. Some people prefer the desktop tab when gaming, while others find that the tab with the most gaming-specific features – such as the NVIDIA shield tablet – is best for them. Ultimately, it comes down to personal preference.
