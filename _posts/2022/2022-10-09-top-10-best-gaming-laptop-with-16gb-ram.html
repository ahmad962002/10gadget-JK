<span>Tldr: it's a good laptop that has 1 open nvme slot if you want to expand your storage and it has 1 open Ram slot for expanding your ram. It's worth investing the 20 or so dollars to get another 8 gig 3200 speed ram sitck, if you want.<br/><br/>it came with 8 gigs of single rank 3200 speed Ram, a 3rd gen 512 GB Samsung nvme I think it was 3200 mb/s read and I want to say 2200mb/s write and one nvme slot unpopulated, Realtek ethernet/Wi-Fi 6 capable wireless card, no SSD cradle (just in case you are looking at YouTube videos and saw that one was installed in there) its fine and a 3060 Max P if I remember correctly.<br/><br/>Here's where things got a little frustrating.<br/><br/>I had to plug it in before the power button would power on the computer despite it having 40% battery (this only happened once), it took a lot longer to boot the first time; long enough I thought it was broken and then the screen turned on. Windows 11 came installed and was about a year out of date (last november 2021), which is understandable stuff sits in a warehouse but it's kind of buggy till you run Windows update, so do that first thing then install your programs or some won't open when you try to run them (happened to me)<br/><br/>Now the ram situation. Amd processors work much better with dual channel ram which means two sticks of ram not one 8 gig stick. Its unacceptable at this price point (my opnion), that said it was doable on 8 gigs; when you take into account switchable graphics mode takes 2 gigs of ram the cpus on chip graphics this leaves you with 6 gigs for system tasks, but once you start getting stuff installed Windows uses about 4 gigs of RAM leaving you 2 gigs free. I just don't know how 8 gigs of RAM is sufficient these days given what I mentioned, that said it did surprisingly well in cyberpunk on mostly high settings at 1080p.<br/><br/>Secure boot was enabled by default which is kinda annoying because if you wanna run Linux you have to disable that if I remember correctly and amd's platform security processor was also enabled by default as well. most people won't care about this or even know what they are but it's an annoyance for people who want to install other operating systems ( just hit F2 while the computer is booting if you want secure boot disabled)<br/><br/>I didn't feel right not mentioning these things, it's something I wouldve wanted to know before purchasing if I didn't know much about computers. Overall I'm happy it just took a second to get it setup and running optimally.</span>

<span>I'm an interior design student that needed a computer for Adobe and Autodesk programs, sometimes multiple at the same time, while having a browser open. It definitely works! But I also wanted a computer I could play games on, like genshin and nier. SMOOOOTH! I absolutely love it and I'm glad I chose this over msi delta 15.</span>

<span>I have built my own computers since 1999.  I know what I want in them and how much it's gonna cost me.  I never buy the latest stuff, I keep it about a year old and has served me well.  But this time after a friend's advice I dove into the gamin laptop and am very pleased.  No it's not the legion 7 but it's new and has what I need.  Quick fire up, minimal bloat software, slapped in another 1 TB drive, created my local account, updated everything, loaded MW and I was off to the races.  Great machine.  I will be getting the 80 watt battery to give it the power boost it needs to really open it up.  Very happy.  We'll worth it and highly recommend.<br/><br/>8/23<br/>Quick update.  This laptop is great.  I have the HDR setting turned on with no issues.  4k will only run at 60 fps but the picture is outstanding and doesn't really task the processor or vid card.  I recommend the RAM upgrade.  It comes with 16 gig of ddr4 and is actually the sweet spot for most everything but boosting to 32 gig of ddr4 really gives it a lot more breathing room to perform.<br/>I would get a stand or something for airflow.  I love AMD but they are a hot runner compared to Intel.  But this thing does have an awesome cooling system as long as you've got the bottom vents unobstructed.  Heat is the enemy.<br/>Windows 11 is actually a very good OS.  I found a cheap metal stand that works perfect.  I work in Engineering IT and have delt with every os since win 95 so seen the good and the bad.<br/>Just my 2 cents and hope it helps some folks</span>

Recibí exactamente lo que el proveedor describe.<br/>Honestamente tenía un poco de recelo en pedir éste artículo por que en las reseñas de envíos a Latinoamérica mencionaban sucesos lamentables. Lo que decidí hacer por la oportunidad que tenía fue pedir el artículo a casa de un familiar que vive en Estados Unidos y posteriormente éste familiar me lo envió a la Ciudad de México, no sé si ésto haya ayudado en realidad a recibir el objeto adecuado.<br/>Finalmente, aún así me salió barata comparando con su precio en México.</span><span class="cr-translated-review-content aok-hidden"></span>

<span>First I will say like others have said it does come with 20 gb ram  in it. The price isn't to bad and the overall experience of use was alright, but I expected with so much ram that I wouldn't have much issue but I did. I am horrible at closing tabs I will find something and want to check it out later and leave the tab up. A few days of this and I get 10+ tabs up. That is where the issue happens it can not run great with a lot of tabs open. I have a gaming laptop I bought in 2013 that runs way better then it with this. I still would have given the laptop a higher rating but because I wasn't happy with the fact that it couldn't handle one of my main issues I returned it. The problem was they charged me around $100 restocking fee. I think it came out to exactly 20%. I wasn't told there would be a restocking fee and when I called up amazon to find out if I missed something they agreed and sent the company a message. A short bit later I got an email from them saying they were allowed to charge me that, so I called amazon again and asked what was going on. They still agreed with me that I shouldn't have been charged the fee and are trying to deal with it.  I almost never do reviews but I felt after this experience if you are on the fence this might help.  I am not saying it is a terrible product but I won't buy from the seller again after my experience. If they had been up front about the restocking fee it would have been a bit different but $100 for a $470 laptop( when I bought it that is what it was) is way to much imo<br/><br/>TLDR: the laptop isn't bad for the price but I don't trust the seller anymore so that is why my ratings is so low. If you don't do a lot of stuff on it the laptop isn't bad but if you keep a lot of tabs up like me I would look for something else.<br/><br/>Edit: I just got a message back from the company which said to look at amazons return policy and a link to it and I clicked it but it said they could only take 20% if it took more then 30 days to return and I returned it in less then 20 days, so now I  changed the rating froma 2 to a 1 because they are so incompetent that they sent me proof that they cheated me out of $100</span>

<span>Bought this to replace an ancient Lenovo laptop.  This is not a daily use machine, but one I carry down to our winter home, and use under the stars when out with a telescope.  As such, most of what I’ve done with it has been loading the necessary software for both uses.  Have been satisfied with the system so far.<br/><br/>I did have to buy a portable CD to load software, a 4 port USB 3.0 powered hub (you know the old saying... one can never be too rich, too thin, or have too many ports!) And a USB 3.0 card reader since couple of my cameras use Compact Flash cards.<br/><br/>I really like the back lit keyboard.  It will make using the machine under the stars much easier since I won’t have to hold a flashlight in my teeth while looking up stuff in Megastar with the keyboard.<br/><br/>Love the fast 5 second boot and speed of the machine is far better than the old Lenovo.<br/><br/>Good purchase.</span>

<span>Overall, the laptop works fine. I got it as a graduation gift and plan to use it throughout undergrad. However (and this drives me absolutely crazy), the screen is constantly yellow. I've fiddled with the settings multiple times, and sometimes, the screen will appear normally like it should, but most of the time it has a yellow sheen. This makes it so that the screen itself is super dim. If you use a dark app (say Spotify), when you return to a lighter screen, it's darker than before. I know it can be lighter because when it's plugged in, the screen is bright, even if still yellow, but as soon as you unplug it, it's super dim, even when brightness is turned all the way up. Makes it almost impossible to use in bright light, like sitting outside or even in my room with the screen facing a window. It seems like it's a problem with the computer because a bunch of other people online have the same issue and no one seems to have found a way to definitively fix it. Sometimes the computer just freezes too. Not very often, but it will just freeze and I have to force shut it down and hope it turns back on right. Considering that's what happened to my last computer, I am not a very happy camper at the moment.<br/><br/>As someone with OCD, the screen drives me crazy and makes me want to scream. Definitely not worth the massive price tag, and now I'm stuck with it for at least four years or until it kicks the bucket.</span>

<span>First of all, this review is for my specific model, 2.8GHz I5, SSD+Mech drive, no touchscreen, Amazon combines similar product reviews.  This product had either systemic problem or was defective leading to poor performance, and it was returned.  The nitty gritty is below, but the executive summary is the processor was locked at 0.4GHz, one sixth it's rating.  Imagine buying a Ferrari capable of 240 MPH, and when it arrived it was governed to 40MPH.  I was hoping to work through the issues with dell, but when they turned the tables asking for payment to support a brand new unit, i thought they deserved it back.<br/><br/>I spent about 10 hours trying to fix this.  I narrowed it down to the processor thinking it was dissipating 85 watts, which would be a remarkable feat, since the power adapter is only 65 watts.  The speedshift power saving in the chip figures it would be burning up (even though the temps were fine), so it throttled to min speed.  When I was ready to give up I figured I'd call dell.  The level one tech did find a driver or two that the update drivers tool did not find, and he installed them over a period of 90 minutes.  When this did not fix it, he told me he would send an email that would allow me to have a 'software specialist' work on it.  I got the email and it requires a $100 payment prior to the work beginning, are you kidding Dell, I just bought the thing!  So, they got their speed locked and .4GHz product back.</span>

<span>I was looking for a sub $1000 laptop that I could use for school/productivity, but also to play games when I'm back from campus (since I use a PC on campus and I don't bring it back every time I go back home since its an 6 hour drive). This laptop does exactly that, and honestly exceeds my expectations for a laptop of this price. The keyboard is absolutely phenomenal, I haven't tested the more intensive games yet on the laptop but so far everything is silky smooth, and I am able to play games in lecture more effectively than before. Only complaint is the battery life, which only lasts a little over a 2-3 hour lecture with the battery power set to slightly better performance doing almost nothing, though for me its not much of a problem since I can charge it between classes.<br/><br/>TLDR:<br/>If you're looking for a laptop to use while not plugged in for long periods of time then this may not be the right choice for you, but it shines in every other aspect as a $1000 "budget" purchase.</span>

<span>If you compare this to other Windows laptops, this is a beautiful, ultra-lightweight, ultra-portable one. But even in that comparison, you have an important "but". Consider that I am using the basic configuration: AMD 4800HS, GTX 1650 with 60HZ display. Playing only League of Legends, viewing HD movies and videos, and also working in Data Science.<br/><br/>When playing LoL under low specs or watching an HD movie, this laptop can easily heat above 60 degrees celsius. If you want, you can personalize the cooling system to high cooling to avoid 60°C or whatever mark you think is too hot. But it would be super noisy.<br/><br/>Why am I stating this point? An M1 Mac under heavy processor usage would stay around 40°C, and that's without any cooling. Even the Mac Pro from 2019 won't surpass 50°C under heavy usage. Why is heating important? Because any electronic would face a shorter life if it's usually operated under high temperatures. Also, a laptop operating on 60°C or 70°C is annoying to work with if you want to use it on your lap.<br/><br/>Of course, you can take this laptop to its maximum performance, using any Data Science algorithm that could use 100% CPU for one hour and/or 100% GPU. You would see fast results, ones that usually you would only expect on a desktop PC. But it will heat up to 100°C, and to keep it running, the cooling system should be at it 100% where the noise would be very annoying.<br/><br/>Considering the heat produced under medium usage, a better idea could be to buy a bigger windows laptop where cooling is easier or think about M1 Macs. Who knows, an M1 Mac could let you play LoL with high specs and never heating above 40°C.<br/><br/>Finally, the famous 8hr battery life only applies when your processing usage is super low. Playing LoL under low specs would dry it on 3 hours.</span>

<span>The g14 is an amazing laptop for the money, all the power you could want with none of the sacrifices. It has some quirks though like having to enable a Dolby profile to relize the full potential of its well above average speakers, or having to hibernate/reboot the laptop every 2 charge cycles to match the 10 hours of light use it should get, or even needing to install a 3rd party app to reign in the loud at idle fans. The listing might say touch screen or 144hz for the base model but that is not the case, the 60hz non touch panel it actually has is a little dim, but with some very good colors. Not something I can use outside comfortably but for indoor media consumption it's very nice, especially with how nice the built in speakers are. As for prefomance its well equipt to play any games at it's 1080p resolution at 60hz, and while the fans get a bit loud, there are seemingly no thermal throttling issues. The build quality is good but not exceptional, it's solid but you can tell with things like the plastic bottom panel that it's not a MacBook but it still manages to feel more then sturdy. Over all it's a great laptop for the money, if you address those quirks I mentioned above</span>

<span>Do not be fooled: the battery will not last for 10 hours. 2-3 hours tops before you have to plug it in.

<span>I wanted a laptop that was perfect for the kind of gaming I do, And this one has went above and beyond my expectations. I have had this laptop for a few months now, And have no complaints. The finger print scanner on it is really cool, And allows me to access my computer more quickly instead of typing in a password. This laptop is also quiet, And I find my games load alot faster then my friends (Who are using PC's). This was well worth the price, And highly recommend this laptop for anyone who wants to have a gaming laptop that can also work as an office laptop.</span>

<span>Okay so I had just got my first job at Burger King. And man I was grinding like crazy. I decided to get a laptop since I never had one and I wanted something good. Especially for mt first. I did research and this thing was everywhere as top 2 best. It has Incredible Power and Speed, super Smooth, Customizable, and the essential Ports I wanted.<br/>My logic was I'd I buy a machine made for handing Bit Projects (Gaming) then ofc it would also do everything else Really good right? And Im Proud to say I was right. I've written A few docs on it. Search the Web. Played GTA and Fortnite on it and it runs really well. I was finally able to play with Mods. I had been Wanting to do so since it came out on PC. I still have it here with me. In grey's condition. I take of this Bad boy real Well. And I just love it man. I'm proud of my Choice for my First Laptop. 100% Recommend  you get one. Especially for only $1k-1200</span>

<span>I will likely update this review or add another one in a few months time but my first impressions of the laptop are that it's very fast reliable and can run modern games in high settings.

<span>It is a really good looking laptop, the I/O at the back makes cable management when 'docked' very easy.<br/>It has great performance, especially in multithreaded applications, if you have an extra buck or two rather go for the 3060 variant, for mainly the more vram, that was unfortunately not in my budget. Still I am very happy with the performance.<br/>The screen is absolutely brilliant. It the ufo ghosting test it makes my separate display look like trash. It has vibrant colours, high brightness, the high refresh rate is wonderful.<br/>The keyboard is very nice and the only complaint I have for the trackpad is that is could have been a little bit bigger, however with this type of laptop, one usually uses it with a mouse, but something to keep in mind.<br/>The cooling fans can get quite loud, but is is more of a whoosh sound than a whiny sound, so it is not really irritating, however if you are buying a gaming laptop, you are probably not buying it for being quiet. When doing lighter tasks like web browsing and using office applications, on the auto power setting, it is quiet 90% of the time, it only gets loud when doing heavy tasks, and then it is in performance mode. Quiet mode is always deathly quiet.<br/>The battery is surprisingly good for a gaming laptop, keep  in mind this is in quiet mode, using the internal gpu, lower brightness and only web browsing, office and reading PDFs, but I have gotten 5-6 hours out of this machine which is actually what they advertised, which is nice to see, usually the advertised numbers for battery is impossible to obtain, so I am happy to see that it is accurate. I have not checked at what framerate the monitor runs in the lower power mode, but since the only predefined option is 165 I presume it runs at 165, so by creating a lower refresh rate setting manually, it could improve battery life even more.<br/>Speakers are meh, but it is laptop speakers, so I was not expecting anything fancy, if you have money for this just use headphones or earphones if you are doing anything where sound quality is important, or you care about bass.</span>

<blockquote><em><div class="a-row a-spacing-small review-data"><span class="a-size-base review-text review-text-content" data-hook="review-body">
<span>Why did I buy this?<br/><br/>I was looking for a laptop that I can use for work, travels easy, but can afford me some game time when I am on the road.  Budget wasn’t really an issue, but I wanted to make sure I was getting the most value for what I spent.  I do not do intensive work applications on it just email, excel, general surfing etc.  I am not a competitive gamer, so getting that extra millisecond of response time was not a concern but I wanted something that could handle current games and most games that will come out over the next couple of years.<br/><br/>What I considered / compared it too?<br/><br/>GPU – GTX 1650 – this thing rocks, most comparisons were to the older (but still capable) 1050i and other variations.  I wanted the newest I could get for the cost.  So this was the bench mark of my search.<br/><br/>Processor – 9th gen i5 – I really wanted to get a 9th gen i7 but, most of the ones that had it only had the 1050 series of graphics card, and as I stated above that’s what I really valued most.<br/>NOTE: Lenovo DOES make a version of this with a gen 9 i7, it is not available (at the time of writing this) on Amazon. It IS available on Lenovo’s website for about $180 more than this unit (on sale for $270 off ATM), but it comes with a smaller SSD.  I know its easier to replace an SSD than a GPU (basically impossible on a laptop like this) but between the cost difference and not having to hassle with adding an SSD right when I received it, that’s why I decided against that route.<br/>NOTE: the benchmark testing on a gen 9 i5 vs i7 were very close in most tests, while future proofing your purchase is a good idea, it didn’t look like a big enough difference (4 cores 8 threads on the 5 vs 6 cores 12 threads on the 7) to move me to spend more.<br/>NOTE: This laptop model might be an Amazon exclusive because I could not locate it on the Lenovo web site.<br/><br/>Monitor refresh – 60Hz – this was a tough one for me, there are some laptops that have the 9th gen i7, 16gb ram and the 1650 graphics card with 144Hz monitor (and there is a difference, just watch some youtube videos on it) but that cost difference was about $450.  For the games I play (will get to that in a second), the look, and the weight of the product, I just couldn’t pull the trigger on the extra costs.<br/><br/>RAM – 8GB – documents state that you can upgrade the single 8GB stick to 16GB. 16GB DDR4 is about 70 bucks, if I get into a game that is giving me performance issues, I am ok with that upgrade cost.<br/>NOTE: Lenovo says you should use an authorized tech to upgrade your RAM/SSD or you might void the warranty.  I am not sure of the legality of that due to the right to self-repair, but I have done enough that it doesn’t concern me, your views/value my differ from mine in this respect.<br/><br/>512gig SSD – I definitely wanted an SSD, boot speeds etc are totally worth it. 512 means I can fit about 6+ of today’s modern games on it comfortably.  I am ok with that for now.  It does have an extra 2.5” bay for another SSD (I have a 1TB from my old laptop so if I get to the point where I need it, it won’t cost me anything extra, obviously your experience will differ from mine in that additional cost).  The extra bay is nice because you do not have to reload the OS etc, you can add the drive and increase your storage easily.  The NOTE above on the RAM upgrade applies here too.<br/><br/>The Look – As I mentioned I will be using this for work too, this is as discrete of a “gaming” laptop as I have seen.  I did not want flashy lights or gaming brand logos on the cover.  I have the power to game; I don’t need or want to flaunt it in my day job interacting with customers.<br/><br/>Keyboard backlight – has 3 settings, off, low, high.  I play in a pretty dark room and the low setting was perfect to let me see while not blinding my peripheral vision.<br/><br/>Heat – this is not a loud laptop (fans); I have been gaming on laptops for 10 years an have had my fair share of jet engines.  This doesn’t appear to be one of those.  It does get warm, but nothing of concern or that would burn to the touch.<br/><br/>Battery life – I haven’t tested it yet completely (will update when I do) but in “economy” mode (not using the 1650 graphics card) it looks to last 5+ hours, the description says 9 hours but I doubt that, still its more than enough for when I can’t plug in.  Running with the 1650 turned on and gaming I would get around 2 hours.<br/><br/>Bloat – amazingly it didn’t come with much on it that I had to remove.  MacAfee and a Lenovo thing, that’s about it.<br/><br/>What games do I play on it?<br/>No Man’s Sky Beyond – Played on high settings with no issues/lag/clipping at all<br/>WoW – Ultra settings with no issues (obviously its an older games graphics wise)<br/>Overwatch – Ultra Settings with no issues<br/>As I play and test more games ill update this…..<br/>9/29/19 EDIT - Borderlands 3 - 30 FPS on Ultra, dialed back to medium and was more than great for my average gamer needs.<br/>11/30/19 EDIT - Thrown a ton of games at this over the past few months.  Basically anything made before 2018 you can run at max with no issues.  Most newer games (2019 releases) will run just fine at med/high settings.<br/>12/10/20 EDIT - Cyberpunk 2077 - played on Medium in game settings with no issues at all. prob could have bumped it up a setting.<br/><br/>What about the backlight/bleeding reports?<br/>Ill knock on wood, I have not seen bleeding on the edges for darker games, or I might just not be noticing it.  backlight/monitor darkness, again, I have not experienced this, and I hope I don’t.  I get that everyone has defects and a % of DOA product.  Everyone’s mileage will differ on this I guess.</span>

<span>If you're gonna plunk the better part of $1k on new tech (that you'll have for years to come), it's important to get a total, accurate look at what this laptop is and is not:<br/><br/>I want to address the positives AND the (very few) negatives.<br/><br/>Yeah, it's not a bleeding-edge gaming laptop w/ a hot &amp; heavy RTX card in 'er. But - I've been playing a dozen games ranging from Fallout 4 to GTA 5,  to Cyberpunk 2077, &amp; more. CP2077 is the one game that can't be run at ultra/high settings. But, w/ some tuning/tweaks, it'll still run ~60fps on medium. **Note about FHD screen and certain games running @1080p/60Hz/FPS below in the paragraph on the screen**<br/><br/>Lenovo's keyboard are legendary. Clicky-clacky enough yet smooth and buttery. Having a keyboard w/ nearly full-sized key and a 10-key makes all the difference for me personally. Keyboard is beautifully &amp; evenly backlit in blue; and can be set to 'low', 'high', or off.<br/><br/>Touchpad is standard and full clickable. Of note if you like to turn off touch "Taps" (I despise tap-to-click...Grrr...), I discovered that Windows 10 has no easy way to disable that "feature" in Control Panel. I had to slog through RegEdit to find the correct value and set it to "0". Problem solved!<br/><br/>The FHD/1080P screen is gorgeous. Windows 10's default display settings can cause a situation in which some legacy windows within the OS are displayed at a lower resolution, creating blurry text and border lines. This is a known issue across all FHD screens, laptop or desktop, and the fault lies w/ Windows 10, not you &amp; I, or the laptop. Google will produce a simple fix, and somebody has created a small (kilobites) file that will switch your display settings to fix this problem.<br/><br/>Let's talk about the bread-and-butter part of the Lenovo L340: The video card is Nvidia's GeForce GTX 1650; a capable video card, even in the day of the RTX2080 monsters. Will it play every current AAA-title at Ultra settings? No...sadly. But it WILL play every AAA-title currently out as of May 17th, 2021 at reasonably acceptable quality. And the 2-5yr old games (and older, of course) look incredible running on High or Ultra settings.<br/><br/>Playing Fallout 4 on High setting, w/ textures/fade/water/light on Max/Ultra, it runs sustained @60FPS (capped by default, and fine by me in this case) even while exploring &amp; shooting hordes of enemies in the midst of downtown Boston. Most Fallout 4 fans know downtown Boston to be the game's chokepoint; where consoles and older PC GPUs start dropping frames hard, and everything becomes choppy - even sometimes causing the dreaded CTD.<br/><br/>Windows 10 is Windows. After the horrific ess known as Windows 7&amp;8, I switched back to running Linux boxes or Windows 7 (running Classic Shell) for games, &amp; vowed to not.come back until Microsoft got rid of that Metro crap. I want my OS to look and work like an OS...<br/><br/>...Anyway, when I finally was forced to adopt Windows 10 when my last laptop went Tango-Uniform and I bought this Lenovo L340. And I actually, genuinely like it. This is what 7 &amp; 8 should have been. Metro app clicky-touchy nonsense if you OPT for it, or, an OS for those of us who prefer it.<br/><br/>Last, I just want to say that Lenovo as a company has been pretty good to me. I've owned 5 Lenovo laptops in about 10 years. Two for work (I can't recall model #s), one of which is in my work truck currently, and the one before it that died from living full-time w; roasting hot or freezing cold, dusty, humid, smoky, vibrating/shaking and constant daily abuse over a 5-year period.<br/><br/>One my oldest daughter has used almost 4 years now for college. I hear it's holding up well, and I've been spared having to be "tech support" for any issues.<br/><br/>My last one died completely after almost 6 years of OUTSTANDING service. I burned two full spindles (200 DVDs worth) and a good chunk of a third making work-related copies and backups. Never, ever made a coaster. That drive was so sweet, I salvaged it. Thousands of hours on and productive. I actually wore a soft spot in the 10-key. Then the FN key stopped responding. Then the touchpad stopped. One day, I went to start working and it refused to turn on at all. Wouldn't run diagnostics, BIOS was unusable. Toast.<br/><br/>So if I get 5 years out of my new L340, I will be a happy man.</span>

<span>Paraphrase: this is a great laptop although it does not meet the standards for modern gaming. I use this for school and work opposed to a standard laptop or CrApple laptop. I own one of these for years and always used it with a cooling pad and charger in.<br/>Although by today's standards it is not the most up-to-date laptop for gaming I had this laptop since early 2019. It handled playing games well on high quality and you could boost things like campaign and story mode which didn't require a lot of network bandwidth. I used the laptop for school and work and fun and I literally left it plugged in with the battery on conservation mode for most of its life. It is important to note that I always use the cooling pad which greatly extends the lifetime of your laptop and reduces The strain the laptop experiences when cooling itself down. Shout out to my friend Jordi for telling me about cooling pads. If you made it this far in the review you might be wondering why the laptop broke. My cat jumped up on it and laid against the screen which made the screen do yoga and cracked the motherboard. I take full responsibility for letting the cat on my laptop. While I upgraded to a Lenovo legion laptop with a RTX 3050 TI graphics card, I would still be using this laptop today had it not broke. And some of the reviews I see that some people get defective laptops, but a good one of these will last you years if you keep up on the maintenance and use a cooling pad.</span>

<span>First off, performance on this laptop is great. The i5-9300h will pretty much be able to do anything except for the heaviest tasks, while the GTX 1650 can handle a large variety of games, though the most graphics intense games will need medium to low settings. While there are only 8 GB of RAM, in my usage (internet browsing, college work, occasional gaming) that has never been a problem. Again, this isn't the absolute most powerful laptop, but it is probably far above average in performance. Battery life is surprisingly good for a gaming laptop, especially if you undervolt (which I did by -125 mV if you're interested), and it runs relatively cool as well, rarely going over 80 C.<br/><br/>I personally really like the minimalist design, with blue accents instead of the "gamer" red, so this won't turn too many heads in a professional meeting. The screen bezels are relatively small too, and while apparently the color gamut is not the best, that either doesn't matter or isn't even apparent to me (in case you saw reviews criticizing this). Maybe if you're in graphic design, this might matter, though. The hinge is strong, and can bend all the way to 180 degrees. It's not a touchscreen laptop, but there are some uses, such as watching a video in bed or something. The system is also really slim for a gaming laptop, and easy to carry around, which is an excellent design choice.<br/><br/>The build quality isn't the best, being mostly plastic, but it is still smooth to feel, so there is at least that. The keyboard isn't very clicky, and the travel distance is a little small. It takes a while to get used to, but eventually you may get used to it. The backlit keyboard is nice, though. The trackpad unfortunately uses garbage Synaptics drivers. I played around with the registry a bit to add a couple gestures, but coming from Windows Precision, the trackpad is definitely a massive downgrade from Precision for me. I tried installing Precision drivers, and they worked (excellently, I might add) temporarily, because I guess Windows update has something in place to really latch you on to Synaptics drivers.<br/><br/>Although there are definitely some sacrifices made (including some that I haven't mentioned, such as needing to buy a separate cable if you want to add a hard drive or having only one slot for RAM), I think that on balance this laptop provides fantastic value for $680. In some areas you get what you pay for, but for $680 this laptop can do a lot more than others.</span>

<span>For 979, this didn't seem like a bad deal with an I7 and 1660TI. But there are some issue I must take up here, firstly, the screws that came installed here were put in WAY too tight for a machine that was built to be upgraded in the future. Tried to Crack it open just to upgrade with a 16 gig I had lying around and decided to leave it be after completely stripping a screw, secondly, the screen has a weird "bubble" look, almost as if the polarized lens isn't seated properly. Thirdly, the black trim around the screen itself has some notable chipping, prominently around the upper left corner of the screen. I do have some solutions for the mentioned issues. For the bottom screws, just make sure you have nice tools to begin with, then insert them FINGER TIGHT. For the screen, try using a suction cup on the front of the screen while pulling slightly, this will remove most of the "air bubbles" you may see. Thirdly, for the paint defect on the bezel, if you have the skill, I'd highly recommend using some flat black vinyl wrap on the bezel, it's thin enough to close properly and matches the black of the keys very well.</span>

<span>Let me just say, when you read reviews and you see "it came damaged...boo hoo"....It broke after 4 hours....boo hoo"....please just  blow past those reviews. My god, contact Amazon and get it replaced. It is so few and far between....AHHHH Those are worthless reviews about shipping....not about the product itself.<br/><br/>This laptop by XPG and Intel...is....I....my god...I don't even know what to say. I live on a budget like everyone else. I was looking for months for something that could handle VR and play any game I threw at it for less than "They want how much???" I play games like Metro Exodus and Cyber Punk 2077 and Microsoft flight sim 2020....Half Life Alyx...Skyrim VR....This Laptop handles them all. Now I don't claim that it can handle 4k on a huge screen because I have yet to try that. This is a laptop....Think travel and FUN! Oh and if you have a VR Oculus....I use Rift S.....A simple thunderbolt to display port adapter is all you need and it runs them very well. A few minor tweaks here and there like most pc graphics cards using VR (and this laptop does a great job at virtual reality gaming...just to spell it out...it RUNS VR! if you are wondering). I always push my systems to the max and see what they can handle. I played Shadow of the Tomb Raider at Ultra with Ray tracing enabled on this, my average FPS was high 40's. That's right, freakin Ray Tracing on a 4lbs laptop....WHAAAAT!??<br/><br/>Bottom line is, it is sweet for the price, Keep in mind XPG (ADATA) is new to the laptop world and they are no stranger to high quality products. So The price is awesome...for now..it is easily comparable to $2000 laptops.  DO NOT waist your time with the 1660TI it is old news and not worth the money. Get the 2070 Max Q version.<br/><br/>So what's the downsides.......uhm........Ok so, the onboard speakers sound like they are underwater...or just very drowned out since they are on the bottom of the laptop.."Headphones my friend...headphones" or just connect it to your bluetooth soundbar. There are a lot of options for sound,<br/><br/>Next: the fans spool up to a pretty high rpm when you are gaming, you will hear it. for sure, I'm talking about intense games, not so bad with lower quality graphic games like...let's say, Starcraft 2 or Diablo 3. Worst case, get a laptop cooler, and remember it is a GAMING laptop. Otherwise for general use, it is much more quiet than the crickets outside....or snoring.....just...it's quiet OK!<br/><br/>Next: Battery will not last long while gaming, like...2 hours....plug it in if you are gaming....I mean for long sessions, if you are just casually gaming or just unplugged,.....set it to battery saver mode....click the battery icon, bottom right of the screen, select battery saver, also next to the power button (top right of the keyboard right under the monitor) there is a second button to select, "Performance", "Balanced" or "Battery Saver". So no excuses, it will last your typical laptop battery life for gaming. All subject to change...Turn off the RGB lights, darken the screen....use battery saver. My 2 hour battery life is based on, performance mode with max brightness and the keyboard and front RGB lights all on high, playing Tomb Raider on battery. (living room A/C set to 72degrees)<br/><br/>Conclusion....Buy it...forget Alienware....and all the overpriced NAME brand crap. This is your new name brand. Besides the SSD and Memory in those overpriced name brand laptops are most likely ADATA anyways.<br/><br/>OH and PS the complaints about the keyboard being loud,,,,Well I am writing this in a very quiet bedroom next to my girlfriend who is sleeping, mind you....and a very light sleeper....I had the speakers set at volume 5 while playing diablo 3 and she couldn't sleep.....turn off the volume....keys clicking away and she is snoring away. So NO! the keyboard is very nice and comfortable and probably the best I have ever felt on a laptop.<br/><br/>You would do yourself a favor to buy this one before it becomes the next BIG thing. Also it is super discrete if you are a college student who needs it for class and doesn't want to draw attention but is a secret gaming nerd or, the serious Business guy who has a very important power point presentation to show on 6 monitors and forgets to turn off his game first......DOH!<br/><br/>Just buy it and say Thank you. You'll like this one.</span>

<span>Impressive.

<span>This is an insanely good laptop for the price! Benchmark was solid for a mid tier gaming system (Battle Cruiser) the keyboard is excellent. The only thing I am a little bothered about is that the keyboard backlight is only white and I had switched to this for the better specs ) from a lower spec legion 5,  and didn't realize that the legion 5 had any laptops without the rgb backlight. Maybe specify in the description that it is white backlight only. In the end that really doesn't matter as this is a monster of a laptop performance wise but if the colors are important to you make sure you pick the right one. Overall though, I am very happy with this laptop!</span>
