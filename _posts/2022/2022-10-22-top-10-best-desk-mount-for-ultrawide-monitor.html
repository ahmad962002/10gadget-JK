<span>Love this arm.  Hold my 49" monitor great.  But after I installed it, it didn't want to hold the monitor up.  The monitor, being heavy, wouldn't stay where I put it, it wanted to drop to the desk.  It wasn't until I did an internet search and found a YouTube video that I realized there is a hidden screw you tighten that makes the arm joint stiffer, so it will hold up the weight of the monitor and doesn't lower after you adjust it and let go.  This screw/adjustment is not mentioned in the instructions.  Major goof up by the company, as it ends up being the most important thing you need to know about using this arm.  I wonder how many of these were returned as "Doesn't work as advertised" all because of this one omission...  But now I love this thing, since I figured out how to adjust it!</span>

<span>This is a good stand, a great one even. The Samsung G9 is a beast of a monitor and many arms crumble beneath its weight. I've owned four different monitor arms at this point, and this is the sturdiest of any of them. It's the only one that confidently holds the monitor steady while allowing (mostly) easy adjustment.<br/><br/>For comparison, I purchased this to replace a Wali brand heavy duty arm that broke after a year of use (pitch tilt tension gave out). The Wali worked until it didn't but was wobbly, struggled to maintain the height adjustment, and complained when moved. This arm does not have any of those issues so far.<br/><br/>However, the price tag of $379 demands perfection. These are the drawbacks of this monitor arm:<br/>- The top arm is longer than the bottom arm, meaning the monitor is only centered at a specific distance and you will need disconnect the monitor, and move the base over after finding your preferred positioning.<br/>- The roll rotation of the monitor is not consistent as the yaw changes. There's a screw you can use to lock the roll of the monitor, but this becomes useless because the monitor will not be level if not fully extended.<br/>- The max height of the arm is not very tall, at maximum height the arm is 15" from the monitor plate to the desk, which puts the G9 10" above the desk. The Wali was 4-5" taller than this. This is the largest issue for me personally- the entire reason I use monitor arms is to have an ergonomic setup that won't cause back problems.<br/>- The plastic plate for the cable management on the bottom arm section is flimsy and refuses to stay put at the slightest pressure.<br/><br/>In conclusion, there are some silly issues with this arm, but it's the only one that is strong enough for the G9 monitor, so there's no other options. It is very sturdy though.</span>

<span>Used for my Samsung Odyssey G9 like everyone else. Initially tried to save money with the $100 VIVO and the head pivot was not sturdy enough to hold the weight of the monitor. I am not a super strong person and was able to position the mount low enough and slid my monitor into place myself. No complaints.Overpriced but gets the job done and is super sturdy,not</span>

<span> UPDATED REVIEW:<br/><br/>I purchased the Ergotron HX 6 months ago and discovered that the tilter lacked the lift strength to hold up the monitor. I opened a ticket with their support team, and a few months later they worked with me on getting a replacement tilter. It works great! The new tilter is plenty strong for my particularly heavy monitor.<br/><br/>They also fixed an issue with the instructions, where the instructions didn't tell you which way to tighten a particular screw to increase/decrease tilter strength. So, kudos to them.<br/><br/>I've been very impressed by the level of the support from Ergotron here. They constantly kept in touch with me about my issue. I am definitely a Ergotron fan at this point.<br/><br/>I will say that my original review's criticism of the mounting process is STILL TRUE. That is one area Ergotron should iterate on.<br/><br/>Anyway, if you're looking for a great heavy duty monitor arm, you've found it!<br/><br/>I'll keep the old review here for posterity.<br/><br/>OLD REVIEW:<br/><br/>Titled: "It doesn't hold up"<br/><br/>The HX lacks the tilt lift strength to hold up up my monitor, an Odyssey G9, which is 14 Kg and well within specifications. It is essentially stuck in a 5 degree downward angle, unless I prop it up.<br/><br/>Other issues:<br/>- The instructions don't say which way to turn the included T-wrench to increase or decrease the tilt lift strength! Incredible. (This is noted on all the other adjustments in the instructions, besides this one.) You'll either have to look up external resources to find out, or just experiment (possibly in vain, like me!)<br/>- This was the most painful mounting of my life. Like other mount systems, you install an adapter on the back of your monitor, and then you mount your adapter-plus-monitor onto the stand. Usually the port to mount the adapter has an ergonomic shape which makes mounting a breeze. But not this one. The target port on the stand is very small and hard to mount onto. Plus you'll either need to mount the monitor holding it at a 70 degree angle, or you'll have to press down on the spring mechanism to hold it down while mounting it. This requires a lot of hands, and difficult to do solo, especially while holding a 14kg monitor.<br/><br/>It took me two hours to assemble and mount my monitor, and then it doesn't even hold up the monitor.<br/><br/>I opened up a chat with support, which to their credit they answered up right away. However, they weren't able to commit right there to sending me a new replacement adapter (it's labeled "A1" in the instructions). They said they'll talk to their tech team and mail me back. If they send me a nice replacement I may adjust my review. Otherwise I'll just send the whole thing back to amazon and try again with a different mount.</span>

<span>I bought this lever system for my Samsung beast of a G9 back in Sept. and did a trial run of an install a week ago.<br/><br/>Everything was shipped very sturdily and easily marked when unboxed. I went with a Youtube video install from an owner since I'm more visual than parsing written instructions.<br/><br/>My main issue: The adapter that comes with it (sort of like a metal cup that is held onto the back hole of the GP monitor with 4 small screws to the main plate) has a notch that slides under the plastic notch of the monitor. This is not very secure and slides out so all the weight of the system is on those 4 smaller screws.<br/><br/>When I did the install I saw that the 2 of the 4 hand tightening screws on the main plate (larger, separate on the exterior plate from the 4 smaller interior screws) were angling off the plate worryingly and I mistakenly thought it was coming off so I hastily popped the monitor back off and broke the brass interior slot ring.<br/><br/>Looking at other Youtube install videos it seems that is a known factor and owners are ok with that stress on the 4 interior screws if the plate is not notch perfect. *shrug*.<br/><br/>So I emailed Ergotron to see if I can get a replacement part for the arm to try again. To my delight, their customer service replied quickly and shipped UPS the part for free. Major kudos.<br/><br/>CONCLUSION: Going to go at it again when the part comes in. I think it'll be fine now even though the back plate skewing a little bit is head scratching. 4 Stars for the product. 5 stars for Customer Service.<br/><br/>I might come back to this review down the road after a year for an update of how it all went.</span>

<span>This monitor arm is extremely well made, durable and a lot more heavy then I thought it would be.  So, overall the construction of the arm and it's design is very well made, heavy solid materials.  It comes shipped in a great packaging, it's nice to see care in how much care went into packing.  The assembly is relatively easy with just 3 parts that connect with a few screws to tighten.  I'm using this arm with an LG 38" Ultra Wide monitor that I believe is about 15lbs in weight and it can easily move around without struggle on the arm.<br/><br/>If you have a lighter monitor or a smaller sized one, you may have difficulty with the arm keeping a monitor in a low position.  If the monitor is light weight &lt; 12-13lbs it may want to lift up on it's own due to the heavy spring action.  I had a smaller monitor on it while waiting for my ultra-wide and it was kind of comical.  I added weight to the monitor to keep it down a bit.<br/><br/>It supports VESA 100x100 and 200x200 on the mounting bracket.  I feel like this is a good standard for newer monitors.  The mount is sturdy and supports a really good range of movement tilting up and down as well as a full rotation on it's side.  The arm movement is really reasonable in it's range of movement.  I'm even able to drop my monitor down a bit lower than the clamp.<br/><br/>The arm assembly also includes options to mount the arm with a desk clamp, or through a drilled hole.  It has good options for mounting the arm as needed.<br/><br/>I'm really satisfied with this purchase and can see this arm lasting a really long time - probably much longer than my new monitor.  I highly recommend getting it.</span>

<span>I had reservations of any mount that was not drilled in to the desktop, in holding my 49 inch monitor.  However, I have found that this mount not only securely holds this heavy monitor, but also does a phenomenal job of holding every adjustment that I make to it in terms of height, etc.  It is expensive, but having lost my last "gaming" monitor to a bad mount, I have no problem spending the extra money to ensure that does not happen again.<br/><br/>The built in cable management is nice, but I have enough cables, and thick HDMI cables coming out of it that kept popping the cover off of the arm.  So, I wrapped the cables and that part just hangs.  This is not a big deal to me because the mount accomplishes the desired task, but may be annoying to others.</span>

<span>I was a little worried about the bad reviews, but this desk mount turned out to be absolutely fantastic! It's super sturdy and has no trouble with my LG 4K 32" monitor that's pretty hefty. It's very easy to assemble and comes with all the hardware you need to attach your VESA 100x100 monitor (or 75x75).<br/>The VESA bracket simply slides onto the end of the arm and is secured by a solid thumbscrew.<br/><br/>The arm comes with the two sizes of Allen wrenches needed and they can be stored on the cable holder that clips on the vertical rod. You need to use the large one to adjust the tension in a couple of joints to match the weight of your monitor, so that it stays where you want it.<br/><br/>I can't say enough good things about this monitor arm. It frees up a lot of space on my desk, allows me to adjust my monitor perfectly so that it's at the right height and distance from my face, it's super sturdy, and I was able to install it in under 10 minutes -- and the price is ridiculously low for such a well made product.<br/><br/>Highly recommended.</span>

<span>I finally after a couple years decided to redo my setup for functionality and even to spruce things up a bit without spending too much money. I bought this mount for less than $30, and I must say you get what you pay for and I learned that quickly with this mount.<br/>My biggest issue is the side to side tilt, because it really doesn't do that. As a software developer I need a mount that can move around as I sit in different positions to see the screen, and this one moves but the tilt is so stiff and feels like I'm going to break the monitor when I try to.<br/>The mount overall is decent, a bit springy at times moving up or down but it's sturdy and not flimsy. If anything its the opposite.<br/>The wrap things up, if you're planning to move the monitor around quite a bit maybe splurge $20 more for something less cheap, and smoother. If you just want a mount for your monitor then here you go, a mount for your monitor. Yes, a mount.</span>

<span>I’ve bought one of the retuned ones, for cheaper. All parts were present.<br/><br/>Overall it’s a decent deal. It hold 32 inch 4K HDR screen just fine.  it is counterintuitive, but to increase lifting power the power lift screw must be unscrewed, when it fully screwed in till the stop - lift power will be weakest. Yes lift needs to be adjusted to match your actual screen weight.<br/><br/>Be careful with vertical angle. Vertical angle better set once for the best one for you and do not change afterwards, more. Vertical angle hinge may get loose it twisted all the time and screen may just start flipping down, but it’s common for all budget mounts, so do not worry too much. I move screen all the other ways all the time — turn horizontally, make higher, lower, shift from one side of table to another, just don’t mess with vertical angle too much and this thing will last.<br/><br/>It’s my second monitor hand and previous one seems a bit better in terms of parts sturdiness, but I’m sure that this one will hold just fine.</span>

<span>I bought this to hold my 49" Samsung G9 monitor.  When I first connected it, things went well, but I had to shift the monitor a bit and suddenly the 'ball' connector started to slip.  The instructions say to retighten it, so I tried that, but as I tried tightening, the inner plastic thing that holds the nut would spin as well, so there was no option to tighten.  If they can get more friction between the powder-coated steel and the  smooth plastic, then it would hold very well.<br/>I am upgrading the rating some- after playing with the mount, I managed to remove the bolt, and a small blue plastic insert in the nut that was probably meant to keep the bolt from coming loose, but made it impossible to tighten the mount properly.  I haven't reinstalled the mount yet, but based on some tests I did, this will hold now.<br/>Changed back to 3- The ball mount can now be tightened enough, and it holds the monitor, but getting the monitor adjusted correctly is almost impossible.  I have to keep taking the monitor off, loosening the ball mount, moving it (making sure its perfectly level) then re attaching it to get the monitor verticle.  I am afraid if I adjust it too much more, I will damage the monitor.  As it is, the monitor is angled downward which would be ok if I was 2 feet shorter.</span>

<span>We love these monitor stands.  I searched for all options and selected this one because the distance between the two mounts was the largest I found, so I ordered one.  I was impressed with the quality, and the cable management, so I ordered three more so all of our desks in the office match.  On the second order one of the connections was stripped and would not tighten.  The company was great to deal with and quickly sent a replacement part.  I highly recommend this product.

<span>Used on my ultrawide monitor. Is well built compared to similar stands. However, the monitor is quite heavy and cannot complete support it’s weight at any height (16lbs).<br/><br/>For most monitors this would be perfect; for ultrawide, look elsewhere.</span>

<span>Solid, well constructed. Holds my 32" monitor with no problems.  Range is slightly limited with a gant monitor but it still does its job well and doesnt sag.  Have bought two in the past year and they hold up against everyday wear and tear with no problems.</span>

<span>This product was fairly easy to install. I had an issue finding one of the screws but when I called Ergotron support they were helpful. I installed the monitor arm on my Varidesk with the clamp and it was easy. I then attached my samsung monitor to the arm. Installation took me about 30 mins and no issues so far. I highly recommend watching YT videos where there is a ton of information.<br/><br/>The arm itself has a good range of motion and is can fit in any area. I recommend this product.</span>

<span>This thing is great.  It's tall, sturdy, easy to put together, and simple to adjust.  It includes thumbscrews for the VESA mount, which was a nice bonus.<br/><br/>I had to return the arm because I had an issue with the monitor I was going to use, so I had to swap into a monitor that was too heavy for this arm -- but that's not the arm's fault.  For the week I had it, it worked great.</span>

<span>Wanted a laptop to be the adjacent screen in a fual monitor setup and bought this to go along with thr wali monitor arms (gorgeous two of those arms - one for a hpx32 and the other to be flexible with a laptop mount to juggle between work and personal laptops). This works well and is very sturdy.<br/><br/>Only small change I want in thr design is the lower two arms holding thr laptop should have deeper rubber gaskets protecting the laptop edges. Though I have not seen any possible damage, the fit and finish did worry me a bit. I have now wrapped some electrical tape around it to have some peace of mind. But 5 stars to the product.</span>

<span>I love this product. It totally changes the use of your desktop and ability to to put your monitor in the perfect position for your eyes. My husband and I share an 8 foot desk, each using half, and these mounts made a huge difference in the amount of usable desktop space we have. Easy to setup and you can fully control the range and ease of movement for your monitor. 100% worth it!</span>

<span>Just bought this monitor arm. The review sites say this one is the one to get. I can't disagree. For the price, it does hold my 32 inch monitor fine. I can move it around all kinds of ways. It kinda cool. I do wish the post was taller so I could raise the monitor higher. So, if you need to put your monitor above another one, this one is too short for that. Otherwise, it's good value.</span>

<span>This Amazon Basics monitor arm was noticeably less expensive than a very similar monitor arm that I purchased from another vendor. The other unit has a taller support pole and is a bit more polished looking, but otherwise both units are comparable in design and function. Both arms are very sturdy and exceed my expectations in turns of weight capacity, installation flexibility, ease of installation, and adjustment flexibility/range of motion. The fact that the Amazon Basics arm saved me a little bit of money with no apparent sacrifices makes it a great overall value and a very nice addition to my multi-monitor computer setup.</span>
