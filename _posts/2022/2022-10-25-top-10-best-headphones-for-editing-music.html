<span>don't let anyone tell you that these are overhyped. I have had these for almost a year now, and these were the first decent quality headphones, I was blown away by the level of detail that I had been missing my entire life, I initially paired this with a Fiio e10k, and that was my foot into the door, I knew there had to be much better stuff out there, and you know, after trying different Sennheiser's, Hifiman, Sony, Philips, several iems of different brands, I still use these old cans about 95% of the time I use headphones, they fulfill all my audio needs throughout the day just fine, I think the coiled cable is perfect, I wish all my headphones had the option of a coiled cable like this, one thing you will have to keep in mind, is order an extra set of pads, they don't have to be $80 leather pads, I just got mine directly from Beyerdynamic, the basic velour, in black of course. this was honestly the best $150 I have ever spent, experiencing these headphones for the first time, I could only describe that blissful ignorance as, whereas I was blind, now I see.</span>

<span>Well, I once hated headphones but these phones are changing my mind.<br/><br/>Why did I hate headphones?<br/><br/>First of all, headphones are uncomfortable.  They're heavy, hot and clamp your head like a vise.  These are none of the above.  The DT-990 Pro 250 is light in weight with soft velour ear cups.  Since they don't have plastic ear cups that induce sweating, they don't feel hot.  The headband is tight enough but not too tight on my head (hat size 7 1/2).  It's a bit astonishing to me that these headphones feel as good as they do.<br/><br/>Another reason I hated headphones was the boxy sound that seems to emanate from the center of my skull.  A bit of research indicated to me that this condition is more likely to occur when using closed back headphones.  The DT-990 Pro 250 is an open back design.  The soundstage is broad.  Maybe not as broad as listening in a well laid-out room with precisely placed and designed speakers but the soundstage is open and broad enough for me to distinguish individual musical instruments and their position in reference to the overall musical program.  Again, I'm astonished at the openness of the sound field.<br/><br/>Finally, I hated headphones for the reason many others like them--the isolation involved.  I know there are other types of headphones available today that allow outside sounds to be heard but the only phones I had ever used in the past were those that tried to shut me off from the outside world.  Sometimes, being isolated is good.  But I prefer to be aware of what's happening around me.  The DT-990 Pro 250 headphones allow in enough environmental sounds to keep me connected but not enough to be distracting.  I want to know if the phone rings, someone knocks at the door, the dog barks or Mr. Murderous Home Invader is coming through the bedroom window.<br/><br/>I've only had these headphones for one day.  From what I've read on Amazon and on other websites, the sound of these phones will improve as they "burn in".  I've witnessed this sound improvement with time and use happening with stereo speaker systems and with two SACD players so I know it's possible.  But even without the break-in period, the DT-990 phones sound good to me.  Some reviewers complain of the mid-bass being overly boosted and the treble being too prominent.  I don't have golden ears but I don't find these characteristics present.  The design of the phones does color the musical programming somewhat but, in my opinion, this adds a little punch without going so far as to be obtrusive.<br/><br/>When the UPS guy delivered my package yesterday, I was listening to John Hiatt's "Dirty Jeans and Mudslide Hymns" CD.  It has typical bass heavy production, however, the headphones never sounded boomy at all and I could pick up details in the recording I had never noticed.  Since classical music is where I listen most closely, I then put on the RCA Living Stereo SACD of the Boston Pops doing "Gaite Parisenne".  There's lots of high frequency sounds on this recording but I never noticed any irritating, piercing treble out of the headphones.  Next I played another RCA Living Stereo SACD, Fritz Reiner conducting the Chicago Symphony in Dvorak's Symphony No. 9.  This is a superb full orchestra recording.  Again, I felt astonished at the details coming out in this CD through these headphones.  Today, I've listened to selections from Arthur Rubenstein's Chopin CD box set and Martha Argerich's EMI concerto box set.  The phones can pick up too much detail at times--I could detect foot tapping and breathing during one of the live Argerich performances.  But the pianos always sound natural, lively and forward if slightly lacking in warmth at times.  I expect "warmth" will develop with continued use.  I've also plugged the DT-990's into my Kindle Fire HD tablet and listened to parts of the MP3 of Nicola Benedetti's "Fantasie" compilation.  I know many feel MP3 is not true high fidelity, inferior to other downloadable formats as well as CDs.  Still, it's the direction recorded music is headed today and it can be entirely satisfying and enjoyable, especially when one listens with the DT-990s.  Ms. Benedetti's "Lark Ascending" sounds every bit as good to me on the MP3 through these headphones as it does from the original CD played over my B&amp;W home speakers.<br/><br/>Time will tell and many things can occur.  If I can remember, I will update this review over time with more on how these phones break in and how they perform long term.<br/><br/>UPDATE, July 6, 2013:<br/><br/>Well, those who said the phones would "burn in" knew what they were talking about.  I've barely used my home speakers since taking possession of these headphones in May and the sound has improved significantly.  They have definitely developed that "warmth" I was hoping for.  I enjoy listening to music more every time I use them.<br/><br/>There is one point I do dislike about these phones after extended use and familiarity with them.  They are not very aesthetically pleasing to my eye.  The brown plastic grid and white lettering on the exterior ear pieces of the Pro model really look kind of cheap and Mickey Mouse.  I guess it's a style that some might like but I'm not exactly joyous about it.  The other DT-990 models look a lot better, however, they cost considerably more and they are said to sound the same.  For the price difference, I would still buy the Pro model.  Can't see them when I'm wearing them anyway.</span>

<span>*UPDATE*<br/>As promised, I wanted to come back and let you all know what I thought of these cans after some burn-in.  I didn't use white noise or anything special.  I just left my cans connected to my AMP playing music from my computer on random at high volume.  When I went to work or sleep, I would leave these playing.  So....drumroll:  did the burn-in make any difference?  YES!  A resounding YES!  As you read on to my original review, you will know that I love crisp clear highs.  But even for me, these headphones were a bit fatiguing initially.  There was a bit of a "shattering" effect from the highs.  Which I really like, but can tire your ears out very quickly.  After about 300 hours of burn-in, these cans have really hit their stride.  The highs are still EXCEPTIONALLY clear.  I can still hear the squeak when a finger drags over a fret.  I can still hear every string during an acoustic strum.  The softening of the highs didn't steal anything from the clarity.  The burn-in allows me to listen for a couple of hours without aural fatigue.<br/><br/>Also, I've had a chance to use these cans using a multitude of amps.  They sound fabulous using my Yamaha speaker amp/receiver.  They sound great using a good headphone amp.  Fiios E17 or E7/9 is probably the minimum I'd recommend.  In a nutshell, these things are thirsty for power.  And although they sound good without proper amperage, these cans scale beautifully when provided juice.  In a nutshell, these cans thirst power, and the more you give it, the more these cans respond.  Please consider this when purchasing.  If you don't have a dac/amp setup or a speaker receiver with a good headphonen port, then make sure you budget for it...or plan to purchase one down the road.  An already 5 star review has now become a 5 star review with an exclamation mark.  ENJOY!<br/><br/>*ORIGINAL REVIEW*<br/>I just received these headphones today, so keep in mind that these cans haven't been burned in yet.  Generally a high end headphone requires about 100+ hours to burn in properly.  John Grado of Grado headphones says 50 hours is a good burn in time.  Others say the AKG 701/702 require about 300 hours to burn in properly.  But 100 hours is widely held as the norm.  I was going to wait to write the review, but they sounded so good right out of the box that I couldn't wait to write a review.  I will update after about 6 months of use, so come back if this review doesn't convince you to "add to cart".  I'll see if these headphones have a tonal softening after some burn in.<br/><br/>What's in the package:  Nothing but the headphones.  You get the headphones with the 3.5mm jack and 1/4" screw on adapter.  Both ends are gold plated.<br/><br/>Okay, now that I've got that over with, I'll get to the meat and bones of the review, the sound--and how glorious they sound.  I figured the best way to test the dynamic range and audio quality of the music was to pick a handful of songs that highlight a certain instrument or frequency range.  So I'll reflect on my impressions from the various songs I chose to test out the fidelity of these headphones.<br/><br/>Billy Jean(Michael Jackson) - Michael Jackson stated that he wanted to write a song with a great bass-line, and into the studio he went with Quincy Jones.  The product of this inspiration and the collaboration was Billy Jean.  The quintessential MJ song.  I chose this song specifically to test the clarity of the lower freqs.  WOW.  The bass is deep and clear.  Each bass note has it's own presence.  The notes don't slur/blend into each other.  There is a discernible transition from note to note.  EXACTLY what I was hoping for.<br/><br/>Getting in Tune(The Who) - Subjectively speaking, I think John Entwistle was the greatest bassist of all time.  To test the speed of the bass, I chose this song because no one played the bass quite like Mr. Entwistle.  Whereas Billy Jean is a slow bass-rift, Getting in Tune is classic John Entwistle and the bass notes fly all over the place rapidly.  These cans keep up with the amazing fingers of John Entwistle without breaking a sweat.  And as was the case with Billy Jean, each note has its own distinct presence.  Open headphones usually aren't the best for exhibiting the lower freqs, but these are amazing.<br/><br/>In the Air Tonight(Phil Collins) - I wanted to see how these cans handled drums.  And if you want to go to drums, what is better than the opening drum rift in this song?  Does it have the anger of a John Bonham or the craziness of Keith Moon?  No, but it has the unrivaled coolness.  Drums are a dynamic instrument tha covers almost the entire frequency gamut.  So Drums are actually one of the best instruments to test a set of cans.  Like everything else I've heard through these things, the drums are AMAZING.  From the banging of the sticks, to the stomp of the bass drum, and the crash of the hi-hat these cans magically reproduce the energy that Phil Collins brings to this song.<br/><br/>Leather and Lace(Stevie Nicks &amp; Don Henley) - I chose this song for two reasons: the vocal mastery of the two singers; and the amazing acoustic guitar play.  With a lot of lesser cans, Stevie Nicks young voice comes off squeaky.  With these, the multiple layers of her brilliant voice all comes through.  The youthful highs and the textured lows of her voice are all on display.  Don Henley's raspy highs are depicted with amazing honesty.  This song is perfect for highlighting two very distinct singing styles.  And when they harmonize?  you can cleary hear each singer distinct from the other.  The acoustic guitar is just unbelievable through these cans.  I can hear every string from each strum of the pick.  Often times a strum will sound like 1 note, but I can actually hear all 6 strings separately.  If you never heard this effect before, you are missing out.<br/><br/>Mr. Know It All(Kelly Clarkson) - I picked this song because Kelly Clarkson has one of the best voices going today, and because it is a modern pop/rock song with modern production value.  Whereas the other songs kept gaps in the frequency range, this song presents a wall of music effect.  By this, I mean that almost the entire frequency range is ALWAYS present.  The bass-line isn't as distinctive as was the case with Billy Jean and Getting in Tune, but that is such the way of newer songs.  The bass-line is a ever-present steamroller.  Now this isn't a bad thing.  These cans allow the bass to maintain its ever-presence while still allowing the mid-range and highs to co-exist.  Kelly Clarkson's powerful voice doesn't get drowned out.  With amazing clarity, every layer, every tone, every break in her voice sound AMAZING.<br/><br/>Piano Concerto No. 1(Tchaikovsky - performed by Ivo Pogorelich) - This is my favorite classical piece.  This is also my favorite rendition of this piece.  Ivo Pogorelich takes a lot of artistic freedom in his interpretations, and this song is no exception.  His piano performance is imperfectly perfect.  I know that's an oxy-moron, but because he chooses to play it the way he feels, the emotional impact to the listener is that much greater.  So you can imagine my disappointment when this version of the song was unbearable with these cans.  I am a bit torn when it comes to hi-fidelity and classical music.  You almost ALWAYS get static.  I don't care whether you have a HD-audio or FLAC copy, it is the nature of the recording methods.  The best performances are usually live, and you are going to get static in a live recording environment.  So although every instrument is distinct and the sound-stage vast, the static is just too much of a distraction.  The better the headphones or speakers, the more static you will get.  So I was forced to play a different version of the same piece--the Martha Argerich version which has a lot less static.  Her rendition is textbook.  She plays it as Tchaikovsky wrote it.  She is technically one of the finest pianists EVER.  This version has a lot less static, but there still is static nonetheless.  This version allowed me to focus a bit more on the instruments.  When someone hammers the ivory, often times you will hear the reverberations and echo inside the piano box.  And these are the first cans I've listened to that reproduce this effect as realistically.  You can hear the horse hairs sliding across the strings.  Just an amazing set of cans for classical music, but you have to make sure you have the best recordings or else the static will ruin your listening experience.  This is no gig on the cans, it is a gig on the recording methods.  So you may not be able to enjoy your favorite pieces unless you find a flawless version of it.  I would say about 90% of my classical collection is adversely effected by the poor recordings and are thus rendered unlistenable with these cans ability to reveal every flaw.<br/><br/>Hate it or Love it (50 Cent - G UNIT version) - I love this song.  And you can't do a current headphone review without including a hip-hop song.  So why not pick my favorite?  A good set of hip-hop cans will get your head bobbing and your fingers snapping.  You won't even realize you are doing this.  It's why hip-hop is such a good genre of music for clubs.  These headphones are almost too precise for hip-hop.  I am so amazed by how great they sound, I find myself listening to the intricacies of every note that I don't find myself bobbing and weaving.  If headphones can be too good for hip-hop, these are them.  The precision distracts from the vibe that is so important to hip-hop.  The same thing happened when I tried a few other hip-hop songs like Hot Revolver by Lil' Wayne,  The Way I Are by Timbaland, and Diamonds from Sierra Leone by Kanye West.  Maybe over time I will get used to the precision and won't get distracted, but presently, I'm not sure I'd choose these headphones for hip-hop.  Stereo Hearts by Gym Class Heroes and Without You by David Guetta don't suffer the same fate.  These songs don't rely on bass as much as the other songs.  And as such, they are fantastic for listening to with these cans.  But these two songs aren't so much as hip-hop.  They are more dance-pop songs.<br/><br/>There are so many other songs I'd like to cover like Sweet Child o' Mine, Crazy Train, any live Clapton, anything David Bowie, Al Green, Marvin Gaye, Marley's Redemption Song, Journey, Annie Lennox, Foo Fighters, Collective Soul, Linkin Park and so many more.  But I think I'll let you discover that for yourselves.  I have never listened to a set of headphones that rival these.  I've always leaned towards precision from my Hi-Fi equipment.  Maybe it's because I grew up playing instruments growing up, but I love hearing the instruments and voices in all their flawed glory.  I love hearing a break in a voice, the strum of an acoustic, and the clatter of a hi-hat.  These cans are truly for the sound-purist.  What an amazing bargain at ~$200.  Imagine what they will sound after 300 hours?  I know...I can't wait to find out.  If you want to find out more about these headphones, post a comment and I'll be sure to reply.</span>

<span>My qualifications: good ears. I am NOT an electrical engineer, audio engineer, expert or wealthy audiophile. I AM an experienced audio technician and someone who enjoys quality sound design in media.<br/><br/>I've personally owned AKG K240 open backs, and Audio-Technica ATH-M50/M30/M20 closed backs. I've also used many other headphones from Sony, DT, AT, AKG, Sennheiser etc over the years, and sold them in my capacity working for a dealer.<br/><br/>These DT 990s are all around great cans. I have the 250 ohm and I'm driving them with a Focusrite 18i20 interface. If you order the 250 ohm, you will want a headphone amp to drive them. Doesn't have to be crazy expensive unless you want it to be - $30 or 40 from any reputable brand.<br/><br/>Pros:<br/>+ Plush velour pads, high build quality, comfy headband for my big skull, good looking<br/>+ A high end that can be described only as "silky", and a very tight, springy low end<br/>+ Extremely detailed and spacious sounding due to open back design and quality of drivers<br/>+ Non-fatiguing midrange<br/>+ The frequency response feels, to my ears, somewhat less analytical and more musical than the M50s<br/>+ At this price point we're firmly into "not cheap" territory, and these outperform more expensive cans<br/><br/>Cons:<br/>- No detachable cable: if it breaks you need to disassemble it to repair the cans<br/>- Headband could actually be a little bigger for my big skull<br/><br/>They are open back headphones so sound leaks freely in and out. I would not use these INSTEAD OF closed back headphones; I would choose based on the situation - am I tracking, listening casually, mixing, on the bus, etc. If you have a box unit AC running in your window you will hear it through these. You will not hear it very much through M50s.<br/><br/>I have used the DT 770s and intended to buy them, but the 990s were on sale for $10 more so here we are. It's been a while since I used the 770s so I can't offer an A/B comparison but these are my favorite headphones I've ever used, so consider that my endorsement.</span>

<span>Amazing for listening to music unless you're expecting to hear a lot of bass. I have slightly above average ears and they just barely fit around my ears, so be careful if you have a large head. The cable is quite long and not detachable which gets in the way sometimes but is not usually an issue. I would buy this product again given the general comfort and great audio quality.</span>

<span>Very happy with these ATH-M20X headphones. I bought them to get a sample of what the ATH-M50X might generally sound like.  I prefer these to my Sennheiser HD 599 SE which cost 3x more. The ATH-M20X have the mids and to a certain extent the highs which are missing from the HD 599's. If you want to hear ALL the music these are for you. I love hearing accentuations I've never heard in recordings I've listened to many times before. If you like bass heavy don't buy these. They aren't lacking in bass, the just aren't bass heavy.</span>

<span>UPDATE, BUILD QUALITY:<br/><br/>Well, I'll be damned, its been exactly a year since I wrote this. It was pure luck that I checked my reviews today.<br/><br/>Anyway, build quality.<br/><br/>The M20xs I bought a year ago are still going strong, and I use them constantly when I am not on my computer. The cable is fine, the gold plating has worn off of the plug (that's normal after a lot of use), and the plastic doesn't appear to be worn. If I cleaned this thing very well, it would look brand new. However, not everything is in perfect condition, and that would be the padding.<br/><br/>I started to notice after a while that the earcups were starting to feel harder and harder. As a sanity check, I took a look at my dad's m50xs to see if they were still soft, and they were (he doesn't use them that much anymore). I looked into it, and apparently, the fake rubber-leather stuff Audio Technica uses in their earcups slowly deteriorates over time by getting harder and eventually cracking due to the stress of cushioning. This is a result of constant contact with body oils (this is why my dad's pair is still soft). Thankfully, these are replaceable, but they are $25 for a pair, which is quite a bit. I got these headphones for $30 dollars while they were on sale, for perspective. There is also the chance that they use some cheaper earcups in the m20xs, which wouldn't surprise me. In which case, the replacement earcups for the m50xs could be considered an upgrade.<br/><br/>What is more worrisome is the headband. Unlike the m50xs, which have a higher quality rubber on the headband, the headband on the m20xs is made out of the same material the earcups are. You can't replace it. Although its unlikely that the headband will get severely damaged from cracking since it doesn't exactly cushion, I can still see some dents in mine that don't go away.<br/><br/>Other than that, these are still my favorite general purpose headphones, and I still recommend them. I'm on the edge of replacing the earcups though. If it does break at some point, I might aim for the m40xs due to the shorter cable options, better build quality/materials, and better sound. I'll give it two more years and see what happens to them.<br/><br/>REVIEW:<br/><br/>So, I have never been wealthy enough to own a good pair of headphones. Hearing about the constant praise of Audio-Technica, I decided to pick of their budget pair of monitors, the ATH-M20x. My father has a pair of their M40x or 50x, but I am pretty much not allowed to touch them. That's why I can't say which ones they are.<br/><br/>As perspective and for comparison, the main headphones I used before these were the Sol-Republic v8 tracks, and I use a Logitech G230 gaming headset currently for my desktop.<br/><br/>The song I tested between these headphones was Ocean Man by Ween, because of the formidable range in pitch. I also remembered the song the day I did this, so it was a bit nostalgic for me to listen to it again.<br/><br/>SOUND QUALITY:<br/><br/>Now, the first thing that struck me with these headphones was that the bass was much less compared to the other headphones. Now, this isn't a bad thing, because it let me focus on the other tracks in the song, such as the guitar and percussion, which became much brighter. This made the song sound much clearer than my other headphones, which lacked a little in mids and highs.  My Sols overall had much more bass, but the rest of the frequencies seemed filtered out because of it. It's mostly the same story with my g230s, but the highs are much better than the sols. Realizing this, I finally figured out why I couldn't hear footsteps very well in the game Counter Strike Global Offensive, which encourages me to buy another pair of the M20x for my desktop, as well as a mic. The only real issue I have with the M20x at this point is that I cannot hear bass drums very well if they aren't mixed loud enough, which is disappointing, as percussion is one of the most important factors in music to me. Overall, these have generally amazing performance in the audio range, despite the bass seeming only a tad bit weaker than it should be. If they boosted up a tiny bit, I would be satisfied. Not worth to take a star off however, especially for the price.<br/><br/>Another thing to note is that these headphones are higher in impedance than normal, so I have to near max out my volume on my phone to get somewhere acceptable to me. This isn't a problem, but I'm afraid I may get some distortion in some songs. This is also sad, as I use a separate Creative Zen audio player for my high quality CD rips, which don't go as loud as my phone, making it essentially useless. They also don't really like to plug into my phone with the case on, so I have to jam it in the jack and hope it doesn't spring out. This is along with the other problem with my audio jack, which is that they always think I'm using an inline mic unless I unplug and re-plug and hope they see them as regular headphones. If it doesn't, then bumping the cord can cause google to start voice detecting, which is very annoying, as well as randomly pausing and playing a song. To reinforce it, this is a problem with my PHONE, not the plug. This is more of a me problem, however, they still have issues being plugged into a phone with a case. Making the end coned and the adapter it comes with internally coned would solve this problem.<br/><br/>BUILD QUALITY:<br/><br/>Now, one of main reasons why I bought a g230 was because they are very well built, and could take multiple falls off of my desk. Same goes for the Sols, which are pretty much designed like a tank due to the super strong headband and hard but not brittle plastic. The M20x however, seems like it would need a bit more care with the headband, since it is not topped with plastic. I usually just throw my Sols into my backpack everyday, because it can handle it. These will need a bit of extra attention to not tear up the foam on the headband. I tried buying a </span>
<a class="a-link-normal" data-hook="product-link-linked" href="/hard-case-from-Caseling/dp/B00LZ3VFW8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">hard case from Caseling</a>
<span>, but the description lied to me and said that these headphones would fit. They didn't, and now I have to return it as soon as possible to get my 13 bucks back. They do fit my dad's well though because they fold, and is a pretty good case. Otherwise, the ABS plastic is nice on the drivers making them strong, and the headband has spring steel metal in it. There are no visible defects anywhere, not even unmixed plastics or rough spots on the foam. This is fairly impressive for a product made in Taiwan. Another thing I would have liked would be to color the logo inset on the sides of the drivers, it would make it easier to see. I assume this is to differentiate different models.<br/><br/>Now, the cord I have a bit of an issue with. The cord itself is very nice; it's well insulated and flexible. The jack is nice too, it appears gold plated and has a nice bend protector. The issue I have is that it's way to freaking long, at a staggering 3 meters. This may be a good thing for some people, but I am going to be walking around with these. I have to coil up the wire (thank god for that insulation) and put a cable management strip on it to shorten it. Now, there is a good 4 inch diameter coil in my pocket that is 1/2 an inch thick, and is VERY annoying. If they could have at least shortened it to maybe 1 meter, I would not be writing this. This is worth a star for me, so off it goes. Despite this, the cable has to be one of the best impeding headphone cables I have encountered, keeping out eddy currents very well, which would cause distortion with the huge coil I have to lug around. A good way to test if a cable is well insulated or not is to try and use the cable as a stylus on a touch screen. If the screen reacts in any way while playing music, the cable has failed the test. No matter how I tried, looping it, squishing it against the screen, it would not be detected. That is a good sign for a good cable, as no electrical fields are going through that thing. As a solution to the coil, I may do some research on the internals of the cord, and shorten it myself. If you are also hateful of this issue, the better ATH models have interchangeable cables that can be much shorter. To me, it isn't worth it to pay 30 to 40 extra dollars for that feature.<br/><br/>COMFORT:<br/><br/>So, my g230s are a very comfortable pair of headphones for me to wear, as they are over ears. My Sols on the other hand are on ear, which was a huge issue to me when I bought them. It's not that they were uncomfortable, but it was because of an odd problem I have with my right ear. My ear canals are extremely small, so I can't use earbuds, which is really my main reason of buying full on headphones. In this case, the Sols would squeeze my right ear shut! There would be no music to my right ear unless I physically held the driver, and stretched my ear a bit. Now, the M20x are also over ear, so that's great for me. It's actually the main reason why I bought these, I wanted a nice pair of over ears that would not impede my hearing. Not only this, I would say they fit even better than my g230s due to the many degrees of freedom, so I am extremely happy here. My issue was solved due to these headphones. The actual foam the headphones use is nice, definitely on the drivers. The headband foam on top is durable and a bit stiff, but not noticeable. The bottom foam seems the same as the drivers, so no problem there. All of the foam seems to be wrapped in a thin fake leather material, and it feels nice. My g230s are just wrapped in perforated fabric, which makes it a tad itchy.<br/><br/>MY OWN JUDGEMENT:<br/><br/>Now, because I like nice things, I want it obvious what I'm using is nice and worth it. I like to make a statement, so I buy things that fall under these categories:<br/><br/>1. Looks cool<br/>2. Does it's job well<br/>3. Lasts a long time<br/><br/>So, for it looking cool, I would say "eh." As I previously stated, the logo isn't painted in, so they just look like headphones from afar. My Sols on the other hand, look 100% sweet, with it's circular drivers, solid looking headband, minimalist logo, and shiny plating (that wore off around the edges of the drivers, sadly). These don't have that aesthetic I'm looking for, but they do look like monitors, which kind of makes up for it. To me, they just look intermediate, not pro.<br/><br/>For doing the job well, that is a definite yes. The cool factor to me can immediately be vetoed in the case that something works like a well oiled machine. This is that case. They just sound good, and anyone who would borrow these would tell. My sols aren't that good sounding, and my g230 is okay, so these are technically the best headphones I own at the moment. A case where this wouldn't be true would be Beats by Dre. Yes, the headphones look very nice, iconic even. Despite this, they pretty much are just a step up from those 5 dollar Koss headphones you buy at drug stores when you have nothing else to use (those headphones are very good for the price though, so I like them for that).<br/><br/>I don't know for certain yet if these will last a long time. This is another factor that directly goes with doing the job well, as having these factors multiply each other makes for a godly product. My Sols and g230s definitely fall under this category, as they have both lasted me 2 years. The Sols are almost done for, however, as the right driver's plastic cone buzzes on certain frequencies. The g230s look literally brand new and haven't degraded audio wise, so they have served me well, and will keep doing so. Beats by Dre also do not fall under this factor, as they must be treated like kings, or either they will shatter the moment you look at them (an anecdote from a friend). Because it misses the two most important factors, Beats headphones are useless to me, especially with the price they ask for. I will have to live with the M20xs for a while to see how well they do with this factor, and I am predicting another strong yes. And even if they only last me a couple months, they are still only $30, an amazing price for what these headphones are. One thing I realized that may break them is extending the drivers over and over again. The metal tracks that are attached to them go in and out of the headband, and you can feel them moving inside through the foam. You can even pinch it and make it really hard to move it (annoying sometimes), which means they aren't encased in anything. This leads me to predict that at some point, they will poke through the band. Because of this, I will not shorten them every time I stow them away. Someone posted a picture that looked like this happened to them, so I will watch out.<br/><br/>OVERALL:<br/><br/>These are an amazing pair of headphones that meet many of my quality standards, as I am a bit of a snob. They sound great, but bass drums can be too quiet or hard to distinguish. They are made very well, despite the freaking long cable and too thick of an end for the jack. They are very comfortable, and solved the issues I had with other headphones I owned. They succeed my personal checklist, but I will need to test for durability. So, as a final statement: if you are on a budget and want nice over ears for sitting down and listening to music, pick up a pair of ATH-M20X headphones. If you have more money, shoot for the M40x or m50x if you want to walk around or need better quality. I am pretty satisfied despite my current situation, so I hope you can enjoy these headphones more than me.</span>

<span>The Audio Technica ATH-M30x are excellent sounding headphones in the sub $100 range. I'm using the M30x as a second pair of headphones to listen to music and when watching movies or TV shows on an iPhone, iPad, or through an AV receiver. I wanted headphones that would sound great, be well built, be portable, and yet be affordably priced. In those regards, the M30x delivers.<br/><br/>The M30x is a nicely designed successor to the popular M30 headphones which they are replacing. I really like Audio Technica's styling update for the M30x, giving it a look similar to the iconic M50 and newer M50x headphones. Like the M50 and M50x, the M30x now features a collapsible design for space saving portability. Both of those are welcome changes from the dated looking and clunkier M30. A few months back I purchased a pair of M30 headphones, used them for a couple of weeks before returning them, and then purchased the M50 headphones. The design and feel of the M30x is much improved from the M30.<br/><br/>-----<br/>SPEC COMPARISON BETWEEN ATH-M30x &amp; ATH-M50x:<br/>The M50 and M30 were the most popular headphones in Audio Technica's Professional Studio Monitor Headphone lineup so my guess is that the M50x and M30x will be also so I've written a spec comparison between models.<br/><br/>1. The M30x has a 40mm driver compared to a 45mm driver in the M50x.<br/>2. The M30x has a frequency response of 15-22,000Hz compared to 15-28,000Hz with the M50x.<br/>3. The M30x has a maximum input power of 1300mW at 1kHz compared to 1600mW at 1kHz with the M50x.<br/>4. The M30x has a sensitivity of 96dB compared to 99dB with the M50x.<br/>5. The M30x has an impedance of 47 ohms compared to 38 ohms with the M50x.<br/>6. The M30x weighs 7.8oz compared to 10oz with the M50x.<br/>7. The M30x has a built in cable compared to detachable cables with the M50x. The straight cables are both 9.8'.<br/><br/>With a higher sensitivity, lower impedance, and higher maximum input power  the M50x are a little easier to drive, are a little louder, and can handle more power before clipping than the M30x.<br/><br/>-----<br/>COMPARING AUDIO TECHNICA's PROFESSIONAL STUDIO MONITOR HEADPHONE LINEUP:<br/>If looking at other models in Audio Technica's lineup, the M20x, M30x, and M40x all have 40mm drivers whereas the M50x has 45mm drivers. All have a frequency response on the low end of 15Hz but as the headphone models get better so do the higher end of the frequency response, 20,000Hz with the M20x up to 28,000Hz with the M50x. The M40x and M50x feature detachable cables whereas the cable in the M20x and M30x is built in to the headphones. The M20x isn't collapsible while all the other models are. When examining sensitivity, impedance, and maximum input power, as the models get better the headphones tend to increase in dB's, become easier to drive with a lower impedance, and are able to handle more power before clipping.<br/><br/>-----<br/>SOUND QUALITY OF M30x &amp; COMPARISON TO M50:<br/>The M30x offers excellent sound quality for its price. The headphones produce a rich, clean, and detailed sound with a good amount of bass. I'm really impressed with the sound they are able to produce.<br/><br/>Having the M50, I was able to do a comparison between the two headphones. Since many reviewers who own both the M50 and M50x headphones state that the two models sound identical, my sound comparison between the M50 and M30x should provide a good comparison in sound between the M30x and newer M50x headphones.<br/><br/>The M50 headphones are a little louder. They produce better bass as a result of the 45mm drivers compared the 40mm drivers in the M30x. The sound from the M50's is also fuller and has better separation. You do get what you pay for but when considering sound to price the M30x offers great bang for your buck.<br/><br/>-----<br/>PROS:<br/>1. Produce a rich, clean, and detailed sound with good bass.<br/>2. Affordably priced, great bang for your buck.<br/>3. Comfortable to wear.<br/>4. Attractive design and lightweight.<br/>5. Collapsible for space saving portability. When collapsed they are noticeably smaller than my M50's collapsed.<br/>6. Comes with protective carrying pouch and 1/4" adapter for headphone plug. The 3.5mm plug allows the M30x to plug into smartphones, tablets, laptops, and desktop computers. The 1/4" adapter allows the headphones to plug into receivers, mixers, and other audio equipment.<br/><br/>CONS:<br/>1. The "L" &amp; "R" indicators for the cans are inside the headband area and are hard to see in dim lit areas. I much prefer their placement on the can swivel mechanism with the M50/M50x. I know its minor especially if you just remember that the cable comes out of the left side but I thought I'd mention it.<br/><br/>-----<br/>SUMMARY:<br/>The ATH-M30x headphones continue Audio Technica's legacy of producing amazing headphones. At the price point of the M30x, they are very hard to beat. If you are looking for a pair of headphones that sound great, are well built, are portable, and yet are affordably priced as I was, I highly recommend the M30x. If considering other Audio Technica models I recommend spending a little extra money and purchasing the M30x over the M20x. The collapsible design is very nice and the M30x allows almost double the maximum input power than the M20x. If sound quality is your concern over price, the M50x is superior with better bass, separation, and a fuller sound. The build quality is also nicer with the M50x. My M50's feel sturdier, the headband extender feels more durable, and I like the swivel feature of the M50 cans. That's not to take away from the M30x because they are well built headphones for the price.</span>

<span>I love my Tascam headphones and its 9.5 foot chord! Yes, Tascam may not be the top brand on the market and I’m certainly not what you would call audiophile, but the sound quality and comfort is comparable to some of the big name brands for a fraction of the cost and depending on your needs. Prior to my purchase, I never heard of the Tascam brand. I usually stick with Sennheiser or Sony but price was my motivator.<br/><br/>Design/build: They have the look and feel of lightweight studio headphones. But… Everything nowadays is plastic and ditto for the headphones. The over-the-head band is plastic with soft foam like material for cushioning. The earcups (ditto) are plastic with the same foam material. They look good and are decently built. I do love the 9.5 foot chord and 3.5mm to 1/4" Adapter so I’m not tethered to sitting in front of my home studio.<br/><br/>Comfort. The ear and head cushions are comfortable and a perfect fit for my size head. The clamping pressure of the headband is mild. They are tight enough to stay on for long periods of time without getting a pressure headache. As over-the-head headphones that rest on ear are concerned, I have found them rather comfortable after 5+ hours (daily) and even after having fallen asleep wearing them on several occasions. The headphones survived and so did my ears with no discomfort the next morning!<br/><br/>Noise Cancelling? Nope. Since the headphones met my price point I never considered “noise cancelling” as a must have feature. The headphones are not “noise cancelling” (so don’t expect to “tune out” your barking dog or TV set), on the other hand, anyone near to you will not be too bothered by your music so I guess it does provide some noise blocking.<br/><br/>Movies, audiobooks and radio: My listening experience is 5-6 hours a day of mixed media. I have found music, vocals and speech to come in clear with a nice balance. They are exceptional for casual listening.<br/><br/>Audio mixing and editing:  I use audition &amp; cakewalk for personal projects and have found them suitable for my purposes, BUT I would caution against using these for serious professional work. If cost is not an issue, I would definitely consider upgrading.<br/><br/>Gaming. Great sound.<br/><br/>Overall, I am pleased with my purchase. As they say, you get what you pay for. For once, I can honestly say you’re getting a better value for the price which just doesn’t happen much anymore. These are a great price, good value, portable, durable, and good sound quality at a price that’s hard to beat. I’m assuming you don’t have money to burn if you are considering these, so take a chance. I think you will be satisfied with the purchase.</span>

<span>Pros<br/>- Affordable<br/>- Good sound quality (cancels some nearby noise)<br/>- Long cord<br/>- Comes with an adapter for bigger jacks<br/><br/>Con (the dealbreaker for me)<br/>- Uncomfortable; I like that these headphones can fit really big heads but the cups can squeeze your head pretty tight. Even if you wore them enough to lessen the tightness, the cups themselves don't hug the ears comfortably as they are pretty small. In other words, your ears might not fit into them</span>

<span>I've owned a pair of these for nearly three years now and they still sound and work great. It was only just this week that the earpads began to fall apart, but I was able to get replacement ones for a little under $20.<br/><br/>I use these nearly every day for hours at a time. I run a music review blog where I'm constantly analyzing and comparing music and these have helped me get an accurate representation of the music. They're also great for mixing and producing, especially if you're on a budget. My only complaint is I wish the earpads and head cushion were slightly more plush as it can get a little uncomfortable after 2-3 hours of straight use. In all, these are extremely durable and they sound great. I would recommend these to anybody.</span>

<span>I'm no audiophile, gotta get that out of the way.<br/><br/>Three stars?  This is because of the cable, maybe nit-picky, but touching/movement of the cable resonates a very annoying sound into the headphones.  Also, if you grew up with a telephone with a coiled cable you will receive flashbacks about how awful they are.<br/><br/>So audio quality, these are definitely the best headphones I've ever used.  Plugging them into my Mac Book Pro with with DAC and dolby atmos turned on is absolutely amazing.  Must repeat, I am no audiophile or claim to have a heightened sense of hearing, also, my first "professional" set of headphones.  I do own Bose QC35, HyperX, Airpod Pros, all with their own function, but these Sennheiser's definitely have better sound and bass compared to my other headphones.<br/><br/>I will probably gift these to a friend and buy another pair with a replaceable straight cable, but with the fault I mentioned I still think they are amazing but would not buy this specific model with the same cable again.</span>

<span>The Sennheiser HD 280 Pro "New Model" Assembled in the USA is a game-changer for me. Over the years I have tried several Senn Closed-Back headphones only to wonder how they could make some of the best Open Back Headphones and some of the worst Closed headphones. I'll back up a bit. My first pair of headphones was a pair of Koss Pro 4AA's. I had just gotten out of the Army and it was 1971. I loved them. I still have a pair of Koss Porta Pros to this day. My current headphone collection includes the Sennheiser HD 580 Jubilee, HD 650, and the New Model 280 HD Pro. I also have a pair each of the  Fostex T50RP MK3; the Sony MDR V900HD and the Sony MDR 7506, The original Audio Technica ATH M30 and the ATH M40fs, as well as a vintage pair of JVC HA-D990's that are not for sale.  None of these headphones are.<br/><br/>While none of the above info proves anything where my headphone expertise is concerned, it does prove I have good taste where headphones are concerned. So here's the thing. With the New Model HD280Pro Sennheiser has shown the World that it can make a very competitive Closed-Back headphone at a price almost anyone can afford. In addition to the New Model Senn 280 I also recently bought a pair of Audio Technica ATH M40x headphones. In my opinion, they are not even close to being as well built as my Old pair of Audio Technica ATH M30s. In direct comparison the Old M30s make the relatively New ATH M40X cans seem like a toy to me. Nor did they have near the sonic relationship with either my Solid State Emotiva A-100 BASX Amp or my Little Dot MK II tube amp. At about the same price the New M40x was not an improvement over my Old M40fs cans. In my opinion the M40x is a joke compared to my M40fs cans. About the same price, but not even close in every other respect. The M40x is a throwaway can, the M40fs is a keeper. The New Model Sennheiser HD280 Pro is a keeper as well. Very Neutral can. Lows, Mids, and Highs are ready to reveal what has been recorded.  If you don't like their sound it is probably your Sound Souce that is at fault. Some Bands are really not very good. Some Recording Engineers are not very good either. Some Bands and some Recording Engineers are great. The New Model HD280Pro will reveal which it is. Become an Audiophile. If Zen is selling water by a river, then being an audiophile is learning to know the difference between dogs barking and a host of singing angels Don't get me wrong. Sometimes barking at the moon is just what the good Doctor ordered. But nothing compares to the singing of angels. I think I will shut up for now and try out my New Model Sennheiser HD280s on two of my favorite angels. George Jones, and Patsy Cline. It doesn't get any better than that. Amen..</span>

<span>I was recommended this all the way in 2015 by YouTuber MKBHD and I was very happy with my purchase. It has served me many years of great listening. I used it mainly for video editing and just general music listening. Overtime the cups had a bit of wear and tear and even one of the latches broke on one side so it didn’t sit correctly on my head.

<span>I recently needed to replace my pair of over the ear headphones so I began my search for a good pair of headphones in the $150-$200 range. Immediately Senhiser, Beyerdynamic, and Audio‑Technica stood out. I first received a pair of the Audio‑Technica ATH M-50x which had good sound but were very uncomfortable if worn for more than an hour or so. Then I picked up a pair of the Beyerdynamic DT 770. These headphones had amazing sound quality and comfort but the passive sound isolation was mediocre at best. Which is why I ordered a pair of the Beyerdynamic Premium 990 which are open back. I figured that the sound quality and comfort would be similar but the open back quality would allow me to talk with others while I played music. Unfortunately the 990's had worse sound quality than the 770 (a bit harsher sounding and not as clear) and were very uncomfortable even after only a couple of hours. During this time I also ordered a pair of Senhiser HD 599 headphones. While these headphones have a significantly different sound signature than the others I have tried, they were of similar quality. Overall the HD 599's were slightly less comfortable than the 770's but the open back quality was convenient and the sound was quite nice. I would have been satisfied with the HD 599's but they were the only pair of headphones I could not drive with my desktop. They produced terrible static. This did not occur when I used the 599's on other devices or when I used other headphones (even those with similar impedance and SPL) driven by my desktop computer. This prevented me from keeping them. I have attached a breakdown of my thoughts below:<br/><br/>------------Sound Quality------------<br/><br/>Beyerdynamic DT 770 (80 Ohm) - Winner<br/>Highs - Quite good representation, much cleaner than Senhiser<br/>Mids - Quite good representation<br/>Lows - A little closed sounding but overall they are handled well<br/>Overall this is how the music should sound. They perform the most similar to my pair of Martin Logan Motion 15's (bookshelf speakers)<br/><br/>Beyerdynamic Premium 990 (32 Ohm)<br/>Highs - Similar to the 770's but rather harsh sounding<br/>Mids - Nothing special, no major issues<br/>Lows - Not as powerful as the 770's but more spacious. Seemed a bit washed out due to the open back design<br/><br/>Senhiser HD 599 (50 Ohm) - Close 2nd Best<br/>Highs - Not quite as poppy as they should be. They are a bit muted in the sound signature which can make them less fatiguing than other, more analytical, headphones.<br/>Mids - A bit to high level for me, it tended to make punk rock music sound very close and muddied<br/>Lows - A bit boomy but very spacious<br/><br/>Audio Technica ATH M-50x<br/>Highs - Quite good representation, a bit cold though<br/>Mids - Nothing special, no major issues though<br/>Lows - Too over-emphasized<br/><br/>-----------------Comfort---------------<br/><br/>Beyerdynamic DT 770 - Winner<br/>Perfect. I wore these on multiple occasions for more than 7 hours and never noticed any pressure points or discomfort. The headband is larger than average to distribute the pressure. The clamp pressure is also a bit more than average but this was not an issue due to the soft, replaceable, ear pads.<br/><br/>Beyerdynamic Premium 990<br/>I could not wear these for more than a few hours. The headband is made of a much harder material than the 770's and causes a painful pressure point on the top of my head. I believe this is made worse by the lower clamping force since more of the weight is on the top of your head.<br/><br/>Senhiser HD 599<br/>I could wear these for several hours as long as I moved them around every 30-40 minutes. More comfortable than the 990's. Significantly less clamping force than the 770's.<br/><br/>Audio Technica ATH M-50x<br/>These were the least comfortable. I could only stand to wear them for an hour or so before I had to take them off. All of the discomfort came from the top of my head.<br/><br/>----------------Usability---------------<br/><br/>Beyerdynamic DT 770<br/>These come with a permanently attached 10ft cable. That was a lot of cable to get in my pocket every time I got up from my desk. The cable also has more insulation making it much thicker and stiffer than average.<br/><br/>Beyerdynamic DT 990<br/>These come with a permanently attached 10ft cable. That was a lot of cable to get in my pocket every time I got up from my desk. The cable also has more insulation making it much thicker and stiffer than average. The open back design was also a plus for me since I work in a semi-quiet office environment and I could still hold a conversation with someone while listening to music. But I could not hear others quite as well as I could with the HD 599's.<br/><br/>Senhiser HD 599<br/>The interchange-able cables with different lengths worked perfect for home listening as well as on the go. The cable is also thinner and more flexible than the Beyerdynamic cable. The open back design was also a plus for me since I work in a semi-quiet office environment and I could still hold a conversation with someone while listening to music. The only downfall is the issue I had with compatibility between some devices and this pair of headphones where I would hear static or computer noise when driving them with a computer.<br/><br/>Audio Technica ATH M-50x<br/>I really love the long coiled cable that came with these. To me this is the best option since I dont have to lug around a long cable or risk losing extra cables. With that being said, it also came with a ~ 9ft straight cable and 3ft straight cable if the coiled cable is too much for you.</span>

<span>There's probably not much I can say about these headphones that hasn't already been said many times, but nonetheless, they are fantastic and worth every dollar (seems to go between $100 - $150 these days).<br/><br/>First of all, the most important factor for me when I made this purchase (aside from decent audio quality) was the build quality of the headphones. I needed something that could withstand years of regular, often heavy, usage while still managing to be comfortable and durable. I've paid much more for headphones before only to have the chassis start to crack 4 months in, require superglue by 6 months, and be completely die 9 months in. I needed something I could buy and not have to think about. Two years into daily usage (1-8 hrs per day) and these have not even a speck of evidence of damage on the plastic assembly nor the materials themselves. In fact, they look almost exactly the way they did when I first bought them in 2015, aside from the headrest cushion at the uppermost part being slightly compressed from regular use. This is actually incredible to me, considering my experiences with past headphones. To me, this build quality is unprecedented, especially for the price point. Bear in mind I have used these on bike rides, planes, while jogging - everywhere - all the while sitting on my oily head, and I have no reason to believe they will wear out any time soon.<br/><br/>As I said, the structural integrity of the headphones is what was most important to me, and these deliver on all ends in that regard. The other properties of the headphones are just as great, but are much more brief to review:<br/><br/>-Audio quality: Incredible, and what seems to be a very balanced EQ. I don't know about using these as professional studio monitors, but anything short of that and these are golden. Unless you listen to all of your music in FLAC, you will probably not observe any meaningful difference between these and a reasonably high-end pair of headphones. For casual listening and / or people who don't care about highly compressed music, these actually may be overboard, but once again, at the price point, you can't really go wrong. These also get loud as hell and stay impressively balanced, if you're into that.<br/><br/>-Comfort: Once again, amazing. I have used these some days for an upward of 10 hours, and it's easy to forget that I even have them on if nothing is playing. The cups are the perfect size, and the length is adjustable, up to about 2 inches on each end.<br/><br/>-Noise isolation: Not something I was looking for at all (I don't care about outside sound), but these still deliver quite well on this end. If someone is talking in the same room, you might be able to hear them, but anything past that (ambient noises, people in other rooms, etc.) and it will be completely dampened. Fantastic for public transit, planes, and long car rides (provided you're not the one driving!)<br/><br/>-Portability: They're big, but still very convenient to move around. They fold into themselves to take up about 50% of the space (the first time I did this I was terrified that I was breaking them), and the removable cable means you can leave your long cable in your PC, amp, etc., and use a shorter one for outside / non-stationary listening (the box should come with both sizes). I also like that the cable is removable since a toasted cable doesn't mean you have to replace the entire unit. Seems to be a ~$20 replacement, but I've not had to replace cables - they seem pretty durable and I have not had any issues with them at all.<br/><br/>-Electrical build quality: I've not noticed any fading, sound cutting, or quality loss in the two years I've had them. Not much to say on this end, good stuff!<br/><br/>-Aesthetics: Simple, clean, no frills; just the way I want a pair of headphones to be. I love the fact these just do their job are not a fashion statement (or maybe they are, but perhaps only among first year audio production majors haha).<br/><br/>Overall, an easy perfect score. These completely fulfill their purpose and then some. Paired up with a very fair low-medium to mid-range price point, I would definitely recommend these to a friend or anyone looking to dive into their first pair of good headphones but aren't sure where to start (and want to enjoy a product that will last seemingly forever).</span>

<span>I am a classic music lover, and this product fits my needs perfectly.  I was tired of putting up with shoddy designs that fall apart. Often it is the foam isolation that fails. In my lab I located a worn-out pair of Bose earphones, and I was determined to effect some kind of repair. I invented a new design that yields an earphone that is at least the equal of the best on the market, including Bose, Sennheiser, and even ATH.<br/><br/>I will tell you how to do it.<br/><br/>I begin by pulling apart the sticky elements that hold the earphone together, until I am left with a foam ring and a few pieces of cloth. The process continues --<br/><br/>1. Stick the foam ring and pieces of cloth back onto the earphone cup.<br/><br/>2. Mount a single layer of Beige Masking Tape over the cup, pulling on the tape edges to create a flat surface. An overlap of perhaps 3/16 inch between pieces of tape can be used.<br/><br/>3. Fold the edges of the tape around the edge of the cup, to hold it in place.<br/><br/>4. Apply a thin ring of Gorilla Expanding Glue to the surface of the tape and use your forefinger to distribute it uniformly over the entire surface in the thinnest possible layer. You want to minimize the weight of the resulting membrane.<br/><br/>5. Set aside to dry - about two hours.  I did this five times to perfect my technique.<br/><br/>This process has unexpected consequences. The masking tape acts as a membrane interface between the cup and the ear. Before coating, the tape is floppy with poor frequency response.  But as the glue dries, it permeates the tape, creating a semi-transparent membrane with perfect compliance to the sound wave. This may be observed in process.<br/><br/>As the glue dries, the frequency response suddenly increases to equal that of the best of good headphones, and the new membrane will respond to every nuance in the available sound.  Expanding Gorilla Glue is a MAGIC component in this design. The combination of Gorilla Glue and Masking Tape yields a new membrane that is unsurpassed in acoustical properties.<br/><br/>An even greater surprise comes when we see there is no aperture in the new membrane. The cup is completely covered with a continuous membrane that delivers complete<br/>compliance with the sound wave. Then the great rolling bass and bell-like treble of the Steinway Model D concert grand piano is fully revealed.</span>

<span>My second time buying these. My first ones still work but the material on the muffs started coming off. I couldn’t find replacements, but these worked so well I wanted another set.

<span>Had a very nice pair of Bose that got "borrowed" from me on an international flight, decided I wasn't going to spend that much on another temporary set of NC earphones, I found this model by Sony.  It was about $50 at the time, which was only a quarter of my first (now traveling somewhere without me) NC headset.  I really like the simplicity and affordability of them, haven't lost these because they look so plain :-)<br/><br/>Sound is clear, sound reduction is decent, have recommended them to several cabin crew and fellow passengers, even bought a couple sets to give my parents when they retired and took the 'round the world' dream trip they'd been saving and planning for, having NC headsets was equally appreciated by them!<br/><br/>They do not come with any sort of stowage bag included, so recommend you grab something appropriate to keep the kit (headset and cord, it's included legacy airline twin-plug adapter, and a spare battery) neatly contained, rather than tossed loosely in your carry-on bag.  I found a very simple cloth "cosmetic brush" bag that fits the bill perfectly, YMMV.<br/><br/>I mention these have a couple minor drawbacks...<br/><br/>First, if you're looking for Bluetooth or wireless, these are wired use only.  On the other hand, their cord and simple appearance also makes these look to be an ordinary set of headphones and not a desired theft item.<br/><br/>Second, these are not rechargeable, and it is easy to forget about powering down after a flight, so good idea to carry an extra AAA battery in your kit.  On the other hand, the power switch is not easily bumped, so you won't accidentally turn them on in your bag, and the battery drain is rather low so that even after a couple days sitting "ON" in my bag, they were still working.<br/><br/>Overall, a very worthy purchase, and an item I recommend to others, though I think Sony could have stepped them up a notch by giving them rechargeable capability, via USB cable or such, and knock off a star for that reason in hopes they consider this feedback as a suggestion of how to improve an already decent product -- sometimes the little bits of customer input is all it takes to effect change, right?  This whole BT trend, not a huge fan myself, but point it out for those that want BT connectivity on everything.</span>

<span>I've owned the Sony 1000XM3, H900N, and the Bose QC35 II.  I couldn't wait for the XM4 to come out because of the multipoint Bluetooth (I'll get to that a little later).  The sound is great once it's been adjusted, and the noise cancelling in the XM4 is better than both the XM3 and the QC35 II.  However, there are quite a few things that are very poorly implemented and basically unusable.<br/><br/>Sound: A-<br/>First off the XM4, XM3, and H900N all have better and brighter sound than the QC35 II.  Out of the box, the sound is a little dull and the mids / vocals are a little mushy.  With the XM4, I needed to tweak it in the Headphones app using the EQ to get it to the place that I wanted it, but once it was there, it was great.  A small but pleasing improvement in the XM4 is that the headphone voice announcements are at a much higher quality.  The XM3 announcements are low fidelity and low bandwidth whereas the XM4 headphone voice is very crisp and hi-fi.  Sony also replaced the high-pitched beep with a slightly longer but more pleasant sounding bell for feedback.  However, I actually prefer the beep because it's faster.<br/><br/>Noise cancelling: A-<br/>When I first put on the XM4 and turned them on, I was surprised by the audible hiss from the noise cancelling.  It wasn't present with the XM3.  I think this is because they have cranked up the noise cancelling in the XM4.  I have air purifiers running in my house, and the XM4 does a better job of cancelling out the noise almost completely.  The XM3 still has some leakage.  The XM3 is just as good as the Bose in noise cancellation, and the XM4, though a little hissy and is a slightly bit better.  The drawback to this is that it can feel like it's creating a slight pressure in my head that increases over time.<br/><br/>Multipoint Bluetooth: F<br/>This was the feature I had been waiting for.  The awesome noise cancellation and sound of the XM3, but with the ability to stream two devices at once.  FAIL!  I had been eagerly anticipating this and checking daily for the release of the XM4.  I was so excited to get them...only to be sorely disappointed.  Though the device will connect to two devices simultaneously, it actually DISCONNECTS when one of the two devices is activated.  So it's not true multipoint Bluetooth.  Sony advertises that the multipoint Bluetooth is seamless.  This is true if they mean you don't have to press any buttons to disconnect from a device.  However, the way it manages connections is very poor.  I have to put the XM4 into pairing mode if I've connected to my phone in order for it to play audio from my computer.  If I don't do this, it doesn't recognize that my computer is playing sound, and then doesn't stream the sound.  Even though it shows on my computer as connected, it doesn't show up in my sound options as a device that I can use for audio.  I have to turn them off, put them into pairing mode, and then reconnect in order to get the sound to play.  If a call comes in on my phone, the headphones actually disconnect from the computer to switch to the call - and the headphone voice announces that they have disconnected, super annoying and not seamless.  With the QC35 II, I could use both at the same time, with the phone being connected at the low-quality voice mode and my computer at the high quality music mode.  They had 2 years to get the multipoint Bluetooth right and they totally failed.  So it ends up that I have to turn the XM4 off and re-pair them just like I had to with the XM3.  I've had to do this a number of times, and I haven't quite figured out all the exact situations where I have to re-pair them.  With the XM3, I knew if I wanted to switch devices, I would have to do it.  But with the XM4, I haven't put my finger on all of them just yet.  At any rate, the switching of devices is very clunky and definitely not worth upgrading for.  I have $40 headphones that implement multipoint Bluetooth better than the XM4. I'm stunned and disappointed that Sony hasn't been able to get multipoint Bluetooth to work right.<br/><br/>Comfort: A<br/>Compared to the XM3, the XM4 are slightly softer and a bit more comfortable right when I put them on.  The XM3 are still pretty comfortable, but the earpads are definitely firmer and a little tighter.<br/><br/>Controls: B<br/>I totally prefer the actual buttons on the QC35 II to the touch controls.  Sometimes if I want to change the volume and I slide my finger at a slightly off-angle, it will skip tracks instead.  It's a small annoyance.  On the plus side, the physical buttons do make a fairly audible click that travels through the headphone, whereas the touch controls are a little quieter.<br/><br/>In-call: D<br/>One thing the Bose QC35 II does is that when I'm on a call, it knows to automatically turn on ambient sound mode so I can hear myself talking.  Neither the XM3 nor the XM4 figured out that this is a useful and great feature, so they don't do it.  If I want it, I have to press the button to switch to it, listen to the announcement, and then it comes on.  Then when I'm done, I have to press the button and wait for it to go into NC off, ambient sound off, and then press the button again and wait for the announcement that the NC is once again activated.  Super slow and awkward and unusable.  So instead, I pull one of the earcups off my ear so I can hear myself speak.  When I first was using the Sony's for calls, I was finding that my voice was tired and my throat sore at the end of the day.  Someone told me that I talked really loud when I was on the phone.  I didn't even know this because the headphones do a really great job of keeping outside sound out, so I was talking at a level so I could hear myself when I was wearing them.  I asked Sony support about this, and the headphones just don't do this.  Fail.<br/><br/>Auto-mute: F<br/>Sony created a feature where the headphones will automatically mute the audio source if it detects that you're talking.  Nice in concept - terrible in practice.  I just turned it off and left it off.  If I'm listening to music and sneeze or make a noise, the headphones will interrupt what I'm listening to and mute it for the amount of time I've specified in the app - 15 seconds is the shortest amount of time.  So I have to wait for it to unmute so that I can continue listening.  What's even more annoying is when I'm using the auxiliary cable in wired mode - again, this is because the multipoint Bluetooth implementation is such a pain and sucks, if I'm on a video conference and I have the headphones on to use the noise cancelling, if I talk, it mutes the audio stream for 15 seconds so I can't hear what anyone in the conference is saying.  So I then have to turn the headphones off in order to interact with the conference in any meaningful way.<br/><br/>Miscellaneous:<br/>I don't understand why Sony doesn't just include a headphone cable with a microphone.  With all the video-conferencing I do, and the terrible multipoint Bluetooth implementation, I end up using the auxiliary headphone cable a lot.  It's much faster and convenient for me to switch the plug from my computer to my phone rather than dealing with the horrible Bluetooth switching.  The auxiliary cable Sony provides doesn't have a microphone, so I have to hold my phone close to my mouth if I'm using the cable.  I ended up buying an auxiliary cable with a microphone and some playback controls on it and it works great.  Here's another really poorly thought-out thing: upon pairing the new XM4 with the app, it gives me the opportunity to give feedback on the headphones.  This is only upon the initial startup of the headphones.  How on earth can I give meaningful feedback about the headphones on my first use?  It took me to Sony's site to do the survey, and I decided I would complete it later, only to discover that it had timed out, and now I'm not able to provide feedback through that mechanism.<br/><br/>Conclusion:<br/>All the hype about multipoint Bluetooth is a big letdown with the real product.  If that's the reason you're thinking about upgrading, don't do it.  The rest of it is pretty similar to the XM3.  Some nice little features added, but nothing earth shattering.  The new features on paper were everything that I wanted that was missing from the XM3.  In practice, the XM4 implementation of these things just did not hit the mark.  I soooo wanted to love these headphones, so that I could stop looking for headphones.  As it stands, they totally weren't worth the upgrade and I will most likely be sending these back.  Sadly, they are not as advertised.</span>

<span>In passive mode, the sound quality is all over the place, resulting in some of the worst headphones I've ever used in this price bracket. In active mode, it's... decent, with boomy, mildly unclean bass; acceptable mids; and messy but listenable highs. It is very responsive to EQ past sub-bass range, though you can crank up the already boomy mid-bass if that's your thing and it can get pretty loud. At about 70–80% volume, the amp begins to distort, and at 100% volume the distortion is highly audible and really crunches the highs and muddies the bass. There is also a noticeable frequency response and volume difference between the cups, likely due to the indentation for the sensor array inside the left cup; if you aren't listening for it, it is still noticeable sometimes, but it fades to the background if you are using the noise canceling or are otherwise occupied.<br/>The ambient sound feature does not pick up outside sounds very clearly. If you're using the Sony | Headphones Connect app, you can enable a "voice mode" for ambient sound that cuts out the bass and boosts vocal range with EQ, but it cannot be turned on with the toggle buttons on the headphones themselves or when connected to PC, making it tedious to enable without the automatic switching feature that tracks your location and habits to enable it when it thinks you need it. The noise canceling however is truly top of its class and easily removes 80–90% of outside noise, and you can't hear anything else if you're playing something. I have noticed that the DSP appears to crank up the bass, either to compensate for the harder-to-remove low-end frequencies or to trick you into thinking the noise canceling is better than it really is in that range.<br/>The ear cup touch controls work fine and I have not had any mis-inputs, though volume up/down steps are too small. You can hold down the up/down slider instead of repeatedly sliding your finger, but the repeat delay is very long and it takes forever to adjust to what you want.<br/>The headphones are fairly adjustable to different head shapes, but if you have a reeeally big head/ears or lots of hair it may be difficult. The headband padding is a bit hard but the headphones are so light you can't feel it. The closed cups have no ventilation so your ears stay warm, and I imagine it would get sweaty in warmer weather.<br/>The headphones can fold flat and can sit around your neck comfortably. The auto-pause when it detects you remove them, and the 15 minute auto-off means you don't ever need to bother turning them off explicitly, just take them off your head and put them down. Their ability to fold also works great for stowing them, and you can fit them into any bag. The included carry case is a bit bulkier than it probably needs to be, but it's still small enough to fit in even a medium sized purse, and it does have room for cables and small accessories.<br/>The mic quality is pretty bad and doesn't pick up your voice well. What it does pick up well is everything around you. You'd think Sony's engineers could have used the ambient sound mics to dampen outside noise while focusing on your voice, but it unfortunately doesn't do that. Call sound quality in general takes a major dive due to the protocol it uses under the hood; it halves the sample rate and sounds like a cheap dollar store headset.<br/>The battery is massive; I charged it to 90% once I received it a few days ago and have not had to charge it since with daily listening. Rtings.com got 37 hours out of one charge, far past the advertised duration.<br/><br/>Overall all of the features work to an acceptable level, except passive mode sound quality. If you are buying these for the battery longevity, small stowable size, ease of use, and noise isolation and canceling, they're a great package. Great for traveling. Would not recommend for even casual listening, get a good closed back pair like the Hifiman HE-R9 + Bluemini R2R wireless dongle. If you need to make important calls or want headphones for conference calls or online meetings, these will work, but it won't be pleasant—get a dedicated conference headset.<br/><br/>If you really insist on these for more active listening situations, do yourself a favor and get the AutoEQ preset for them as a baseline, and tweak to your ears. I also recommend a -1dB loss on the left earcup to help offset the response difference, though it's an approximation and not perfect and differences in track volume will make this obvious. With these changes, passive mode is at least bearable.</span>

<span>Because I do so many meetings over Teams (I'm a professional software trainer), I thought it would be time to finally invest in a really good headset. Up until now, I'd been using a $50 over-ear set by MPOW with a really nice boom mic. It was great, but it wasn't wireless, certainly wasn't portable, and didn't have the audio quality I'd want when listening to music.<br/><br/>I thought that by splurging more than $300 on a Sony product I'd get something that was beyond all of my expectations. I was almost right, but so very wrong in other ways.<br/><br/>CASE: Let's start here. The case is as slim as can be, very high-quality build, looks nice, feels nice, keeps everything protected. Excellent design here with one flaw: you can't really charge the headphones while they're snug in the case; they don't fold up the right way.<br/><br/>APP: To use most of the features, Sony requires you to download an app to your smartphone. That wasn't a big deal and the app was easy to figure out. It crashed twice on me (once during the first setup, again the next day). It offered some location-based services but I declined and it never asked me again. It wanted me to sign up for a free trial of some 360° music service -- not sure what that is, but I skipped it. I was disappointed that there wasn't a PC version of the app. For example, if I needed to switch which device the headphones were connected to, I can only do that from my phone -- that means my phone always has to be one of the two devices. There's no way to control the advanced features, or the equalizer, from the PC.<br/><br/>PAIRING: Bluetooth pairing was hit or miss, over and over again. If I were only pairing to my phone, I think it would be fine. But I wanted to also pair it to my desktop and laptop. The device supports pairing to two devices at the same time -- which was great -- but nearly every time I wanted to switch devices I had to literally turn off bluetooth so the headset would "let go". Other times, upon reconnecting, the mic wouldn't work. Once, which turned out to be the final straw for me, was when I could not get the headset to work in Teams no matter what I tried, even though it worked fine a few hours earlier. (For context: I literally train employees and other trainers on how to use Teams, so I very much know what I'm doing.)<br/><br/>SOUND QUALITY: Let me say that the sound quality IS exceptional. I had a blast listening to all my favorite songs streaming from my phone or laptop. I really can't understate the quality, base and treble. And the ANC (active noise cancelling) was AMAZING. I could be sitting right next to a whole house fan and not hear it. I was blown away.<br/><br/>RANGE: Twice during the day I tried walking around while on a call. It wasn't until I went downstairs that anyone said the quality of my voice had dropped. If I was less than 25 feet from the device, everything was great.<br/><br/>BATTERY LIFE: After a day of use it was down to about 50% and that impressed me. Then I watched TV and ate dinner and later that evening I put on the headphones and realized that the battery dropped to 10%. I thought the system had an auto-off feature but something didn't quite work.<br/><br/>CHARGING: So after my surprise drop in battery, I plugged it into my desktop with a USB C cable I already had. A little light on the headset turned red. When I woke up the next morning, I was surprised to learn that the headphones were still at 10%. Apparently the USB C cable I use to charge my mouse won't charge the headphones. I guess you need to use the cable it ships with? I'm not sure what the deal was here, but that was pretty annoying.<br/><br/>CONTROLS: I found the touch/gesture controls to be mostly intuitive. Pro Tip: If you swipe up and hold your finger, the volume slowly increments up. Once, however, I accidentally hung up a Teams call when I was trying to adjust the volume. I love the feature that let's me hear ambient sound by cupping my hear -- super cool. Tap the power button to hear the battery level -- very nice touch! However, there's one extremely important flaw in the controls that I was shocked to discover. THERE IS NO MUTE BUTTON. The ONLY way to mute your mic during a call (Teams, phone, Zoom, etc) is to use the mute button on the desktop/phone. The headset, whose very first bullet is "clear hands-free calling", has five built-in microphones, and a dedicated gesture to use Alexa... doesn't have a damn mute button. Sadly, the successor to this (the 1000XM5) has the same flaw.<br/><br/>Individually, the issues I raised wouldn't be enough for me to return the headset or give it a low rating. But for a $350 purchase, I expect it to be able to do what it says correctly. I expect a mute button. I expect it to power off when not in use. I expect any generic USB cable to work. I expect to be able to join a meeting without fussing with bluetooth.<br/><br/>I'd totally keep this if all I wanted it for was to listen to music.</span>

<span>I get easily distracted by my environment, especially sounds, so I needed noise cancelling headphones. This was my main reason for looking into buying these, so I’m not much help when it comes to audio quality specifics, though the sound quality does seem great to me.<br/><br/>My AirPod pros are nice and quick to connect and use. The noise cancelling works pretty well since they sit in the ear, but they can get uncomfortable. I wanted over the ear headphones that were noise cancelling, comfortable, could be wired or wireless, and had good sound quality. These Sony ones are exactly what I was looking for.<br/><br/>I’ve tried so many inexpensive noise cancelling headphones, but they simply didn’t work well. I could always hear my surroundings, which would distract from my work and make me far less productive than I could’ve been. Sound quality was always meh, and most were either bluetooth or wired when I needed both. My pc’s bluetooth isn’t great, so I wanted the option to plug and listen, while still being able to use wireless with my devices.<br/><br/>While the noise cancelling isn’t so perfect that I can’t hear anything around me 100%, it’s enough that when listening to music or whatever audio, it drowns out most noise enough for me to concentrate. Some external noises can still come through that I think are just higher pitched, but these Sony headphones are leaps and bounds better than the others I’ve tried, which I’d hope for at this price.<br/><br/>They’ve improved my ability to complete my work and do tasks so much better for the last few months that I’ve had them. Even wearing them in crowded areas has been nice, and I’m not trading sound quality for noise cancelling or vice versa.<br/><br/>Although they’re expensive, they’ve been worth the price for me, and not having to use AirPods all the time has been a huge plus and a nice relief for my ears.<br/><br/>Edit to add that I also appreciate that I can have 2 things using the headphones at once. Typically it’s my phone and tablet, and I can just switch to another registered device easily. Also the microphone is nice for phone calls. Not sure how it sounds for the person on the other end, but must be fine if they can hear me. I don’t use it often, just them as regular headphones. They’re great though.</span>

The 'integrated semi-open air' design incorporates a highly accurate dynamic transducer, and an acoustically tuned venting structure behind the element produces a naturally open sound quality. The circumaural (around-the-ear) pads are designed for hours of wearing comfort, while the steel-cable, self-adjusting headband construction and single-sided professional quality audio interconnect ensure extended reliability in demanding professional studio applications. Proven, popular, excellent - New, improved and even better. Made in China. The item includes the OFC screw type cable.   From the Manufacturer   The AKG K 240 Studio is an update of the "classic" AKG K 240 Monitor. The new K 240 Studio delivers even wider dynamic range and higher sensitivity than its well-known and widely-used predecessor. The secret to the semi-open K 240 Studio's sound quality is the new XXL transducers in acoustically tuned vented enclosures with circumaural (around the ear) pads. The circumaural pads envelope your ears nicely and reward you with smooth, solid bass and well-balanced, articulate mids and highs.Founded in Vienna, Austria in 1947, AKG has built a legendary reputation in the professional audio industry for products that perform flawlessly. The reputation of AKG and its celebrated quality are built on more than 55 years of experience, incredible design, meticulous craftsmanship and a clear understanding of what truly sounds right. AKG introduced the K 140 in 1974 and the K 240 Monitor in 1975, which became the most widely used headphones in recording studios and broadcast facilities worldwide. Generations of musicians and audio engineers use these AKG products to create great mixes, hit songs and albums cherished by millions around the world. The new AKG Professional Studio headphones carry on the tradition of these audio tools and are a sound investment that will pay handsome returns with years of flawless sonic performance for professional recording engineers and demanding users of high quality home or portable audio equipment. Delivers solid bass and well-balanced mids and highs XXL Transducers with Varimotion DiaphragmThe new XXL transducers use AKG's patented Varimotion diaphragm to ensure extremely accurate response at any listening level. This technology creates a diaphragm that is thinner, more elastic toward the outside edges for more powerful bass response and thicker, less resonant in the center for pure, accurate mids and clear, detailed highs. The large size of the transducers makes the overall sound more life-like and three-dimensional to capture the emotional and sonic content of your soundtracks.Gimbal-Type SuspensionTo ensure your listening comfort, AKG Professional Studio headphones utilize a self-adjusting headband with a flexible steel structure to deliver optimum fit for your headphones without any fiddling. The structure is flexible, yet strong enough to allow bending for single ear use and is durable enough to withstand rough handling. A gimbal-type suspension ensures the earcups of all AKG Professional Studio models will conform to the shape and size of your ears without pressing on them for hours of fatigue-free, comfortable listening.Wear Them As You LikeRugged construction, a non-twisting headband, and powerful sound allow you to use your headphones on a single ear only or wear them in any other way you may prefer. AKG Professional Studio headphones are ideal for DJ and live sound use because they are durable enough to withstand the roughest kind of handling during transport or on stage.Detachable Cable with Mini XLR ConnectorThe new AKG Professional Studio headphones utilize a detachable input cable for easy replacement if ever necessary. The cable and headphones use mini XLR connectors for perfect contact and secure mechanical connection. The cable is made of 99.99% oxygen-free copper and has gold plated plugs on both ends including the screw-on 1/8" to 1/4" stereo jack adapter for maximum signal transfer.Perfect for Portable AudioYou need good quality audio for all your listening--including computer, minidisc, portable CD or DAT player--as well as in the studio. Owing to their high sensitivity and wide dynamic range, the AKG Professional Series headphones are efficient enough to be used with these lower level output sources and still deliver the high definition sound you need when working in the studio or on stage. The excellent workmanship AKG headphones are known for and high quality components ensure loss-free transmission and reproduction of high-resolution signals from all types of digital audio sources.

<span>I want to start off by saying if you are looking for some bass-heavy, hard-hitting rumpa-thump headphones, these are not for you. These were quite literally not made for that purpose.<br/><br/>If, however, you are looking for a nice set of BALANCED headphones that will give you CLARITY then these are a wonderful set to have!<br/><br/>As a voice actor, it's highly important to be able to get as accurate an impression of vocals as possible when mixing and mastering for commercials or even auditions, and these cans pull that off beautifully. I am noticing things with these headphones that I did not notice on my previous pair of off-brand headphones.<br/><br/>Several people have complained about sound "leaking" from these headphones. These are open-backed, which makes for better audio dynamics. This is by design, it is NOT a flaw. These are STUDIO headphones for a reason, and assume you will be working in isolation where any sound that makes it out/in won't be an issue.<br/><br/>TLDR: If you are looking for something you can jack up to 10 and blow your eardrums out with in public without anyone knowing, look elsewhere. If, however, you are looking for an accurate representation of VOCALS then this pair is perfect for you!</span>

<span>I'm going to start with the cons because there are so few that it's easier to say what these do wrong compared to everything else.<br/><br/>Cons<br/>- no rumbling bass. I personally like this, as I find heavy sub-bass such as in Beats Solo 2 headphones or most other consumer sets to be a bit grating after a while, to the point that I have a headache. These headphones are definitely not for bass-heads in any way. You'll be able to tell the rumble is there, but it's not nearly as prevalent as in other headphones. As a result, if you are a bass-head, you'll probably think these are a bit weak. Instead, you'll be hearing the tone and the notes of the bass a lot more than you would with other headphones in the same price range.<br/><br/>- sound leakage/isolation. These are semi-open headphones, meaning sound can get in and get out easier than in a closed-back headphone. Again, I personally haven't had a problem with this yet, but it does limit where you can use them. I found that 50% volume on my laptop was both perfectly loud enough for the music to ring through with power and clarity, while also not bothering those around me. As for sound coming in, I could hear my parents and the TV, but not enough to make out any words. These allow you to be aware of your surroundings, but at the same time they wouldn't work for a train or air travel, as the lack of noise cancelling allows the sounds of the engines and track to overpower the music.<br/><br/>Pros<br/><br/>- the sound. Thanks to the semi-open design, the highs and mids in these headphones are beautiful. You can see for yourself how the semi-open cups change this by covering them with your hands while you're listening, doing so makes the music a bit more claustrophobic with harsher treble. Everything I've tried with them, whether it be Kendrick Lamar, Dying Fetus, Miles Davis, or Nirvana, has sounded better than I've ever heard. These are designed for studio recording, and as a result have a very flat and even sound that doesn't emphasize any particular frequency. They're bright, but not ear piercing. They have bass, but it doesn't drown out the rest of the music, even on an insanely bass-heavy album like 21 Savage &amp; Offset's "Without Warning." Since these are made for studio recording and production, you'll naturally get as close a sound as possible to how the music is supposed to sound, without modifications to any particular. I've been able to hear details in some songs I had no idea were there, and it's a wonderful experience to relive some of my favorite albums with this more studio accurate sound.<br/><br/>- comfort. These headphones are very, very light, with soft leather cushions and a leather headband. While it's a bit odd for headphones that sound this good to be so light initially, it's actually quite nice and allows for extended listening without discomfort. No adjustment is needed when putting these on; instead of having the locking sections most headphones do for adjusting them, these have springs in the headband. This allows them to fit comfortably by just putting them on, without figuring out exactly where each cup needs to be to make it feel right. I personally found the cups to be big enough for my ears to fit almost completely inside of them, but I've seen some complain that they are too small, so take note of that. One of the other benefits of the previously mentioned semi-open design is allowing some air to come through as well; my ears did not get nearly as hot as they did with Beats or Sony Gold or any other closed back headphones I've used, which is something I have been dying to have for a long time.<br/><br/>- looks. Of course this is completely personal taste. I think these headphones look awesome, but I can understand if someone else doesn't. AKG makes another model that is a bit less retro looking called the AKG M220 which might be more someone's style. They're pretty much the exact same headphones, except with a white and black color scheme and a price point that's about $2 higher than these.<br/><br/>- wire. The wire this thing came with is long, longer than I've seen in most stores outside of Fry's or Best Buy. That works great for me, as I'm going to mainly use these in my dorm where I need to move around. You can also buy a replacement wire if this one isn't long enough that's 25 feet. Speaking of replacement, yes, these headphones have a replaceable wire, meaning it's not really a big deal if the wire breaks. It might be a bit difficult to find a cable for them though, as instead of a normal aux cord, these have a 35mm plug on one end and a mini XLR on the other that plugs into the headphones. It's a stronger fit than other headphones I've used with removable wires, but also a slightly confusing design choice. These also come with an adapter for larger plugs such as those you'd find on the headphone port of a receiver, not something I myself needed but welcome nonetheless.<br/><br/>- price. I got these for around $68, an insanely low price for how good these are. You can easily go over $100, $200, or even $300 to try to find headphones that are better than this, but if you're just looking for something to listen to music or even do some of your own recording, these are perfectly fine. As well, that removable wire and other reviews I've seen from trusted source means these are insanely durable; you may never need to buy another pair of headphones again.<br/><br/>In short, these are the best headphones I have ever come across. The sound leakage and lack of sub-bass could be a problem for some people, but personally they weren't massive enough to bring the score down. If you're on the fence, absolutely get these or their sister product the AKG M220's, you won't regret it. Samson makes a model that is clearly based off of these, and from what I've heard they're slightly heavier on the bass, though I personally went with these because of the removable wire and trust I have with the reviewers that recommended these.</span>

<span>The short and sweet of these phones is they are a really solid cheap option for studio grade flat response phones that are well worth the money and where you should be making your entry into the studio grade space with AKG. Read on for a more detailed review<br/><br/>Testing performed on an SMSL DAC using Optical<br/>Windows 10 at 24 bit 96000Hz Studio quality no enhancements of any kind<br/>Tested using Spotify Premium Quality, Youtube videos, and MusicBee FLAC music, and some Bluray Movies<br/>Compared against Sennheiser HD598 and Pioneer HDJ-1000(for distortion purposes)<br/><br/>So these headphones were a very pleasant surprise for me to give a review. The last “cheap AKG” phones I’ve had any experience with were the K70. Those phones were flat just on the edge of tin like and overall a massive disappointment. I might be considered an “audiofile” by some and would consider my setup to be at the bottom of premium. I normally listen to things on a set of HD598 that I love with everything and an S.M.S.L. DAC connected via SPDIF(optical). So coming into these phones at this price point I was not expecting good things to say the least given my last experience. Turns out I was way off base as these are really solid phones.<br/><br/>So first things first the sound is very neutral which is something I look for in studio grade phones. No bass boosting or extra crystal in the highs. Just nice neutral sound to appreciate the original source material. The sound stage is large but The highs are nice and clear with a little cut off at the peaks. The bass is nice warm and clear if a little flat. Giving a listen to a bass boosted version of Invincible I would have to crank my DAC to a level that on my HD598’s would have my ears bleeding. However there was no distortion or muddling so I would more likely chalk it up to gain hunger for bass than I would weak output. Switching over to a song I know has a lot of highs as well as bass I gave a listen to Ignoring My Heart Bass Boosted. The story was the same. No real distortion happening I could discern a clear difference between the highs and the bass on the drops. I think the lesson here is if you’re wanting a rich thick bass signature out of these phones then you’re going to have to be listening on a dedicated device like a DAC or Audio Interface and not a phone/tablet. Highs I listened to a couple songs that give me a good impression of the highs and their qualities. First off I listened to Jolie Coquine by Caravan Palace. DAC was at the normal level I keep it at this time around and everything from the lyrics to the violins were nice a clear if a bit lacking in the peaks. Next up a gave Beauty Beats by Beats Antique a listen which has the highs more muted but still present in the foreground. It was a much better listening experience here the violins are more in the background while the fiddles are more foreground. Next up I gave Carmina Burana a go particularly the version performed by the London Philharmonic Orchestra. It’s one of the best versions that really shows off highs as well as giving you a solid idea of the sound stage of the phones. This was outstandingly good in terms of the highs but the sound stage was quite lacking here.I would say it's about half as wide as my HD 598's. Last I gave Madame Coquette by Tape Five a listen and noticed the slight cut off in the highs once a gain compared to my 598’s. It’s nothing an average listener would notice or someone who’s more a casual listener would notice but it’s definitely there in the highs Mids songs are always really hard to pick out because I think a huge difference in peoples listening experience comes in at the Mids. So I would use my track list here to find where your listening defaults lie. First off I gave My Kind of Town by Sinatra a listen because with the lyrics and the woods section I think this song has a really solid mid presence throughout. Here’s where I noticed the first bit of the corner cutting that I think gets these phones into the price point they are in. There’s a flatness that isn’t obvious but very pronounced. It sounds like you get to right where a mid would fill your sound stage and it stops just before that. Next up I gave In The Air Tonight by Collins a listen. I think this song is a good choice because the Mids are what I would call the essence of this song. No real issues here this time around and the flatness isn’t as big of a deal here.<br/><br/>Moving on to movies and general video content from the likes of YouTube, Netflix, etc I think this is where the phones really shine. The overall neutral sound signature gives any spoken word content a perfect balance. Everything form YouTube videos to movies to Netflix sounded as good as I expected it to sound. With no real issues or noticeable drops offs of any kind. Everything sounds just right in my book.<br/><br/>So conclusion time is upon us and it’s important that you remember that sound in general is a very subjective medium and it’s hard to just outright say something or give a person a conclusive yes or no answer to a question. All that taken into account are these good headphones? Yes I think the neutral studio sound signature and level detail in the sound is perfect for this price point. If you’re a streamer, gamer, or video watcher then these headphones are hard to beat. If you’re a big music listener or expect booming thunderous sounds then I think you should look elsewhere. I don’t honestly believe you can get a set of headphones that are this comfortable and this quality at this price without a major sale going on at the time. These are a solid buy and a solid 5 star from me.</span>

<span>This review is a review of the AKG K240Ss and the CAD MH310s (I cant speak for the Behringer HA400... but its probably decent)<br/><br/>So I own these AKG K240Ss and the CAD MH310s.  I wanted to compare them for your sake, because bother are AMAZING cans, and both worth more than their prices (I've bought plenty of cans in the past).  Long Story short, the AKGs stand their ground as classics and the CADs bring some seriously cool characteristics as competition.  (buy both lol)<br/><br/>Radiohead: Kid A: Idioteque (non-amped)<br/>AKG: Very neutral, almost completely flat at times.  HUGE sound stage.  Lack of directness and isolation, but it feels like you're there live.  Sounds can sound almost as though they are mechanically created they are so real.<br/>CAD:  Direct, Isolated, Focused.  Bass is heavy, Treble is bright, you couldn't configure an EQ any more suited to the average listener.<br/>Conclusion:  CADs were fun, but you could listen to the AKGs forever and love every second.<br/>Winner: AKG<br/><br/>Radiohead: Kid A: Idioteque (amped)<br/>AKG: Still neutral, but with a bit more punch.  Bass hits are more presence (still not as much as the CAD) and highs have a unique  soft ringing quality.<br/>CAD:  Bass really thumps and the highs shine even more.  There is no way to add more sound stage though, just more of the same (which isn't a bad thing depending on your tastes).  Vocals sounded almost too close to the ear.<br/>Conclusion:  CADs had tons of power but the AKGs were the same terrific cans as before (non-amped) with more punch and presence.<br/>Winner: AKG<br/><br/>NIN: Pretty Hate Machine: That's What I Get (non-amped)<br/>AKG:  Huge sound stage.  Sounds are soft, and at all distances while Trent's vocals are surprisingly present.  Again, certain sounds have the sharpness and craft to appear almost mechanical and not produced by a speaker.<br/>CAD:  Sounds are much sharper and direct.  The bass and treble of the CADs really help in this track, the sound is just... fun.  The quick bursts of silence made a huge impact in contrast with the sharp extremes.<br/>Consclusion:  The CADs just added the punch and frequency dynamics that made the track.  The AGK's sounded live and open.<br/>Winner: CAD<br/><br/>NIN Pretty Hate Machine: That's What I Get (amped)<br/>AKG:  The softness is gone, and AKGs openness and accuracy portrays perfectly this track's abrupt highs and almost mechanical lows (no longer soft, but quite detailed).  Quick silent parts are contrasted with fast paced, abrupt changes.<br/>CAD:  They're loud and direct to a fault, you will not miss a moment.  Bass is big and brooding, but the highs lack the snap that the AKGs had.  Sounds move around quickly on these cans, but always within close proximity.<br/>Conclusion:  The CADs sound powerful and amazing, but you will never forget the hugeness of the AKGs and their absolute authority on this track.<br/>Winner:  AKG<br/><br/>The Dolly Rocker Movement: Our Days Mind The Time: Coffin Love (un-amped)<br/>AKG:  The sound is almost smothering yet without appearing too close... the male and female vocals take the stage and fill your ears beautifully.  Sound stage sounds perfect.<br/>CAD:  Very clear sounding and extremely close proximity.  Sound stage is bigger than usual, but not comparable to the AKG.  Vocals are even more present, and very clear and precise.<br/>Conclusion:  The AKGs are extremely open and lively, while the CADs are a bit too close but amazingly precise.<br/>Winner: AKG<br/><br/>The Dolly Rocker Movement: Our Days Mind The Time: Coffin Love (amped)<br/>AKG:  Blissful openness and naturalness, with tremendous kick and clarity added in.  The AKGs are carry vocal detail and characteristics extremely well here.  Guitar is very pronounced now.<br/>CAD:  Almost overwhelming in its up front characteristics (feels like the singers are two feet from your face).  Like the AKGs, the guitar is also very pronounced now too.  Very amusing listen, but very taxing.<br/>Conclusion:  The CADs sound amazingly up close while the AKGs sound like you're there.<br/>Winner:  Tie<br/><br/>Front 242: Front By Front: Terminal State (un-amped)<br/>AKG:  A very relaxed take on an EBM sound.  Sounds are a bit further than normal, although everything is very present and articulate.<br/>CAD:  Bass and treble have more authority than before.  Sounds are very present and extremely detailed and textured.  For once, sounds almost mechanically produced on the CADs as opposed to the AKGs.<br/>Conclusion:  The AKGs have a distant/softer approach to this track.  The CADs are powerful and in charge.<br/>Winner: CAD<br/><br/>Front 242: Front By Front: Terminal State (un-amped)<br/>AKG:  The softness is gone and it is AKG's signature soundstage coupled with snappy highs and lows which hit hard.  Sounds are extremely detailed and easy to identify and understand.<br/>CAD:  Thumping, authoritative sound.  Right in your face (or your ears) sound with all the bass authority and treble clarity you could want.<br/>Conclusion: The CADs are extremely strong and in charge.  The AKGs are wide open yet precise and very snappy.<br/>Winner:  Tie<br/><br/>Let me just say that neither of these cans are a bad deal by any means.  Let me also say that neither one is better than the other.  In fact, I say, own both, they complement each other extremely well.  If you have to chose one or the other, just keep in mind, AKG = huge sound stage, CAD = powerful and direct.  I will say the CADs are immensely fun and the AKGs are blissful to listen to for long times; and both benefit from an amp (even a cheappo - tried many).  Choose what suits your tastes (or get both).<br/>If you want headphones for: rap, hiphop, industrial, ebm, electronic, etc... choose the CAD<br/>If you want headphones for: new age, rock, alternative, classic, psychedelic, etc... choose the AKG<br/><br/>-but really that's not true... its really sound stage over directness... choose your flavor!</span>

<span>I’ve had these for several weeks and I’m using them extensively today &amp; wanted to leave a review. I bought these for the noise cancellation feature. I do not tolerate ear buds in my ears &amp;  I wasn’t looking for a headset to play music to cover up unwanted noise, I wanted a set to simply block irritating sounds. These have been extremely useful for that with nothing but the noise cancellation feature on. It seems to do very well canceling noises that are just loud enough to set me on edge, but not actual loud noises. Today I was able to use the noise canceling feature alone to block some machine humming and some hammering from the construction site in my neighborhood. I like using this feature alone when I’m working so that I can continue to hear the alerts (albeit muffled) from my computer while still blocking out the excessive noise outside. When I need additional noise filtering, I will add some white noise from my favorite app which completely blocks out any noise that I’ve come across including crying babies, lawn mowers, and loudly arguing neighbors. I also enjoy listening to my podcasts with these &amp; find the sound quality decent, especially for the price. I do find it difficult, but not impossible to sleep with these on. Battery life is great, I’ve charged it just once since getting them. I also like the announcement through the device when you turn it on with the battery level.</span>

<span>Let me start off by explaining my use-case for these headphones.<br/><br/>I was in the market looking for something to be a good accompaniment to my brand new Oculus Quest 2. I planned on sharing the play experience with some friends, so earbuds were out of the question for sanitary reasons. I wasn't looking for stupidly-expensive headphones to have to play some VR games, but wanted something decent so Beat Saber would sound better haha. Previously, I had bought these $15 Panasonic headphones that had banger reviews, but once they arrived, I put them on, turned on some music, and instantly boxed it back up. Trash. So back to Amazon I went to look for something that's more bang-for-your-buck. I stumbled upon a bunch of non-mainstream headphones and then eventually to these. I have some Anker chargers and stuff but I never knew Anker made audio hardware, so I thought I'd read some reviews and try them out since they were on sale for $45 vs. their $60 MSRP. I knew now that if I wanted even the slightest decency in quality, I'd have to spend more than $15 haha.<br/><br/>Next, let me explain my experience in audio hardware.<br/><br/>I wouldn't consider myself a professional audiophile, but I know good sound when I hear it. My most expensive pair of headphones are my Sennheiser HD 650 for when I dabble in music production or want listen to music at the highest quality pair with my FiiO portable amp interface, my pair of Sony MDR-V6 (my favorite pair of headphones/ studio monitors and ol' faithful), Sennheiser CX 5.00i (hands-down best-sounding and most-balanced earbuds), 2 pairs of Sennheiser CX 300 (best-sounding alternative to the 5.00i), Beats Studio (trash), Beats Solo HD (even more trash), airpods 1st gen, and various pairs of earpods lying around. Hopefully that gives you a small glimpse of how much high-quality audio means to me...or how stupid I am for owning a couple pairs of Beats...<br/><br/>NOW FOR THE BREAKDOWN ------<br/><br/>Sound Quality ---- 8/10<br/>These are actually quite above decent! The price is just a bonus. I'd say the quality as normal headphones for listening to music and gaming, they're perfect. Crisp highs and good lows (with a bit of a default bass-enhancement). The mids could use a bit of work but to be honest, for $45 this is prob some of the best sound you can get at this price-point. Pretty much what a lot of these reviews say. Heck, these may be better than/ as good as  most name-brand $100-200. I've used various Bose Quiet Comfort series headphones ($300+) and haven't been impressed with their sound quality. I would say these sound just as good, if not better, than Bose QC headphones, as controversial as that may be to say haha. Another comparison is against my airpods, which I consider pretty good-sounding. I would say these are about the same as airpods, but with added bass and optional added bass on top of that. Beats muddle everything else with their added bass, while these don't IMO. Overall, sound quality on these is solid and for under $60, I would say is a steal.<br/><br/>DO NOT USE FOR MUSIC PRODUCTION OR AS STUDIO MONITORS<br/>I only say this because there are reasons that these are just meant for listening. There are drivers in these that may not sit well with production hardware, such as an amplified audio interface, preamps, or other equipment. When I plugged this into my FiiO via the provided aux cable, the sound became unbalanced. It's probably because it wasn't meant to take in more power than it was built with, so better to leave these headphones vanilla than add anything else to them. Use them for listening or gaming and you should experience optimal sound quality. Oh and also, DON'T EVER BUY BEATS. These headphones sound eons better than any of the Beats products that I've owned/ tried, including the discontinued $400 Beats Pro.<br/><br/>Comfort ---- 10/10<br/>These are also quite comfortable. I've worn it as long as 3-hour time period so far and the sides of my head/ ears weren't sore like after long wears of my Sennheiser HD 650s. Just like my Sony MDR-V6s they are foldable, so that may have something to do with the flexibility of its entirety. My Sennheiser HD 650s are non-foldable, and that's a big drawback for those :'(. The memory foam pads covered with faux leather allows the headphones to comfortably conform to your head shape. The only thing I can really compare the comfort to is the Beats Studio, which surprisingly, despite their build quality, are pretty comfortable. Overall, I feel like these would fit most heads and provide almost universal comfort.<br/><br/>Features ---- meh, not much to talk about<br/>Really the only added features are the optional bass-boost and active noise canceling (ANC). The optional bass-boost isn't bad, it just doesn't do much for me because bass is already enhanced right outta the box. So if you're into bass-boosted and bass-heavy music, these will be quite pleasant for sure! The ANC also doesn't really do much for me since I listen to my music loud enough to drown out pretty much everything anyway. But, when I turn it on without music playing, it does do something. It's not quite as effective as the Bose QC headphones, but I think it works pretty well in most loud situations. I just haven't used it on a plane yet haha. The volume control buttons have an annoying beep every time you press + or - , but whatever. This actually sucks- you can't use the headphones while they're charging, even wired. Ridiculous, I know. But hey, can't have everything, right? Big oof on Anker's end on that.<br/><br/>Aesthetics ---- 6/10<br/>Not gonna lie, these are pretty generic looking headphones. They don't have some revolutionary design to it, but they look like your average good-looking generic headphones. They aren't flashy like Beats or Airpods (or probably the upcoming Airpods Studio) but they don't look bad at all. They're just...normal. But, I did only get the black pair, so maybe the gray one looks better in different settings. Don't let this be a deal-breaker, though.<br/><br/>Connectivity ---- 6/10<br/>Wired, these things are perfect. The provided cable could be longer, but that's nothing against the headphones themselves. Just buy an extender or a longer cable online for like $10 or less. THE ONLY REASON I'M KNOCKING OFF A STAR is because of what a lot of people are complaining about: the choppiness and clicking of the Bluetooth connectivity. Every now and then the headphones will click or have that split-second static noise while I'm listening via bluetooth. It's not often, but happens enough to dock a start off. Now, I could just return these and try to get another pair, but I'm too lazy and don't really care too much about the clipping every now and then, so that's on me. But, it's a problem a lot of other reviewers are complaining about so it's a legitimate issue. The range is fine so far. I've been able to walk 30 ft. away without any clipping issues. I've also used these for video calls and they work just fine with no clipping.<br/><br/>Conclusion ---- Overall grade: 9/10<br/>You may or may not find headphones this great-sounding at this price-point or even a step up in price-point, but then again I haven't tried every single pair of headphones on the market. But I can say with confidence that these stack up pretty well against my studio headphones that I own and I would recommend these to anyone looking for decent-sounding headphones, because with these, you'll get way more than what you're looking for. These will definitely be a pleasure to play VR games with and even moreso just listening to music while at home or traveling!<br/><br/>Now if you're looking for decent earbuds, I recommend the Sennheiser CX 5.00i! (If you haven't noticed, i'm definitely biased towards Sennheiser, but they're industry-standard and the have the best sounding audio products I've ever experience, hands-down)</span>

<span>I'll be quite honest that I first bought these when trying to find one of the cheapest reputable noise cancelling headphones that I planned to use exclusively for mowing.  I have a 3 acre lawn and spend hours mowing each week and the regular headphones just had to be jacked up too loud to hear over the drone so I finally jumped on these.<br/><br/>These headphones have been nothing short of great for me.  I'm sure you'll find plenty of people griping about options that may be missing and no app support and yada yada yada but the truth is, these offer a large amount of bang for the buck.  Noise cancelling and great, but not perfect when comparing to Bose headphones (shocker, right?)  Ears do start to sweat a little after an hour or so but that's not extremely surprising either.  Plenty loud, especially if you turn off the noise cancelling.  Perhaps this is par for the course, but I was slightly disappointed at how much bass you lose when you turn on the noise cancelling.  They actually shocked me at how much bass they have when comparing to other headphones 4 times their price.  I wouldn't go as far as to call them boomy but they do have a good punch.<br/><br/>At the end of the day, i've liked these headphones so much that i've had to keep moving them between the garage and the house as I use them to watch movies late at night when I don't wanna wake the rest of the family up.<br/><br/>They are a great budget friendly pair of noise cancelling headphones with a great battery life.  I'd buy again!</span>

<span>I’ve had these headphones since end of December 2019, gotten for flight over the holidays. Tried out both Bose noice Cancelling headphones at local brick &amp; mortar store, but the price caused me to pause.  On to Amazon where I found these, better price, would arrive before my flight, sounded like a deal worth a shot after reading everything about them what did I have to lose with Amazon’s return policy &amp; Anker’s reputation for quality.<br/>I’ve had great chargers, other electronic items by Anker with great results.  They arrived on time well packaged, impressive from the start, but sound quality sealed the deal.<br/>Back to Anker headphones, I love them! The sound quality is amazing, when I have ANC on I can’t hear anything but music, the outside noise is indeed cancelled. Even on my really bad flight (another story) a guy wanted to test them against his B newest headphones, so we switched for a test. He said he wish he had known about Ankers quality &amp; price, they were impressive not that he would give up the B set, but would definitely buy them as a spare or an extra pair to use for other activities, he couldn’t believe the price.  He went straight to Amazon asked me if the pair he chose were the same as mine, they were &amp; he ordered them. That kind of confirmed I have a great pair of anc headphones &amp; didn’t pay $$$ for them,<br/>They pair easily and are comfortable - until I’ve worn for hours then my shades/glasses are indented in my skull, time for a break, but that’s after hours of wearing-enjoying great sounding music 4-6 hrs &amp; battery is still strong, time fly by.<br/>There are only 2 minor suggestions for Anker regarding these headphones 1) add to Soundcore app please (after thought I don’t know if it’s needed unless to customize equalizer) the volume can be controlled on the headphones.  2) the headband could use a slight redesign.  Wearing them while working out, doing lawn work or inside cleaning, cooking, always moving about  (excellent BT range btw), the top of headband pulls my hair as the headband is adjustable it tends to slide a wee bit &amp; my hair gets pulled  so I have to adjust them &amp; keep going, I’ve no idea how they could do this it’s something I noticed when trying out my son's. He bought a cheap pair of JBL headphones for lawn mowing, they do fit a little better but don’t compare to Ankers sound quality, imho Would love JBL type fit on Anker Life Q20 hybrid ANC headphones!<br/>Taking phone calls while wearing headphones works great, I asked how did I sound, fine he said, then we laughed when I told him I was listening to music on my Ankers when he called &amp; I took the call while wearing my headphones. Neither of us had any problems with quality of call. Volume is easy to find &amp; adjust the multifunction button is easy to use for music or calls.<br/>They come with the charging cable, though I wish more companies included the wall plug in,I don’t always have a spare just ling around, ok so I never have a spare just laying about.  Also the aux cable is included though I haven’t used that feature yet. A drawstring pouch to put them in, which was good as I didn’t have a case to put them in for my flight &amp; no time to get one. Instructions are well written Anker products are always first class<br/>Love these headphones, the ANC &amp; overall sound quality at this price point is a gift that keeps on giving. The quality of this model looks &amp; sounds like the much higher price headphones, maybe better than some.  I wouldn’t hesitate to buy for a gift as they come gift wrap ready or a gift of music for me.<br/>Overall Ankers entry into the headphone, earbud market is welcomed. I wouldn’t hesitate to try them out if you’re looking for headphones with ANC Fantastic sound, that doesn’t break the budget to tears, give them a listen I think you’re going to love them.<br/>Simply put my Anker Life Q20 ANC headphones are fantastic in quality and sound. I’m not an audiophile but I can’t find a thing disappointing in these, not quality or sound.  I like a variety of music &amp; I hear good  bass, mid tones &amp; treble, vocal it’s all there. As said for everything including quality these headphones deliver at a price that doesn’t break the bank &amp; with Ankers outstanding customer service is amazing. I can honestly say Anker SoundCore is definitely impressive, just as their charging cables, &amp; other electronic devices that was my first introduction to Anker products. I’m sure I’ll look at their Bluetooth speakers soon.<br/>Sorry for overly long review, there’s so many outstanding elements that I feel are important for customers to know when spending your money,I try to offer as much info I’ve experienced as possible, I’ve relied on Amazon customer reviews when making a purchase, they’re brutally honest good or bad &amp; I appreciate that.<br/>I’ve had &amp; used these headphones since late 22nd December, tonight is 25 July enough time to really evaluate  them, they’ve exceeded my expectations, I would definitely recommend, most of all I would buy them again.<br/>Thanks if you did read this long review, good intentions to help others as they shop.<br/><br/> UPDATE 12 August a friend of mine used my Ankers while visiting. He called back he had received his very own Anker Life Q 20 headphones.  That says a lot about the sound &amp; quality whilst respecting the customers wallet, he was so happy with his new headphones &amp; that I recommended Ankers.<br/><br/>Thanks again to Amazon shoppers, Amazon &amp; Anker</span>
