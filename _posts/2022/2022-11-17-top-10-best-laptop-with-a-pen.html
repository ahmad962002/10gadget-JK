<span>This laptop is a great buy for the money, especially considering you're getting 16GB of RAM and a 6-core processor. Overall a solid package marred by a few shortcomings that may or may not matter to you.<br/><br/>Pros:<br/><br/>* Price to performance is unbeatable<br/>* Comes with 16GB of RAM (dual channel) when most laptops at this price point only get 8GB<br/>* Very fast processor that handles just about anything you can throw at it<br/>* Pretty good graphics for integrated - lets you play a lot of games at lower settings if that's your thing<br/>* Fairly rigid construction and the plastic has a nice soft coating that feels good in the hand<br/>* Responsive touchpad<br/>* Plush, backlit keyboard with plenty of travel<br/>* 1080p screen is plenty sharp for this 14-inch panel - no issues with reading text or watching videos<br/>* Speakers get loud and are clear until you get super high ( &gt;80% volume)<br/>* Touchscreen works well<br/>* Comes with a free pen (battery included)<br/>* SSD can be replaced in the future if you need more space<br/>* Battery life is respectable - I'd say 7-8 hours if you're surfing the web and watching some youtube videos on a battery-friendly power mode<br/>* Fingerprint reader is fast and pretty accurate (works on the first try 9 out of 10 times)<br/><br/>Cons<br/><br/>* Screen is dim compared to higher-end laptops (or even Intel variants of the same laptop). At 250 nits, you'll likely have no issue using it indoors (which 99% of us are), but know that you will likely have it maxed out all the time, which will impact battery life.<br/>* Plastic build. While the build quality feels solid, it's still not going to be as sturdy/rugged as a metal body. Expect to hear a few tiny creaks and groans here and there if you're moving it around a lot (like using on the couch).<br/>* Heavy if using as a tablet. This is par for the course with most 2-in-1 laptops.<br/><br/>Defects<br/><br/>* My unit came with 1 dead pixel.<br/>* Coil whine. I hesitate listing this as a defect since it's present on most laptops to some degree, but I think it's loud enough to put here. On battery, my unit has a bit of coil whine. It isn't too audible unless I am in a dead silent room. When charging, the coil whine increases to a noticeable volume. Something to consider if you plan on leaving yours plugged in a lot.<br/>* Audio popping. Before and after any sound is played on the laptop (e.g., streaming a video online), I can hear an audible "pop" come from the speakers. It pops once before any sound is played and then pops 2-3 times after the sound is finished playing. It appears to be a driver/Windows power management problem. Essentially, the speakers turn themselves off to save power, so anytime a sound is played, they turn on (causing a pop) and then afterwards turn off (causing a few more). "Just mute the sound" I can hear you say. Doesn't work. Even on mute, the speakers will turn themselves on and off if they think there may be audio on a given web page or application. This results in hearing tiny pops randomly while using the laptop. I spent hours diagnosing and troubleshooting this issue, even going as far as editing the registry. No dice. This appears to be a software issue, but I don't know if this is a Lenovo Windows problem. Either way I have been unable to find a solution that fixes the issue.<br/><br/>Conclusion<br/><br/>I ultimately returned the laptop. If the defects above were not present, I would be typing this review on the Lenovo and be perfectly content knowing that I got a really good deal on what is a very capable machine. I hope the coil whine and audio issues aren't impacting a lot of people who buy this laptop. At the end of the day, I'm just not confident that my luck would change with a replacement unit. I'll likely snag one of the other AMD Ryzen laptops coming out in the latter half of this year.<br/><br/>UPDATE: I found a fix to the audio issue. I'm not 100% on the order of operations, since I changed a lot of things, but if you are experiencing issues, try this:<br/><br/>1. Go to device settings &gt; Sounds, video, and game controllers<br/>2. Select the RealTek audio device and right-click to update the driver<br/>3. Choose browse my computer for drivers<br/>4. Choose let me pick from a list<br/>5. Install the High Definition Audio Device drivers (restart if asked)<br/>6. Go to the registry editor and type "Computer\HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM" into the box at the top. Hit enter.<br/>7.Hit ctrl + f to bring up search and type "PowerSettings" Hit enter.<br/>8. You should end up in a subfolder of 0001 or 0002. Click on the parent folder (the 0001 or 0002 folder) and look at the DriverDesc field. Find the one that says "AMD High Definition Audio"<br/>9. Now go to the PowerSettings subfolder for that one.<br/>10. Modify the "ConservationIdleTime" file to be all zeros: (00 00 00 00) and click OK.<br/>11. Audio issue should be fixed now, but restarting the laptop is a good idea.<br/>12. I then went online and downloaded the latest AMD drivers. Just google "amd ryzen 5 4500u drivers"  and it should be the first results. Click Drivers and Support at the top of the page and download the software.<br/>13. Restart the laptop after installing the AMD updated software.<br/><br/>Hope this helps someone.<br/><br/>In light of this, I am ordering a replacement unit to see if I can get one without dead pixels and coil whine. Leaving rating at 3 stars since no one should have to go through all this with a brand new machine.<br/><br/>UPDATE 2: Happy to say the replacement unit has no dead pixels and much reduced coil whine. Will be keeping it. The audio popping issue was still present, so it does appear to be a driver issue. Did the same fix as the first unit and seems fine now. Hopefully future drivers will fix it for good.</span>

<span>For a lightweight, 2-in-1, powerful laptop for $600, it's a steal:<br/>2-in-1 form factor.<br/>4500U 6 core<br/>16GB of 3200mhz ram<br/>Vega graphics<br/>Backlit keyboard<br/>Fingerprint scanner<br/>Free Digital pen<br/>USB-C Charger<br/><br/>I like it:<br/><br/>The 4500U cpu?  It's amazing!  This budget laptop underdog meets or beats my desktop i7 4790K at any metric.  That's a legendary, mainstream flagship, 4/8 gaming processor from 2014. It's astonishing what this budget laptop CPU can do. It powers through web browsing tabs effortlessly and opens zipfiles rapidly.<br/><br/>The screen looks really nice for a lower tier laptop. It's IPS so the angle views look great, the colors also seem decent and vivid right out of the box and the brightness is reasonable.  Compared to my high end, $1k, IPS HDR, full color gamut gaming monitor, it doesn't look bad at all.<br/><br/>The case/body doesn't look budget or feel budget to the touch.  It also feels sturdy and solid as you open and close it or type on it. It also has a relatively thin bezel around the screen, giving it a more premium look.  The keyboard feels pretty good too.  On the laptop scale, I'd call it middle of the road.  There are two levels of backlighting. The free digital pen is a neat addition, but I've only begun to play with that. It takes one AAA battery that is also included.  (isn't that nice)<br/><br/>The speakers, for a laptop, sound good.  It does not sound completely tinny and hollow. There is actually a bit of range and clarity and even a hint of bass. They get reasonably loud and don't seem to distort at 100%.  Like the keyboard, I'd put these laptop speakers somewhere in the middle of the laptop sound range.<br/><br/>While this is by no means a gaming laptop, if you are trying to squeeze as much gaming into the basic laptop budget as you can, this little PC does admirably. It's pretty incredible how well this does with no dedicated video card.  It's almost as fast as my 2016 i5 laptop with a GeForce 940MX is for gaming. Just about ~10% slower.  With no video card! This is a lot better than any of the Intel UHD620 gaming numbers.  Enough so that a whole new class of gaming is actually doable on this "regular" laptop.<br/><br/>It does get a little warm with intensive gaming. Under a really heavy load, CPU gets to 70 degrees and spikes up to the 80s. But this is only when you are really pushing the gaming limits. On that note, after 5 minutes of CPUZ stress testing, it sits at 85 degrees. The laptop could get uncomfortable if you actually had it on your lap.  Not crazy hot but a bit warm.  For less taxing games, it barely breaks a sweat.  The fan really isn't all that loud under load either.  It can be heard, but that's about it.  I use "Open Hardware Monitor" to monitor temps, clock speeds and ram usage.<br/><br/>Upgrading the small nvme drive and wifi card looks to be a piece of cake with this unit.  Many laptops that give you no access panels have a scare factor in opening up the whole case.  This one though, it has a removeable bottom that is almost completely flat and not molded into the sides, as many others are.  It makes re-assembly a breeze and chances are you won't break anything or end up with any new creaking sounds.  Make sure you have a (tiny) torx bit set if you plan to open it.  The ram is soldered in but at least it's 16gb and not just 8.<br/><br/>Benchmarks:<br/>SSD speed: Max Write: 994MB/sec // Max read: 2.20GB/sec<br/>CPUZ benchmark - 489 / 2678<br/>Cinebench 15 - 890 // 54.9 FPS<br/>Cinebench 20 - 2245<br/>V-RAY 4.1 - 4990 // 27<br/>Skydiver - 9565<br/>Unigine Superposition - 1715 (default setting) [13 FPS avg]<br/>Unigine Valley - 1457 (basic 720p setting) [35 FPS avg]<br/><br/>Game FPS:<br/>CS:GO [max settings, 1080p] avg 46//low 29<br/>Super Mega Baseball 3 [max settings,1080p] avg 45//low 32<br/>Insurgency [max settings,1080p]  avg 51//35<br/>STALKER - SOC [max settings, 1080p] avg 50//low 29<br/>Civilization VI bench [low settings,1080p] avg 58//low 45<br/>Civilization VI - Average turn time: 7.84 seconds (!)<br/>Assassin's Creed Oddysey bench[low settings,720p] avg 33//low 17<br/>The Witcher 3 [low settings,720p] avg 35//low 27<br/><br/>What I don't like:<br/><br/>-The 256GB SSD is half of what it probably should be and a quarter of what I "need".  Being replaced with a 1TB ($110) along with the outdated wifi/BT card ($20).<br/>-The memory card slot is the archaic shallow style, 2/3 of an inserted SD card sticks out.<br/>-No dedicated volume control on edge of unit.<br/>-It has a useless legacy charging port and they do not send that type of charger. So, the power cord is not connected at the corner where it "should" be, it's connected 1/3 of the way down the body at the USB-C port.<br/>-One USB-C port and it's occupied by the power cord.<br/>-Only 2 full size, USB ports.<br/>-In tablet mode, there are no mini rubber feet on the keyboard side so instead, it just sits on the entire face when laid down.  Could get scratched easy and it completely blocks the speakers.<br/>- The keyboard backlighting, when it's dormant/off, the keyboard does not sense you hovering over it to light the keys back up prior to touching them (like some can).  You need to move the mouse/pad or touch a key to get it to light back up.<br/>-Waking from sleep mode (so far once), the CPU would not clock back up above 400mhz, all 6 cores.  It's like it got stuck in a low power mode.  Restarting resolved it but something to watch for if the system acts suddenly anemic.<br/><br/>Overall, this is a really good 2-in-1 laptop. It just needs a bigger drive to make it a great budget powerhouse / light gamer. For this price, it's hard to find any deal breaking complaints.</span>

<span>First off, this computer is pretty great. It's fast, has good storage, I like the trackpad, it's got decent sound, and decent brightness for indoor use only.<br/><br/>However like most laptops, it seems like finding the perfect one can be tricky. I went through three. It's not a "Lenovo" problem or this particular model problem, so much as a laptop problem. I've had the same issues with multiple brands.<br/><br/>The first one had screen separation at the top left corner. It popped out of the case. It seems like this isn't the sturdiest design in that regard, but we'll see. Returned.<br/><br/>The second one had funky colors and did not get bright enough. I tried calibrating the colors for hours. Nothing worked. Everything was just off and the screen didn't get as bright as my first one did. Returned.<br/><br/>The third one I bought used. At this point I was done with paying the full price, but I liked the computer if I could just find a good one. This one isn't perfect either, it has the right side of the screen slightly darker than the left side. I'm sensitive to these things and I can notice. Some people won't or can't. Probably a bulb out. But I bought this at a great price used so I'll live with it. This one also had a sound issue. It just wasn't loud enough. But, it turns out this was a result of a bad reset and not the PC itself. A proper reset restored the sound.<br/><br/>FOR THOSE HAVING LOW SOUND:<br/><br/>Click on the windows button at the bottom left of your screen. Scroll and make sure "DOLBY" is an option to click on. It wasn't for mine. I had to reset my computer fully and then the drivers I needed were installed and the sound is much better. If it is there, then sorry can't help you.<br/><br/>I know I'm sounding really negative, but I feel it's important to know possible defects when you are paying this much money. I'm happy with my laptop, I think it's pretty amazing and I have no other complaints.<br/><br/>PROS:<br/>The sound is good for a laptop. It's not great, but it does the job. Make sure Dolby drivers are installed.<br/><br/>The brightness is good for a laptop. It's not great. You won't be able to use it outdoors very well but indoors it has good brightness.<br/><br/>It's fast. It loads up in mere seconds. It takes having several browser tabs and programs open to see a slowdown. But my use is not very typical, I really put it to the limits. Resetting the browser fixes any slowdown.<br/><br/>Battery is good. I can get a few hours out of it. But I don't use it off battery very much.<br/><br/>Back lit key board is great. Nice large keys. No 10 key though.<br/><br/>Trackpad is fine. I recommend disabling everything except two finger scrolling. Settings. Devices. Trackpad. Turn off everything else.<br/><br/>No Graphics card so this is no gaming PC but it will play your non next gen games well enough on low settings.<br/><br/>Solid build for the most part, but be on the look out for screen separation.<br/><br/>Comes with a neat pen. These sell for at least $30 bucks individually. But I won't personally use it, but I could always sell it if I wanted.<br/><br/>Not too heavy, but too heavy to use this as a tablet where you have to hold it in your hands. It has a massive battery and batteries have a lot of weight. But, flipping it and sitting it up to use it as a tablet works.<br/><br/>For the price the specs and features are great. Just be aware that this sells on Amazon occasionally new for $599. Just keep an eye on it and you might get lucky, Amazon lists a few for that price now and again. They also sell used units for even less than that if you are patient.<br/><br/>CONS<br/><br/>It's important to make sure your PC has no defects.<br/><br/>Could be louder, could be brighter, like most laptops.<br/><br/>Comes only with a USB C charger and not a separate charger, which means you can't use the USB C port other than to charge the computer unless you buy another charger.<br/><br/>Check for screen separation.<br/><br/>Colors and brightness seem hit and miss.<br/><br/>No new wifi 6. Just the standard wifi 5. The wifi card just isn't that great. If you are a decent distance from the router, do yourself a favor and buy a wifi 6 card for less than $20 on Amazon (You also need a wifi 6 router). It's pretty easy to install, just youtube the directions. You can do it in 10 minutes.</span>

<span>This laptop is a fine laptop at the price under $600.  Mostly good because of its utility as a two-in-one.  The keyboard is more mushy than a 13" Macbook Air 2020 M1 -- which is not so good, but it is useable since dealing with a 14" class computer body.<br/><br/>And of course, this is the 4500u Ryzen 5.  So, this review has a timeframe of usefulness -- for if one is buying a 4500u when other competitors have some fancier better, then, thing such should be considered on whether a given price is good.<br/><br/>Being a MacBook Pro i9 user, an Mac Air 2020 M1 user, a Pop!_OS user, and a Microsoft Windows 10 user, I can say for following:<br/>1.) General browsing as a laptop -- Mac Air 2020 M1 is best.<br/>2.) Using as a tablet -- this Windows is the best.  But, windows has a poor font experience.  Reading on this is good enough -- though the lack of a bright screen is annoying.<br/>3.) Most reasonable user interface goes to Pop!_OS though not as glitch free as MacOS.  (MacOS M1 has bugs and fails to have a good way of install GNU/Emacs.)<br/>4.) Best for programming and text editing -- Pop!_OS.<br/>5.) Best as a laptop -- Mac Air 2020 M1.<br/>6.) Best trackpad  -- Mac Air 2020 M1, though I'd think System76 has some better track pads than what I've experience with Pop!_OS nowadays.<br/><br/>More cons than pros, but it is really the question of price.<br/><br/>Pros:<br/><br/>* Gaming is OK.<br/><br/>* Windows Subsystem for Linux Works Well making the computer more useable for those who think with pipes.<br/><br/>* Sufficient RAM for most daily tasks.<br/><br/>* Most days the CPU is snappy.<br/><br/>* The ability to use the computer also as a tablet is a huge reason to buy this computer -- especially for reading technical books with graphs.<br/><br/>* Microsoft Whiteboard is a program that works well for productivity on this computer with the Active Pen.  Buy only the Ryzen version of this because the Intel is supposedly slower, based on a review I watched, and doesn't come with active pen.  But, even so, the Intel version may be what you want for a cooler laptop.  It is your decision.<br/><br/>* Good fingerprint reader.<br/><br/>* Takes advantage of new function key layouts for Microsoft Windows.<br/><br/>* Physical camera shutter, potentially for more privacy.<br/><br/>* Keyboard may be lit with the Fn-Space.  A few white-light levels.<br/><br/>Cons:<br/>* Bloatware -- Anti-virus trail with insulting text promoting Fear Uncertainty and Doubt over just using the Anti-virus that comes with Windows 10.  Just uninstall the McCaffery bloat.<br/><br/>* Adware -- Lenovo promotes buying more of their products in Windows Notifications and Toasts.  Crap move Lenovo.<br/><br/>* Keyboard keys reflect CFL lights in such a way that they are hard to read at night -- making programs that allow one to spell check a word with CTRL-. very difficult to use (Typical Spell checker in Microsoft Visual Studio Code.)<br/><br/>* Arrow keys have a poor design for editing text -- page up and page down are on the minuscule up and down arrow keys.<br/><br/>* Oddly had to reset my pin for no reason<br/><br/>* Buggy transitions to tablet mode -- if done when not logged in sometimes doesn't register the change.<br/><br/>* Active pen takes up both USB type A ports.<br/><br/>* Power cord takes up the other, and only, USB, type C, port.<br/><br/>* Has an additional barrel jack Power inlet, but no way to use it.<br/><br/>* Can run warm, but tolerable.  Even when doing not much more than typing or reading a Kindle Cloud reader based book.<br/><br/>* Sound is OK-ish.<br/><br/>* Battery life is ho-hum.<br/><br/>* Computer doesn't actually ever turn off when asking it to.  Instead, it will eat up battery in hibernate mode.<br/><br/>* "Fn" key needs to be processed to enable keys such as F1, F2, F3, F4, &amp;etc.  This is odd since now to close a program it is Fn-Alt-F4 which is bad ergonomics.  Though one can lock the function key mode with Fn-ESC as a toggle not unlike the Caps Lock -- So, perhaps more of a Ah-ha.<br/><br/>* Yucky feel of the keys and trackpad -- the keys have an odd friction, but are OK.  The trackpad is not comforting.<br/><br/>* Lacks hardware cut off for Microphone.<br/><br/>* Lacks a hardware cut off to forbid BIOS updates.</span>

<span>I wasn't keeping my hopes up after seeing some reviews. I wanted a good 2-in-1 that I could use for teaching, working and reviewing work; that would also be at an acceptable price point. This is basically the best rated laptop of its kind at its price point. Some of the reviewers here mentioned that their units had problems, and checking mine with a critical eye, I can definitely see what they mean. The screws in the back have a dark finish on them that strips off when they have been unscrewed.<br/>This unit has been opened, and the original parts have been changed. By my appreciation, this is not wholly a bad thing, however, they forgot to put a screw back, broke off the screw support on one side by tightening the screw too much, and over tightened another one to a point where the unit was being deformed.<br/>The LENOVO warranty shows it only has 1 month left of service in a 12 month plan; which simply shows me that this article was originally bought 11 months ago and then had its internals replaced. I'm guessing the warranty is voided. I feel that enough problems are present for me to justifiably open a return process, however, I ordered this unit while on a business trip to the US so there is no practical way to have the return done. I resorted to fixing the issues myself.<br/>Besides the choddy work on replacing the included RAM and SSD, everything else is very good on this laptop.<br/>I was worried the screen would not be bright enough (based on some reviews), however it seems great. The speakers sound nice, the keyboard feels nice and silent. The included pen works really well with the touchscreen, and the build quality of the laptop itself feels awesome.<br/>I love the size and form factor, and when the computer is folded into a tablet it is really practical for pdf reading and reviewing. I teach online, and MS Whiteboard works really well with the touch screen and digital pen to show calculations and illustrate my lectures with drawings.<br/>The battery seems to last a good amount as well, I havent tried letting it run all the way down yet to check if its time estimates are accurate during my work day, but if I had to judge it on how it has performed thus far, it seems that the battery is doing well.<br/>Overall i'm not lowering the score to less than 4 stars because the laptop itself is freaking awesome. Just be wary of the seller. They really need to work on their attention to detail; but I will also admit that this was the cheapest seller for this configuration of laptop by a good $40-$60... So I guess in a way I'm getting what I paid for: A good laptop that has been upgraded with good parts by a subpar technician.</span>

Includes the stylus pen.  16GB of DDR4-2666 SDRAM of fast memory and a Western Digital 1TB SSD mated to a Fast 10th generation i7-10510U (1.8 GHz base frequency, up to 4.90 GHz) make this a really fast computer.  It even has the latest AX Wireless card.  There are a lot of different i7's being sold and make sure you are getting one with real performance.  This one has a faster base and boosted speed than most.  It also works the faster DDR4-2666 memory.  Some 89still selling the only 8th gen i7 and those use slower DDR4-2400 memory.<br/><br/>I have purchased a couple other laptops and they were slower than my current laptop even though the specs indicated they should have been faster.  So I am happy I finally have one that is actually quicker than my old one.  I am a Network Professional and also build custom Desktops for friends and family, so I know what makes a good system.  This one is a combination of good components and priced under $1,000<br/><br/>I price compared everywhere, Newegg, Best Buy, MicroCenter, HP, Lenovo, Dell and no one could touch this Deal from Amazon "Best Laptop".  Highly recommend this product and seller<br/><br/>A side note, the 4 year protection plan at only $149 was a bargain too.  That is only $35 a year.  I normally pass on these, but this was very inexpensive.  HP wanted $349 for only 3 years.<br/><br/>In conclusion, buy this PC and you'll have a very good experience.  I did!</span>

<span>After spending alot of time researching many different chromebooks, tablets and laptops in the $200-500 that would best suit my needs I found myself getting frustrated and overwhelmed by the process and was about 30 seconds from giving up and settling on one that was not ideal just to get the process over with. That is when this beauty miraculously appeared! Not only did it check 9 out of 10 of the boxes I needed it to, it was also 1/2 the price compared to others I researched in this category.  I love the design and versatility of having a laptop and tablet in one option.  I also like that unlike some of the other 2 in 1 chromebooks it is not flimsy and they clearly took into consideration the lifestyle needs of a 2 in 1 chromebook keeping it lightweight yet very sturdy. The battery life is wonderful, it charges quickly and a full charged has lasted me over a full day at work as I used it continuously for a total of 10.45hrs before it got down to the red at 15%. And that was without turning on the battery saver option! The display is clean, crisp &amp; vivid. Whether it's used for streaming a movie or creating a new document, you will be satisfied with the visuals for sure. Set up was a breeze as was learning the ins and outs of all this chromebook offers. The only "complaint" I have in regards to this specific model is the lack of protective cases designed to fit it. I understand this is not a issue about the product itself but I did want to make people aware of it as there is only 1 brand of hard cover cases that fit it and do not have to be removed for use(mCover hard shell case for 12.2in Samsung v2 chromebook).<br/>I highly recommend also using a padded waterproof shock absorbent carry case as well for travel, as the hard case is mainly to protect from scratches and dings and WILL NOT protect it in the event it is dropped, banged or similar.  The other recommendation is a 9H screen protector, especially if you plan to use the touch screen and stylist pen options. If I could give it 10stars I would.  Hands down this is the best purchase I have made this year, I only wish I found it sooner!</span>

<span>I like this computer.<br/><br/>I received it yesterday and spent the entire evening getting used to it. The laptop comes with a stylus, and a power cable. I think it's made of plastic but it feels pretty solid, and it's way heavier than I expected. I fear I may drop it because of it's weight. Out of the box it has no power, you must plug it in to the wall with your provided cable.<br/><br/>Some issues are that there is one dead pixel that has been present ever since I turned on the device. I don't really care for it as it's so tiny, but I know that some may not be okay with it for it appears to be an irremovable speck of dirt. Another issue is that the stylus has a bit of delay. Another is that the scrolling is a bit wonky in Android apps, I can not use two fingers on the mouse pad to scroll in the Discord app for example, but I can use the pen/my finger to operate it from the screen as I would on my phone. This makes sense since it is an Android app after all, but it'd be nice to not have to switch back and forth from laptop to pen abilities. The app drawer is only properly functionable when using the pen or your finger.<br/><br/>I fell asleep with it the laptop on, and woke several hours later. My battery did not empty in my absence of activity, and none of my progress was lost. Though it did not lock my screen, but I am pretty sure I can fix that in the settings. I am just amazed that it did not die and nothing was lost even though I left it for several hours. The laptop is also extremely quiet I now realize, I have not heard a single mechanical noise coming from it and I am typing this from a silent room.<br/><br/>Also, Chrome OS isn't that bad, I had planned to attempt to download Ubuntu on it, I am still going to get it to have more useful software available, but I will also use Chrome OS since it's not as bad as I thought it would be.<br/><br/>Overall the computer is pretty epic</span>

<span>The touch screen works fine, and I haven’t had any major problems with the laptop OTHER THAN I think it may have been used before?<br/>From the first time I turned it on, it was huffing and puffing like it had asthma. Additionally, it started making a strange popping noise from the inside upon booting it up. I’ve had the laptop for a couple months now, and these issues have not gotten better. I’m concerned there may be internal damage, but I didn’t purchase the warranty or additional protection so I think I’m probably SOL on that. Other than the internal issues- it works great! The touch screen works great with the ~$20 pens on Amazon, but you have to make sure you turn the palm detection on. I take notes on it almost everyday- if it ever gives out, I will make sure to update this review. (Note to those interested, the keys are not backlit!) It’s sleek!</span>

<span>UPDATE: it’s been less than 2 months and one of the fans has broken on its own. It over heats and won’t stay on. Maybe I just have bad luck,  but I wouldn't recommend this laptop.<br/>Original:<br/> I have had this laptop for less than a week. During this time, it has been inside of a protective case, or safe on top of a desk. I opened my laptop today to find screen damage! An inch long hair-like strand of dead pixels for no reason. This seems strange to me as I haven’t done anything to cause such damage, and this being a touch-screen/convertible screen laptop, you think they would have reinforced it a bit? Performance-wise, it’s great, so I’m sad something like this has happened.</span>

<span>I just received the laptop yesterday so I am only reviewing what I have seen up to this point.<br/>Be aware that a lot of the features listed on this Amazon listing are FALSE.<br/>- RAM is 8GB, NOT 12 GB (says 8GB in the listing title but 12 GB under Product Information)<br/>- SSD is 512, NOT 256<br/>-There is NO fingerprint scanner (despite the video in the listing saying that there is. But if you look at the other images, there isn't a finger print scanner. Very inconsistent)<br/>-The inside of the laptop is BLACK, NOT silver<br/><br/>Not all of these are negatives; I like black better, I didn't want a fingerprint scanner, and 512 SSD is definitely better than 256. However, the 8GB instead of 12 GB is a let down for me. Its disappointing that I spent days comparing laptop specs to ensure I got exactly what I wanted, and to find out I was comparing incorrect information. Amazon, HP.... You need to do better.<br/>Side note, the listing and the box for the laptop say its 14-dw1024nr but under computer properties, it -says 14-dw1xxx. I was wondering if this is why there are inconsistencies: its not the same laptop as advertised. Maybe I'm wrong, just a theory.<br/><br/>Moving on.<br/><br/>BATTERY LIFE<br/>Battery life is a significant improvement from my previous device (Microsoft Surface Go). I haven't payed too much attention to how long I get for battery use, but I will update my review and include that information later on.<br/>KEYBOARD<br/>Keyboard has a nice feel to it. My only issue is that when typing, if you rest your palms too heavily on the laptop to type, it causes the cursor to move to usually the beginning of your sentence so when you type, your words go to the wrong place. This is very frustrating as it makes typing take longer and its tedious having to go back and correct my typing over and over again.<br/>MOUSEPAD<br/>Mousepad is fine. My only issue is that right-clicking isn't the most responsive and can be a little frustrating having to push down harder on the mousepad to get a right-click to work.<br/>DISPLAY<br/>This brightness at 100% was nowhere near as bright as my Surface Go. This is honestly disappointing to me. The screen is fine until you want to watch Netflix and its a night scene with mostly dark scenes. Its harder than usual to make out the scene. Other than that, the screen is okay. Not bad.<br/>SPEED<br/>The laptop is much faster than my Surface Go, so I'm very pleased with the speed.<br/>STYLUS<br/>A stylus is not included. I have my stylus from my Surface Go and it works well with this laptop. No issues. I'll include a picture of my doodles with it. This is an important feature for me because I'm a college student and need to be able to take and submit my written digital notes. Can't complain.<br/>HEATING<br/>Something I noticed immediately upon setting up and using the laptop is the fact that it heats up very fast. It gets hot quickly but it also cools itself down quickly. But again, it gets hot quickly so the fan is on and off and on and off. House temp is 73 degrees.<br/><br/>Overall, its not a bad laptop. The fact that the information in the listing is incorrect is very disappointing and is why I deducted 1 star from an otherwise, in my opinion, 5-star laptop. I think the battery life could be better and the overheating isn't great but they are both very manageable. I am very satisfied with the laptop. Just be aware of what you're buying!</span>

<span>This Chromebook is perfect for my husband. He only uses it to browse the web. He doesn't play games or do email and therefore exactly what he wanted including the price! He loves the touch screen &amp; tablet option!</span>

<span>HP Chromebook X360 Model 14b-ca0010nr. If you're cheap like me and take FOREVER to upgrade things because, "Hey, the old one works perfectly fine (although it's slower than snot and your kids say, "Hey mom, you're laptop is a POS!") Awesome HP Chromebook X360 for the price (snagged at $300)!  Totally suitable for the average surfer, email checker, movie watcher. NOTE: There are several variations of this same Chromebook that look nearly identical but are very different!  This WHITE keyboard one gives it away that it's the cheaper model! This one (14b-ca0010nr ) is not the higher end one, does NOT come with stylus pen and does NOT have backlit keyboard, has 4GB RAM vs. 8GB. Chromebooks DO NOT have Windows 10 (Word, PowerPoint, Excel - but you can still work with &amp; save these files in your Google Drive), so keep that in mind - It's an App-based system with internet &amp; keyboard vs. a traditional PC laptop or Netbook. Still, I absolutely LOVE this thing!  It's beautiful! Nice size 14" screen, quiet (no fan, like in a PC), easy to transition to (especially if you already have a gmail account), user-friendly, a cinch to set up - took me less than 30 mins.  Only drawback I can see down the line is the white keyboard might get grungy (get a keyboard skin for around $12.)  Another NOTE:  I have an ancient printer that is NOT wireless and it won't work with it.  Most wireless ones will work, but check to make sure your printer is supported before purchasing! Highly recommend transitioning from a Windows based PC to a Chromebook for the speed and ease of use! Go watch a couple of ChromeUnboxed YouTube guy videos and then Buy it, already! UPDATE Aug 1, 2020: You can get the all white one now for $260!</span>

<span>For $250 (on sale), I'm quite happy with this purchase, which replaces my higher end Lenovo Chromebook (stolen by my son for use in high school). My one disappointment is the quality of the display colors, which are a bit washed out. But for $250, I can live with the screen.</span>

<span>I’ve had this laptop just over a year now. It has been serviced at least 4 times for major issues and I don’t even use it very often. There is always something that is broken with it and Lenovo support is terrible. I have gone through 2 of the lenovo yoga laptops in the past 3 years. I will not be purchasing another one. I may now have to make the switch to Mac.</span>

<span>Updated review:  After a couple of weeks it wouldn't even turn on anymore.  Called lenovo and they had us reset it and that did nothing so they sent out a tech (at no cost to us because it is inside of their warranty period).  Turns out it was the motherboard that was bad... must have been damaged in shipping.  Once the board was replaced it has run flawlessly since.<br/><br/>Original review:<br/>Bought this product (off of lenovo's website) because of its specs as a gift for my girlfriend who just got into nursing school. This review will be from our first impressions and first 3 days of ownership. Its not a pretty picture...<br/><br/>First the positives: Its light weight, fast for common tasks (mostly due to the m.2 drive and 16gb of ram I'd wager), and the 4k screen is very nice for both brightness and quality of image. It can even play games (albeit at 1080p not 4k but if you expect a 2lb laptop with integrated graphics to game at 4k you probably expect politicians to be honest too). At 1080p medium settings, it manages to hold 30-50fps in "7 days to die". The pen seems very accurate and handwriting with it and using it as a mouse is simple and intuitive. The sound is way better than you'd expect for such a tiny laptop and the fact that the speaker is in the hinge means it still sounds great in tablet mode too.<br/><br/>As for the drawbacks there are some serious ones. Upon getting the device and getting it set up my girlfriend went to youtube to watch a video and the thing froze up and black screened. When she tried to open task manager or hit esc nothing happened. Power it off and back on and it comes up to a bit locker recovery screen. Cant find the bitlocker key so she calls lenovo. They tell her to use a pin and reset the thing. Nothing. "Are you sure you put the pin in the right hole? lets try it again." Reset laptop again. still didnt fix the problem. repeated a 3rd time. still didnt fix it. After an hour on the phone the tech says call microsoft. Girlfriend goes to microsoft's website on her phone, "all of our technical support is now online please use our website". Eventually finds the bitlocker key on her own and puts it in. Its a 48 digit code to access her own laptop that she just wanted to reboot because it locked up. This is a terrible idea to enable... ever. Why is it on by default?! I disabled bitlocker and now at least when she has to reboot it that way its just her normal windows pin to get into it. I try using it and it seems to work ok till I go to lenovo's own website and run a scan for problems and it locks up doing that. Go back after restarting and try to scan again to replicate the problem and the scan runs fine. At this point Im thinking its a thermal issue so we put it on her targus laptop cooler from her old laptop. It immediately black screens as soon as we plug it in. Unplug it, restart, plug it back in, black screen again. Get rid of the cooler and just run it on the desk for hours playing 7 days no problem. Go to run netflix app from the start menu, black screen. Reboot, run netflix again, runs for 4 hours straight no problems. At this point I'm thinking its a ram issue but I cant take the ram out because lenovo has so graciously soldiered it to the F'ing motherboard! I could swap the hard drive out but there's no recovery usb included to restore the system should you have to or want to upgrade the drive. I guess if you want any sort of service after your first year you have to pay lenovo because they do not make it easy to fix it yourself.<br/><br/>Conclusion... maybe we got a lemon... maybe its a design flaw. Either way dont buy this laptop unless you just love looking at the windows startup screen.</span>

<span>I ordered it from Happy Ranger and it showed up today. While opening it I found stickers torn from the interior boxes and dust on the thin cover. It appeared as if someone had opened it and re closed it. But I thought this is probably nothing. And opened the laptop screen... it said it was in recovery mode and had failed. Upon restarting it got stuck in the Cortana intro screen and would not move past that.<br/>At that point I gave up and repackaged it for return. Just dropped it off at UPS.</span>
