<span>As with most things 3m makes, this is a good product.  These aren't fancy.  They aren't made of Adamantium or Mahogany.  Thats not to say they look terrible, but they were not made with appearance as the first consideration.  Many products are made that way, which is why products like this stand out.  Those products are designed to do a job related to aesthetics.  This is designed to do a job related to monitor height.  Which is why this is a better product if what you want to be able to do is adjust the height of your monitor.<br/><br/>It comes with a black base, and 4 'legs'.  Each leg is itself comprised of three stackable pieces.  Each stackable piece adds around 2 inches to the height of the stand.  For instance, I currently have one piece for each leg.  Where the stand meets the monitor base is about 2 and a half inches from the table.  I haven't tried just putting the stand tray on the table without any legs, but it looks like that would sit as flat as the table its on would allow.<br/><br/>So maybe the only thing to note is that because the pieces are 2" each, that is what increments you can adjust in.  This doesn't have really granular fine tuned adjustments.  But you're paying $30.  That doesn't buy mechanics or gears or whatever that will do that job and hold up for years.<br/><br/>As said above, it's not made of any premium or fancy material, but it does seem sturdy.  Not a perfect analogy material or construction wise, but think about legos.  You can stack those, pull them apart, kick them around, and step on them for years without making a mark.  I expect these will maintain their form and function for years.  The plastic won't bend or change shape.  Nothing will sag or become uneven.  The pieces will fit together smoothly as long as you dont actively try to alter points where they meet.<br/><br/>As an added bonus, from the inside of one leg to the inside of the other leg is around 10 or 11 inches, so even if it isn't an ideal storage spot, it returns some extra desk room of sorts.<br/><br/>I bought two of these larger stands  for my two 23" monitors to be sure the stand was big enough.  It turns out I shouldn't have been concerned.  There is several inches of tray on either side of the monitors base.  Anything that will accidentally knock them off these stands, would knock them off of anything.  They aren't even close to hanging over the edges.</span>

<span>I bought 2 of these to use at work for my 2 monitors. After relocating from one company building to another, my original monitors didn't follow me, just the hard drive. My monitors are now mismatched and only one is able to raise up to sit at eye level, the other monitor will not stay raised up due to a missing piece that holds it up. These monitor stands work great. I love the fact that they are adjustable by adding or removing sections of the legs, almost like Lego blocks. Even fully extended my monitors sit much higher on the stands than they did on their own, which is a plus for me. I don't get neck aches or migraines as much now that I'm not having to look down at my monitors. The stands are a pretty sturdy plastic, hold up under the weight of the monitors which can be pretty heavy for their size. The stands aren't too bulky either, they fit right under the monitors and may only stick out a few inches in the front which gives me a place to keep my handy office supplies within reach. I even like that the legs are completely removable so the stands are easier to pack up if I have to move desks or locations again. Looking for extra space to store office supplies, the space under the stands is a great area for additional storage of printer paper or files.</span>

<span>This little stand is simple yet sturdy. With a tiny desk at home, this holds an Epson ET-3760 printer, leaving space underneath to slide under my 15" laptop when not being used.  This way I still have desk surface for writing. I'm quite pleased with the stand. It has rubber feet which grip the desk surface well so there is no sliding around with vibrations of the printer.<br/><br/>I had considered the larger version of this 3M Stand thinking there should be a bit of extra space beyond the footprint of the printer, but I am glad I got this one which holds the printer securely while taking up no additional space.</span>

<span>Directions were easy to follow. I mounted the arm on the right hand side of my corner computer desk using the Allen Wrench supplied. The monitor I mounted is a 27 inch Asus weighing in at 14.3 lbs. The ball joint that allows the monitor to move up and down is tension controlled by use of a small Allen head bolt and nut. When I first set the tension the monitor had a tendency to slide down. A little more tension and the vertical seemed to hold better. After a little use the vertical tension loosened up and had to be re-torqued. The supplied nut used to set the tension had a rounded cap and appeared to cause the amount of torque to be limited because it would not allow the bolt to pass through the nut. A little more torque was required and at that point the round cap on the nut popped off and finally allowed for the required tension to hold the monitor in place. The horizontal adjustment was/is also a little difficult to set at perfectly level as the ball socket would slip past the point of level. That problem was also solved at the point the cap on the nut popped off and allowed the bolt to pass further through the nut. It was either that or go find a nut to replace the original. I chose this arm because a wall mount was out of the question. For what I wanted the arm works great. I can now slide my keyboard, and other things under the monitor and open up more room on my desk. Bottom line, I would recommend this item keeping in mind not to put a heavy monitor on it, and knowing you will have to apply more tension then would seem obvious.</span>

<span>I bought this to hold a Samsung Odyssey CRG9 which is under the 30 pound weight limit, but it doesn't seem to be able to support it.  I've cranked the ball joint tension so high the bolt has actually punched all the way through the cap nut and it still won't remain balanced.  I'm going to give it one more shot tomorrow, but fear that even if I get it to work for an hour or a day, any adjustment in the future will throw it out of whack.  I think it would be fine with a smaller, lighter monitor, but I bought it for its 30 pound weight limit, and it doesn't seem to be a doing a good job for a 26 pound monitor.  I suspect I'll be returning it.  Not recommended for Odyssey owners.</span>

<span>I have two 27" monitors that weigh well over 20 pounds and two monitor arms that have been supporting them for several weeks.  They're easy to assemble, but the order in which they are assembled is important - pay attention.  The cable holder is a nice touch, as is the holster for the included allen wrench for when you need to adjust tension or the arms.  They are easy to move laterally and fit my desk.  While my desk is pretty thin (around an inch lip), these will fit just about any desk up to ~4.5".  Also, I'd recommend having at least 2" to give the clamp something to hold on to.<br/><br/>The only downside to these monitors (and for me, it's not a problem) is that once they're on your desk, it's hard to adjust the height, mostly because it forces you to monkey with the thumbscrew that holds the arm in place, then you either have to get behind the arm or do an incredibly awkward over-the-desk move to lift the monitor and shimmy it up the arm stay.</span>

<span>I bought this because I couldn't find another monitor stand with enough clearance to accommodate a 40" 4k monitor (TV, really). Keep in mind that the monitor I have is only 25 pounds, despite its bulk. You should check that yours falls within the weight limit if you try to hand something that big on this mount.<br/><br/>The design of this arm is a bit different than most of the other top-rated ones in that you can change the horizontal position of the monitor and the vertical alignment, but changing the height is really a two-person project. The benefit is that the mount is quite stable. My monitor does have a little play, but that is to be expected.<br/><br/>One other nice benefit of this mount is that the actual mounting system is pretty intelligent. Rather than having to attach the monitor to the full arm and have someone help you clip it on to the desk, you can attach the arm to the desk, attach the mounting bracket to the monitor, and then just slide it into place. I did it easily without help, despite the heft or the monitor. (Note that if you're using a TV as a monitor, you'll need a VESA adapter plate.)<br/><br/>The biggest con is that the angle adjustment is a bit more finicky and I find it a bit annoying to angle the monitor on the vertical plane.</span>

<span>Summary:<br/>If you are looking for a seamless clean look for 3 monitors, do not buy this. You will be wasting your time and money.<br/><br/>I have three 24" HP V242H monitors that I wanted lined up horizontally with a seamless look. Having worked with triple monitor setups over the last 15 years, one of the most important things is to get the proper viewing angle. When you are sitting 2-3 feet away, you do not want to swivel your head too far left or right to strain your neck. If you sit too far away, you will strain your eyes from reading. So it needs to be a perfect setup or you are just going to tire yourself out and be non productive.<br/><br/>First thing I noticed is that the base is absurdly humongous. On a regular desk, it takes up half the width! Not everyone wants to drill a hole in a desk to mount. By using this stand with its base, you effectively removed half of your desk space.<br/><br/>Second thing is that this stand breaks up at around 12-15 degrees at the curvature point. What happens is that the outer monitors push heavily on the outside edges of the middle monitor. At some point, it "breaks" and all three monitors cannot be angled anymore. This 12-15 degree angle offers very poor viewing perspective.<br/><br/>The only way I have been able to get these monitors inwards more to 20 degrees, is to continue to push the two outer monitors inwards and have their inside edges overlap the middle monitor. The disadvantage is that they don't line up well by "snapping" together to give that seamless look.<br/><br/>Another problem with this stand is that the manufacturer puts the caps on the areas when shipped, where they can be adjusted. Those caps are really hard to get off and look like part of the arm. I spent way too much time with monitors that kept falling forward and not being able to adjust them. Until I noticed that I can remove the caps and use the wrench, that problem went away. The manufacturer didn't show these locations in the manual and had the caps on by default - especially near the curvature points.<br/><br/>Another problem is that the center pole is too small diameter wise. It is not possible to feed three DVI-D and HDMI connectors through it. Also, the exit hole of those cables is too small. Try that with 3 DVI-D cables and it is impossible,<br/><br/>A better design would be deliver a product with arms that allowed up to 2-4" more in length and to let them slide in or out.</span>

<span>This is a very high quality monitor stand that is only lacking in one area that is preventing it from getting the 5th star from me.<br/><br/>First off, the bang for buck here is incredible. I've heard of people spending upwards of $150 - $200 to get a stand to do what this does and I got this stand at the $90 price point with free shipping. And the stand is extremely flexible; all the bending and tilting it does will allow you to get the perfect set up you'd like. (I'd recommend sticking with 23.6" or smaller monitors so you can have some more wiggle room to make adjustments. Yes it can support 24" monitors, I tested it, but I prefer 23.6" and smaller for that extra bit of adjustability and wiggle room.)<br/><br/>Second off, if you're like me and like to specifically view the 1 star reviews of products to see what complaints people have, you're going to come across some misguided folk who are going to lie to you. You will read from some of the 1 star reviews that you can not adjust the tension for the vertical tilt of the monitors. That is false. You CAN adjust the tension required to adjust the vertical tilt on the monitors. There are black end caps on the vesa mounts that you have to pop off to see a bolt that you can tighten via the wrench that is included.<br/><br/>And that brings me to my next point - props to Mount-It! for including all of the necessary tools / screws for installation, along with very easy to read instructions.<br/><br/>Now you're probably wondering what stopped me from giving this stand 5 stars. The center pole does not have a large enough opening at the top to fit power cables, larger HDMI cables (rocketfish cables for example) or DVI cables through it, so it was disappointing to discover that I could only run small HDMI cables through it. I can imagine what it would look like if I was able to run all my cables through the stand and have them all disappear from sight. It would look glorious. Unfortunately, Mount-It! must not have considered how thick some connections can be, which led to a slight degree of disappointment.<br/><br/>EDIT:<br/>A few moments ago I discovered you can pop off a cap at the top of the center pole that is limiting the diameter of the pole, thus, increasing the number of cables and variety of connections that you can fit through the hole. It feels pretty cramped with just three cables in there though, and considering you need to be able to fit 6 to hide all cables.... This aspect is still slightly limited and disappointing. Staying at four stars until I can get all 6 cables to be hidden.<br/><br/>Overall, I'd highly recommend this stand to a friend. And to strangers, too, of course.</span>

<span>Very easy to assemble and holds up well once tension adjusted to match monitors.  My one gripe is that the nuts to adjust are hidden underneath caps with no obvious way to remove and not mentioned in the instructions.  It is easy enough to pry up the caps with a straight screwdriver.</span>

<span>Very solid triple monitor stand.  Although the description says max 24 inch, I was actually able to mount 27 inch (diagonal)thin frame asus monitors on this (note their width straight across is 24in).  I only had two of those, but it would support a third.<br/><br/>I’m using the third slot with a 21.5in monitor in portrait.<br/><br/>Note sure if they’ve updated the version since some of the original reviews, but the center monitor is adjustable up and down.  Looks to be by a couple of inches.  I was able to get the monitors to adjust and line up perfectly.<br/><br/>This is a very sturdy monitor stand.  The base is nice and heavy and the design with the two “legs” pointed forward helps support it from Tipping (this is how I’m using- not bolted to the desk)<br/><br/>All of the adjustments tighten up adequate to stabilize the monitors in every direction possible.<br/><br/>If you need to raise the lower your monitor often, this is probably not the stand for you.  Although it does have a vertical adjustment (probably about 18 inches) it uses two screws to lock in place.  So moving would be a pain.  I don’t have a need to move it once set, so works great for me.<br/><br/>Overall I would recommend this stand for anyone looking for a triple monitor stand.  Great value for the $$$.</span>

<span>Awesome and sturdy stand - Even more awesome company behind it. No really, it's true!<br/>This originally wasn't for using as a monitor or TV stand, but for a different project. Since I still have my old and bulky PS3, I have actually bought that stand which does the job nicely, having the old PS3 under it and my new PS4 on the top of it (see photos).<br/><br/>Since some part under the PS4 tend to get really hot after gaming for a while, this stand was the perfect choice, since it has a metallic and vented surface instead of plain plastic like many other stands I saw on Amazon, so the console's heat can dissipate better, and stay cooler longer too.<br/><br/>Stand came in a nice box, including some 3M foam pads for the feet and some kind of small user manual. Stand looks awesome and is easy to set up. Also, along with the advertised 3 holes settings for each legs to raise the stand to the desired level, it have some convenient fine-tuning adjustment of each legs, which is actually all I needed to set mine and level it correctly, since the table I used it on wasn't super flat everywhere.<br/><br/>Since I saw lot of question about how much load this stand can handle, and according to what's written on the packaging, this stand is reported to be pretty sturdy and could support up to 35lbs (or 16 Kg).<br/><br/>The stand I ordered was new but still arrived with a small dent. But no worries though, the awesome company that made those offered me to exchange it for another new stand in no time. I always love a company that stands behind their products. BIG thumb up for that!!</span>

<span>The stand is pretty solid. Legs were slightly wobbly, but fortunately they can be adjusted to reduce the amount of wobble. Height can be adjusted to 3 different levels which is very nice. My TKL keyboard fits underneath quite well and there is adequate room for my hands to be able to use it while still stored there - even on the lowest height level. The top area of it is big enough for most laptops. My laptop cooler sat quite comfortably on it.<br/><br/>Adjusting the height is very difficult on one of the legs because the mechanism to adjust the height is very stiff. Don't know if this could be loosened with time.<br/><br/>I'm very disappointed with the packaging. The product box has no protection at all and was very worn out and damaged when I received it. The stand's legs literally punctured the box and were sticking out. There was also a small dent on my unit.<br/><br/>Overall, it's a pretty good stand but packaging needs more protection.</span>

If you have 3 monitors you really need a motor, so this is a great option.  One negative, the instructions said the left and right monitor arms were marked, but I couldn't find them.

<span>Just got mine and assembled it this morning. Seems very solidly built and I'm pleased with the quality. The instructions were only OK and the parts  and diagrams were too small for my liking.<br/><br/>As others have mentioned, there is a longer "central" arm that your center monitor mounts to, and at either end, attaches to smaller "swing" arms which are where your left and right monitors go. There is an intentional design aspect where these arms can be angled so the left and right arms are moved to be angled towards you, which means the left and right monitors will also be angled that way.<br/><br/>These arms do NOT angle enough though, and the three monitor setup I have is now too flat, instead of the left\right being angled more towards my head. A side effect of this is that it makes this a not awesome setup for a corner cube desk as you cannot get the whole unit very far back into the corner, which was not a problem at all when I had my three monitors on individual stands.</span>

<span> The product seems quality and very sturdy, but the left and right arms are artificially limited to approximately 23 degrees of movement. There are tabs to stop them, which is unfortunate, as it would go farther without them. The "Full Motion" label is inaccurate. See video<br/><br/>For my purpose, I need it to be approximately 45-50 degrees, so it won't do. If you need to angle the side monitors approximately 20 degrees or less, I would say get this. It is very sturdy and has no sag or flex. Assembly is reasonable. Yeah, there are a lot of parts, but directions were easy to follow and all steps were easy to do.</span>

<span>Using this with three 27" monitors puts it at the upper limit of its capacity, and it really seems to hold up well. Since it's free-standing and in my case at the limits of its capacity, it will of course rock a bit if bumped, but you'd expect that of anything with those long arms and not bolted to the desk. Since a person doesn't normally handle their monitors much, it isn't really an issue. I had no problem using the buttons on my monitors to set their colors and get them adjusted. As for the actual mounting, it took some finicking and finessing to get all the monitors lined up just right, not to mention some spacers on the outer monitors, but luckily enough the VESA mounts and the mounting hardware that's included allows you to do so. My only complaint about the hardware itself is the stiffness of the VESA mounts in trying to tilt the monitors. It looks like there may actually be a screw which could be loosened to alleviate some of that stiffness, but the instructions don't indicate that's what it is for and I decided to grunt and curse a bit rather than loosen anything, especially since that very stiffness guarantees that once I do get them grunted and cursed into place they're going to stay there. In the end, everything is lined up beautifully and I really couldn't ask for a better stand at this price point. Also note that, though I do have slim bezel 27" monitors, I ended up with the outer mounts slid in more than 2" from their furthest outer point, so there is plenty of room to install even the widest-bezeled 27" monitor if that's a concern.<br/><br/>This was also a closer fit in the physical space that I have than I would have liked simply because of the design, which has two important points you need to note, though I wouldn't call them actual flaws and didn't deduct any stars for them. First, note that between the support bar going to the stand and the VESA mount for the center monitor, that whole assembly puts the monitors at least 8" out from whatever's behind them. Not an issue for a lot of folks, but I would have liked it if the center VESA mount had been made permanently centered and incorporated into the stand's vertical bar, which would have at least halved that depth. Others may actually prefer trading off that extra depth requirement in return for the sliding center mount for some reason, though I can't really figure out why your center monitor wouldn't be...well...centered.<br/><br/>Second, and possibly the most important: Note that the arms don't swing forward very far at all. I had three monitors set up differently before, and did have them at a bit more of an angle to wrap around more. That main picture is about the furthest extent of how far you can swing the arms as it comes out of the box. With 27" monitors, that makes for a VERY wide setup. The decrease in angle from what I was doing before added quite a few inches to the horizontal space needed for the monitors overall. I understand the limitation, though, if nothing else because increasing the angle any further would likely overcome the base's ability to stay on the desk and the monitors would just tip forward. I will tell you that (providing you can clamp the rear of the stand to your desk or are using smaller and lighter monitors), the stop that limits the swing of the two arms is actually a very small nib that could be cut off easily and allow the arms to swing a bit more forward if you so desire. I started to do so myself, but in the end managed to just squeeze the monitors into the space I had and thus didn't actually modify the stand as I've described.</span>

<span>This is a good quality mount, well built, with some good features. The arms are sturdy and hold your three monitors well.  The outside arms are angled upward slightly to even further reduce the possibility of sagging over time.  However, that puts your middle and outside monitors at different levels sometimes, depending on what monitors your using and where the VESA mounts are on them.  We typically have a large middle monitor and two smaller outside monitors, and I've have occasions where that angle on the arms meant that the two outside monitors could not line up with the top or the bottom of the middle monitor and it looked odd.  The outside arms have tabs on the hinges that limit the swig distance, so the amount of adjustment you can have by rotating the arm isn't as much as it could be.  Also, the design of the spin/tilt/swing adjustment on each monitor is such that tightening that down is impossible once the monitor is mounted to the VESA mount plate.  The base on this stand is very heavy, which makes for a very solid stand that doesn't fall over, but if used in conjunction with a manually lifted sit-stand converter (like we do) it makes it more difficult to lift the desk into the standing position.  would also be very nice if they would add an optional grommet mount to the product, so you could choose to not have all that added weight from the base if you didn't want it.</span>

<span>Have a monster PC case I needed to get up off the floor. This looked great and turned out to be perfect. Don't know if they changed the load rating after some complaints but mine came with this 80 lb sticker. legs look well secured to the top. I did make one small modification to make it perfect. Casters that have the M10-1.5 stem will screw into the socket where the leg studs normally go. I used a jam nut to give them a little more security. Now, I can roll it wherever I need to.</span>

<span>Mono price TV stand: Easy to assemble strong and good quality.<br/><br/>It has short studs that require a hex wrench to tighten into the aluminum pucks glued on to the glass. I did not feel like going all the way out the shop to get my allen or hex wrench set so I just grabbed the stud with pliers and tightened it that way. The studs do not need to be super tight so the pliers did not bite into the threads and mess them up.<br/><br/>I did use some lock tight threat locker on the studs where they went into the aluminum glued on pucks.<br/><br/>Next you screw on the aluminum tube feet. I added 1" felt pads on the bottom of the adjusters that contact the desk top. This should have been done by monoprice as these aluminum feet will scratch your desk top if no felt pads are added.<br/><br/>I kinda feel like whacking a star for no felt pads and no Allen or hex key these two items should have been included for the over all price. But this is a small complaint as the monoprice monitor stand is a quality unit. You should ad the felt pads if you buy one as this protects your desk from getting scratched and as a bonus it slides easy after adding the felt pads.<br/><br/>I bought this to put behind my TV so I could have an elevated stand for a large size Tripp lite UPS. See photo. Had a smaller cyber power UPS and it failed after a yr.<br/><br/>The Tripp lite UPS was much larger but would not fit behind my TV. I did not want to place it down under the TV stand.<br/><br/>Solution? This Monitor stand shelf unit. It spans over the rear TV stand extension and has plenty of room for the UPS and the digital antenna and a few other small things. Problem solved.<br/><br/>I do like the Mono price monitor stand enough I would get one for my desk/monitor if I decided to arrange my office desk in such a way I needed it. I have a Yamaha stereo head unit I use as a monitor stand so I can have stereo sound in my office. It is a bit large but works.<br/><br/>Bottom line yes I do like this monoprice monitor stand and would recommend it to a friend.<br/><br/>~</span>

<span>I bought mine from Amazon warehouse and if it was cheaper it is because it was really used, but nothing a strong glue could not fixed.  The product is easy to assemble and 2 minutes and it is done. I would say it is sturdy as papier mache can be in a way because it is reinforced recycled paper and not wood or artificial wood. I bought two to put my receiver on top and my blue ray under. It will look less messy on the console I have under my tv. The second one was delivered 2 days after despite I haf placed just one order...color is black to match the b&amp;w living. I discretely added black paint here and there on the one I got. ..where the wooden imitation paper had been torn.  Result is more than ok and cheaper than buying a certainly more expensive tv furniture I did not want anyway because I love my black console.  Dimensions are 19.5 inches long and 3.5 high. There is a space behind to let cables pass. It is deep enough to slide the blue ray under. Nothing fancy here, it is just a surrelevated rectangle at the end. I do not think it would support 5 kg (10 pounds) for example, that is why I doubled it to divide the weight of my appliance on 2 of them, but a PC screen should be a problem. Now it might not be enough elevated because 3.5 inches high is not a lot, but it depends on the height of your office desk. You can see the sides of the 2 juxtaposed stand risers and the 2nd one is a frontal view of one of them.</span>

<span>I have been using this desk converter for a couple of months now and it does exactly what it should; it gets me off my butt and on my feet. I find that I'm on my feet for at least half of every day now instead of maybe 20%. The work space is just right.  Any bigger and it would tie up too much of the counter space and any smaller would make it unusable. It raises and lowers easily and smoothly with little effort. The most difficult part of the set up was adding a pole for two monitors to be mounted. But, even that wasn't a major obstacle. The desk is sturdy, doesn't shake, is a hard surface that cleans easily and, after two months of daily wipe-downs it hasn't shown any signs of fading or wear.  It is a good desktop for the price paid..</span>

<span> 3/19/2020 - update to the original review, so since I first set this up, the right hand release mechanism has pulled free and lost its tension on the lock release cable. It will still hold in place as it is but if the other side also fails then it will be useless.  One of these days if I have the time I might clear the desktop and flip it upside down and see what has failed in the mechanism.  Others have asked about using a laptop and a docking station but that will not work due to clearance issues, see newly added photos. There is a support bar that gets in the way and there is not much room behind the keyboard holder. Still, overall I am happy with this purchase. Easy to setup and I was able to fit all three of my displays. Raising and lowering works pretty well, no problems.  Well worth the purchase price.</span>

<span>I purchased the 46" corner converter and added the dual monitor mount<br/>Pros: sturdy, easy to lift/lower, plenty of room on the top and for a keyboard, and it raises high enough for me to be comfortable (I'm 5'10")<br/>Cons: Limited space for a mouse when using a wrist rest and the mouse pad is a bit too large (but this is still larger than most). Also the instructions for the dual monitor mount were confusing. I thought I could just attach the base with the clamp, but the clamp is too large to allow for the desk converter to be completely lowered. A bit disappointing since I purchased as a set and thought they'd be compatible. Instead I followed the alternate instructions and had to put the pole through the hole in the back of the desk converter, so it worked out fine in the end.</span>
