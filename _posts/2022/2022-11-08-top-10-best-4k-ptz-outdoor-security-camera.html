<span>Purchased immediately when I found out there was a vertical mount paired with the camera.  Originally wanted to connect with my NVR but you lose many features with earlier model NVRs. So I installed an outdoor power outlet and connected directly to my router via lan cable instead. The camera works seemlessly with the Reolink app along with my NVR. I  disassembled the camera to install the vertical mount which may have caused me to reinstall incorrectly or my first camera was actually bad.  Either way, I had to exchange it which was so easy with Amazon.  My second camera worked as soon as I plugged it in.  Reolink support was standing by in case I needed help but the exchange happened so quickly that I really didnt need them, although they did send an updated NVR firmware just in case.  A lot of work for my first PTZ but well worth it.  May get another one for a secondary property. I'm still fine tuning settings but works great so far.</span>

Monitoring a large area comes with its share of obstacles. Usually, they require several security cameras to ensure proper coverage. A PTZ security camera such as this, however, can overcome many of these issues. With its ability to pan left and right, tilt up and down, and zoom in incredibly close thanks to a 12× optical zoom lens, this PTZ camera can do it all. This camera also features vivid 2K resolution recording, along with a fully weatherproof exterior for year-round protection. PTZ is an acronym for pan, tilt, and zoom. This means that a PTZ security camera has the ability to move its lens in virtually any direction, as well as being able to zoom in on objects in the distance. This PTZ camera features full 360° panning rotation, a -15° ~ 90° tilt ability, a 12× optical zoom, and a 16× digital zoom to focus in on even the finest details.

<span> Camera works very well. It’s heavy and large so plan install well.  The zoom is very good, however, camera performance is limited by the Lorex app (iOS). There is no capability to zoom through the app.  How often are you actually sitting in front of the NVR???</span>

<span>Hello guys. So I’m an Amcrest user for the last couple of years, and I’m pretty happy with my purchase. My old camera is 4M - 2K Video resolution bullet security camera, which still works perfectly fine. I bought this new one to have a better view of the other side of my apartment. Here is what you are going to find in the box:<br/>- User manuals, drilling template, weatherproof connectors for your Ethernet cable, screws and sheetrock anchors and also security type bit which you will need to separate the mounting base from the camera unit. DO NOT be surprised if you won't find power adapter in the box. This is PoE camera - Power Over Ethernet. You will need PoE switch and Ethernet cable, or you can still use power adapter, both you have to buy separately.<br/>The build quality is very good, it has metal body, it is IP67 waterproof so you don’t have to worry about the weather condition such as rain, snow, etc. On the front of the unit is 2.8mm 4K camera sensor and a single night vision sensor instead of multiple sensors which is capable of recording a night footage up to 164ft. You can also manually tilt and pan with good enough range of adjustability to point it to whatever direction you want.<br/>I love the fact that this unit has MicroSD card slot for up to 128gb. On my old one the SD slot is located on the bottom side of it, but on this one the slot is located inside the camera shell. You have to dissemble the whole unit to install the SD card. But I like this way better. Your card will be way more secure and way more difficult someone just to walk by and steal your card. Don’t be afraid to install your memory card. If I can do it – anyone can do it. It will take you less than 5min and all you’ll need is a regular screw driver and the provided security type bit in the box. I’ll post some pictures bellow how to do it. You can also use your PC storage, Amcrest cloud or NVR storage.<br/>Now about the camera it self. You can use the provided Amcrest PC software or just download the Amcrest app for you Android or Apple device. From the app you can basically control everything such as your video quality, zoom in and out, take snap shots, set motion and audio detection or schedule recording, flip or mirror the image and also download recorded files to you device. There is also an option to manually turn on and off the night vision sensor or just leave it on auto. You can check for updates form the app itself which is great. The camera has a built-in microphone which works very good. You can easily hear the people walking by. I love the 112* wide view angle and the 4K video. The daylight quality is very good, crisp and clear. You can see license plate number up to 40-50ft. The night vision also provides smooth and clear view. Your are capable of recording up to 3840x2160 – 15fps. I’ll post some pictures bellow to see the difference between this camera and my 2K old one. As you can see on the pictures below the 4K sensor on the new camera provides better and more clear images and video from the 2k sensor on the old one. The same on the night images the 4K video is more detailed and more clear than the 2K. Don’t get me wrong both cameras provide very good audio and video quality but I think the T2499EW 4K e better choice for me.<br/>So here are some pros and cons:<br/>- Pros: - I like the how customizable is the app and the fact that you can control everything;<br/>- One of the best features is continuously recording on SD card and easy download the files to your device/PC.<br/>- Build quality is very good and sturdy;<br/>- Good enough motion of adjustability/pan and tilt/;<br/>- 2.8mm sensor – provide 112* wide viewing angle.<br/>- 4K /3840x2160/ good video quality.<br/>- Very good quality on the built-in mic.<br/><br/>Cons:<br/>- It will be nice if the power adapter is included in the box. Yes, I know this is PoE camera, but this will make it one time purchase, ones you get it you won’t need to buy the additional adapter or switch.<br/>Higher frame rate — 30fps 30fps instead of 15fps on 4K video will be also nice.<br/>- The user manual need to be a little more detailed such as how to install your SD card and where to find your QR code for quick mobile setup which is located on the camera power cable not on the box or camera itself.<br/>- The Amcrest View Pro app does not work on my iPad and needs to be updated. I downloaded the Amcrest View Lite instead.<br/><br/>Over all I definitely recommend this camera. For the price provides very good day and night time footage. Very good wide angle. The 4K video I definitely a better choice than the other 1080p or even 2K cameras. Nice and crisp audio. App full of customizable options. SD card recording is a huge plus over the other security cameras on the market. Easy to install and to setup.</span>

The housing allows the camera to pivot 360 degrees around or 78 degrees up/down (all manual).<br/><br/>It has an ethernet port that is 10/100.<br/><br/>The security camera has a microSD card slot that supports cards up to 128gb. The unit can be managed by any NVR software that supports ONVIR or through an Amcrest dedicated NVR, or through Amcrest Cloud. I would recommend using a dedicated NVR or NVR software on a dedicated computer. The MicroSD card should be used as a fail safe instead of a primary means of storing and playing back camera footage.<br/><br/>This camera gives you the option of H.265 or H.264 compression. For the low price of $109.99 it’s nice to see that it comes with H.265. The Unifi G4 Pro (4k sensor) at $450 does not offer H.265.<br/><br/>The camera also has a build in mic to record sounds with video. There is no speaker with this unit, but that is consistent among networked security cameras. They are intended to record and not serve as means of two way communication like many wifi cameras sold by Ring, Nest, Arlo, etc. They do one job, record video, and do it well.<br/><br/>Build quality: This is a solidly built security camera using all metal housing. The camera housing is able to generously pivot providing me flexibility in mounting options. With Unifi cameras, the camera itself has an ethernet port to plug in your own cable. With this camera, there is a cable permanently attached for 12-18 inches, and at the end is the port. The box comes with a connection cover to help with waterproofing. Normally, I would be concerned that this hardwired ethernet cable would be a point of failure on something that sees more use and abuse, but given that this is a security camera which will be installed once and not moved, I feel reasonably comfortable saying that this approach to the ethernet connection will not create a device longevity issue.<br/><br/>Other than that, I saw no issues from this early review. I will update this review in 3-6 months with any new observations. The Amcrest 4k camera was tested inside for 1 week, and was installed under an eave so I cannot comment on its waterproofing.<br/><br/>Image Quality:<br/><br/>I have used the Unifi G3 Bullet camera and the G3 flex. Both of these Unifi cameras offer good daytime quality at 30fps. This Amcrest camera with 4K resolution blows away the Unifi cameras during daylight hours, even though it is only at 15fps. In smoothness, I can’t tell a difference between 15fps vs 30fps or it is so small that it does not bother me. If your goal is automatic license plate recognition, I would do a bit more research to see whether you need a beefier 4K security camera with 30fps (more opportunities per second to read a license plate clearly). However, for my use, to look at our property and the street in front of it, this camera works perfectly.<br/><br/>I read online that for security cameras, the most you should put them at is 20fps, and anything more than that is wasting hard drive storage space. I was skeptical of the claim and never bothered to test it because I have enough space on my storage drive. Using the Amcrest 4k turret security camera, I can confirm the 15fps limit at 4k resolution is not a hindrance to my uses and I imagine it will not be for you if you have a typical use case: monitoring your home or business.<br/><br/>This Amcrest 4K POE camera was partnered with the Sighthound Video software which immediately recognized the camera and took only a few minutes to set up. I would recommend finding the camera’s IP address, logging in, and then changing the default password. The default username and password are admin and admin, respectively.<br/><br/>Looking at daytime video quality, I am absolutely blown away by the 4k image quality for only $109.99. It is significantly better than my 1080p Unifi cameras. The Unifi G3 bullet is $150 and the G3 flex is $79 for cost comparison purposes. Ubiquiti also sells a 4k camera called the G4 Pro for $450. It has a 4k image sensor and records at 24fps.<br/><br/>This camera includes a microphone. The microphone is adequate but I would say the unifi microphones or the one included on the Nest Hello doorbell are more sensitive. That may not be a bad thing — those microphones are so sensitive in the Nest and Unifi cameras that they pick up noises from 500+ feet away.<br/><br/>The only real downside of this camera I see is that the night vision could use improvement. It is in general difficult to find a camera that can mate night vision and a 4k sensor and it holds true here. There is a lot of noise in the image, and night vision on my 1080p Unifi camera looks better. The IR led on this camera is fine for about 30ft. 164ft as claimed by the product manufacturer would be a stretch, but I doubt you would ever use 1 camera to look for objects 164ft away. The same is true for the Unifi cameras - they are good for up to 30ft away. For normal use, this camera’s IR led is more than adequate. Moreso, most 4k security cameras in the consumer/prosumer product area range from $200-500. Given this product’s low price, you could add an IR flood light for $20-70, or normal flood lights to improve the night time illumination of your area. If you add an IR flood light, it will aid in black and white illumination. If you add a normal flood light, it will make it easier for the camera algorithm to switch to color-mode, turn off the IR LEDs, and record a more vivid image at night.<br/><br/>Overall: This is a great security camera priced extremely aggressively. For the price, $109.99, most consumers would expect a 1080p or 4mp camera. Instead, this is a 8mp/4k security camera recording at 15fps, IP67 weatherproof, microSD card slot for backup storage, and a wide temperature operating range of -22 F to 140 F.<br/><br/>I have been looking for a 4k camera to monitor the intersection in front of my home as it sees a lot of traffic with people taking turns fast. There have been a few instances of drivers nearly hitting children, or they have hit our landscaping. The Unifi 4K camera at $450 is too much even though it gets good reviews. Many Hikvision and Dahua 4k cameras hover around $180-$220. This camera, for $109.99, hits 90% of the mark compared to the unifi camera for 25% of the price. It does not offer a motorized lens, and it could benefit from better night time video quality. However, I did not anticipate using the motorized zoom lens. So, for 1/4th the price of the Unifi camera, I can recommend this as a suitable alternative. I used the Sighthound Video app to record video but BlueIris is another popular alternative. The daytime video quality of the camera is superb and works well in a variety of lighting conditions from straight-on sunlight to cloudy days. License plates are easy to read and faces have more detail compared to my 1080p security camera.<br/><br/>I would like to review this Amcrest turret 4k camera against Amcrest’s bullet camera, which is a bit cheaper at $89.99. However, if you are in need of a turret style camera, I would strongly recommend considering this.</span>

<span>To give a little backstory, I’m a security camera hobbyist and I have installed multiple camera systems throughout the years.  From box systems to piecing together systems, I’ve had experience with quite a few cameras in my business, home, and helping others as well.  Full disclosure, this is my first time with a 4k camera as well as PoE.  My parents home is in an area that seems to be trafficked by a lot of unsavory people, and most recently, had two cars broken into in the garage.  I had installed a Night Owl 1080p BNC system as well as a 1080p Wyze Cam as a backup.  While it alerted me to the burglary in progress, the video was too blurry to use to ID the thieves, and they were released.  This has made me interested in something better than what I currently use, which is how I found the Amcrest 4k PoE on Amazon.  I’ve never used a PoE before, but it seems it’s the direction that the industry is going.<br/><br/>I was told I needed a PoE infuser (1 camera), or a PoE switch (multiple cameras) to provide power over the ethernet cable, so I picked up an infuser as well.  When I finally received the camera and opened it, my first impression of it was how well made it was.  Most of the cameras I’ve installed were made of plastic, but this Amcrest camera was entirely metal.  Very solid build quality right off the bat.  Next thing to do was to connect everything up prior to the installation.  Honestly, I didn’t even read the instructions, but it took me about 5 mins to connect up everything and another 10 mins to download the app and get the picture on my phone.  Extremely simple hook up, and I can see why PoE has become the default nowadays.  The QR code setup definitely contributed to the speed of the setup.  Once I confirmed that everything was working, I saw that the camera could take a microSD card for internal storage.  This is probably one of the only drawbacks of the camera as you have to physically open up the camera to install the SD card.  If you’re haven’t done something like this before, it would be easy to pull the wrong wire out, or not put everything back together correctly again as the weatherproof seal needs to be lined up exactly.  Not a major issue, but just something worth noting.<br/>On to the camera itself…the images that it produces are extremely clear.  I mounted the camera pointing at the driveway as I wanted the best camera at the point of entry to be able to see detail.  I’m used to using 1080p cameras, so the level of detail the Amcrest has is definitely much clearer.  Here is a still picture of the level of detail in 4k.  You can see the license plate clearly when you magnify it.<br/><br/>While pictures in full sunlight are usually decent quality on 1080p cameras, my main interest was the details the camera could take at night.  Here are two side by side comparisons of a Wyze Cam vs the Amcrest in the same area.<br/><br/>As you can see, the Amcrest has a wider field of view and a lot more detail at night.  One thing worth noting is that the Wyze Cam picture seems brighter, but only because of the infrared light from the Amcrest.  The infrared light on the Amcrest floods the entire area much better than infrared lights on any camera I’ve ever used.<br/>While the camera does have a motion detection notification feature, it doesn’t differentiate between shadows and real people.  I’m still trying to tweak the settings to minimize or eliminate false alarms, but I hope that there will be some type of person detection features in the future.  Still, the notifications are a useful feature that alerts me to motion when its triggered.<br/><br/>Amcrest Cloud is also a very nice feature that will get you up and going without much setup.  I do prefer the Amcrest View Pro app over the Cloud app as I found that the Cloud app does have a pretty substantial lag.  The View Pro app has almost zero lag on notifications and live view.  I also use the Surveillance Pro program for PC which is great for live view as well.  All the programs used seem to be pretty user friendly although I couldn’t get the email function to work.  There does seem to be a discrepancy between the phone app and the PC program when trying to adjust the motion detection area.<br/><br/>All in all, I am extremely impressed with the build quality and the amount of detail this little camera puts out.  Out of all the cameras I’ve used in my years, this is by far one of the best cameras for the money.  Easy to setup, easy to use, and awesome build quality. If you’re looking for one of the best PoE 4k cameras available now without buying a box set, this would be the one.  I know comparing a 4k camera to a 1080p isn't fair, but 1080p's were the standard for a while, and what I had.  If you were on the fence about upgrading to a higher resolution camera, 4k is definitely the way to go, but keep in mind it's currently about 3-4x as expensive.</span>

<span>Image: 10/10<br/>The image is crystal clear 4k sharp. Amcrest's image quality is exceptional. During the day you can see all the details (face, license plate, etc) with great clarity. The night vision is excellent if you make some adjustments in the software depending on where it is installed. It is not recommended to leave these settings in default to obtain the best possible quality. I have several Amcrest cameras and not all of them have the same night vision settings.<br/><br/>Motion detection: 9/10<br/>After making the corresponding adjustments, I can say that the motion detection of this camera is very good. Amcrest's app notification system keeps me updated on events in real time. During the night the motion detection is another story. I had to make various settings adjustments to avoid or reduce false positives. Where I live there are many bugs and this greatly affects night detection. Need a smart face/ car detection.<br/><br/>Features: 9.5/10<br/>Amcrest has many settings available that facilitate control, image quality, networking, events, etc. As I mentioned these cameras require adjustments to get the best result. Amcrest allows you to have profiles for day and night which makes it easy to have two separate options and thus obtain a quality that would be impossible with the default settings. It is important to fine tune settings like BLC mode, Anti-dither, etc.<br/><br/>Hardware Quality: 10/10<br/>The quality of these cameras is excellent, I already have experience with these cameras and none have given me problems for years. I live in the tropics and the average temperatures do not drop below 90 and now in the summer they were 105. I am confident that by buying these cameras I will not have any problems with the environmental conditions where I live. It is a well built and designed camera that for the price cannot be beaten.<br/><br/>Customer Service: 10/10<br/>Amcrest customer service has always resolved me quickly and given me specific help to be able to fix situations or understand the terms of all the adjustments. I couldn't be happier that I chose Amcrest for my home security.<br/><br/>General: 9.7/10<br/>Camera setup was extremely easy, and the image quality is amazingly crystal clear and sharp. I have recommended it to friends and family and they are all equally satisfied with the quality of these cameras. I used the AMCPFB204W Wall Mount Bracket for a complete and solid installation.  Motion detection at night is where I've had a hard time making adjustments to the software and not getting a lot of false positives which makes it a bit annoying. Smart detection needs improvement for better control and no unwanted notifications. I highly recommend Amcrest.</span>
