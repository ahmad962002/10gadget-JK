<span>The Mevo Start is a great camera for live streaming or for recording.  It is good for those getting started in streaming.  It is reasonably priced and has a lot of great features.  You can live stream to most any service.  The camera can be connected via Wi-Fi or with Ethernet (requires a separate adapter).  Wi-Fi works well if you have good access points and signals.  Streaming quality will depend on your upload speeds.  Recording are saved directly to the camera but you will need get a micro-SD card as it does not come with one, but those are so affordable.  You will need an Android or iOS tablet or phone to work with the camera.  There is an app that controls and configures the camera.<br/>There is a built in microphone that works well.  You can also alternatively connect an external sound source to the Aux 3.5 mm jack.  It is configurable for Mic level input or Line level input (like sound board).  There are level controls for audio within the app.  It fits on most any tripod (standard 1/4 screw).  I found battery life to be 4-5 hours which should be good in most cases.  There is a USB-C connector on the camera that can be used for external power or ethernet adapter.  Indicator LED on the front of the camera tells you the connection status and I believe can also act as a Tally light.<br/>One of the nice features is digital zoom.  You can view what the camera sees from within the app.  The app also lets you zoom the camera view in and out.  You can also move a zoomed box around with the full field of the camera, so it almost like having PTZ.  The video feed is quite good and there are settings for things like low lighting and outdoor.<br/>Camera looks and feels well built.  There is no lens cover so you might want to get a case for it.<br/>The camera can also be configured as an NDI source and it works great with OBS, zoom and all.<br/>Good starter and can still be used in more advanced setups (like OBS).  Keep in mind that the app can only be used with one camera at a time (you can move back and forth between cameras).  A multi-cam app is being developed and is currently in Beta at this time.</span>

<span>Future generations will never know how horrible cords and bulky cameras were. The Mevo Start is the future of compact wireless cameras, today. I can now sync multi-angles easily and discreetly place the devices in the set for high resolution capture. The cropping and exposure capabilities in the software are simple and super impressive. I love these cameras. I could not be happier with my purchase. Many thanks to those at Mevo and Logitiech.</span>

<span>If you have the money to invest in this webcam, I highly suggest making the purchase. Logitech has a great reputation when it comes to the webcam sector. I have several webcams and this is now my favorite. Hopefully, this review helps with any decision you are trying to make.<br/><br/>This is one of the few webcams that supports 4K Ultra HD 2160p/30fps. I just upgraded to a 4k monitor, so maybe most people are not looking for a 4K webcam.  At full HD 1080p/30 or 60 fps, this webcam also supports HD 720p/30, 60, or 90fps, it is still by far the best webcam I have right now. It is impressive! Even with makeup, you will probably notice a few flaws in your skin. It is that amazing!<br/>It does come with a privacy shutter that you can attach if you want a physical block of the camera. Not only that, but it snaps on easily. There is also a black drawstring travel bag to prevent scratches and dust when not in use or if you need to travel with it. It does not come with a tripod, but it does have a tripod thread mount.<br/><br/>There is a detachable mounting clip. I tested it on an older, bulky laptop. It is wide, and it worked great. I purchased a tripod because I will primarily use this for my desktop. I didn't like the idea of it hanging on my monitor, as it doesn't have a plastic outside edge. My monitor screen runs to the very edge. If you have a similar monitor, I would highly suggest purchasing a tripod. Another consideration that might make you want a tripod, this webcam can’t be tilted up or down or turned left or right, so it’s basically stuck in a fixed position. With the tripod I bought, the top half has a ball with the plate of the screw that attaches to the bottom of the webcam. This setup on the tripod allows me to adjust it to where I need it.<br/><br/>This webcam is compatible with video conferencing platforms like Skype for Business, Microsoft Teams, Cisco, Cisco Webex, Cisco Jabber, Microsoft Cortana, Windows Hello, Skype, Google Hangouts, and other VC applications, XSplit, OBS, Twitch, BlueJeans, Zoom, Fuze, GoToMeetings, and Ring Central. I use several of these platforms and compared to my older 920 Logitech webcam, I can see a huge difference in quality. I share videos with colleagues, and they have also noticed a difference. As for the platforms, many have a maximum of 720p or 1080p. You probably won't notice a difference when joining a meeting.<br/><br/>Once you start using the webcam, you will see the autofocus and the auto light correction with high dynamic range (HRD). It tracks movements and quickly makes the right adjustments. There are also three fields of view, so you are not limited to a single default. The three views are 65-degree, 78-degree, and 90-degree. If you are not familiar with what each would offer, the 65-degree view is a close-up view of your face, the 78-degree is more balanced with your face and some of the background, and the 90-degree view shows more of the background with you in the center.<br/><br/>You also have omnidirectional microphones with noise-canceling to reduce background sounds to make the voice clear. It does not take away a cat meowing in the background, but I do notice less noise from my chair if I slightly spin.  I have not had any results where my voice is distorted, echoing, or that hollow sound. I think it helps to have two microphones built into this webcam. I want to mention, that the USB cable with this webcam is of high quality. It also is slightly over 7 feet in length.<br/><br/>Pros:<br/>Great sound quality, crystal-clear video, autofocus, auto light correction, 3 adjustable fields of view, high dynamic range (HDR), the image quality of the camera is impressive, and offers a good range of resolutions with still image and video capture.<br/><br/>Cons:<br/>The quality of the construction of accessories isn’t consistent with the camera. It feels like I got cheap accessories. Some might consider the price as a con, but I particularly do not. I feel the price matches the quality of this webcam and the features it does have.<br/><br/>Tech:<br/>Supported resolution: 4K/30fps; 1080p/30 or 60 fps; 720p/30, 60, or 90 fps<br/>Diagonal field of view: 65 degrees, 78 degrees, 90 degrees<br/>Focus type: Autofocus<br/>Lens type: Glass<br/>Built-in mic: Stereo-dual Omnidirectional, with 2 microphones<br/>Dimensions: 1.06 inches high x 4.02 inches wide x 1.06 inches deep<br/>Weight: 2.22 ounces<br/>Cable Length: 7.2 feet</span>

<span>Pros<br/>Good sensor, for what you can get on a computer (pc/laptop) I’ve tried it in light and dark rooms. It’t not better than what your getting with an iPhone or high end android device. But it’s a lot better than several I’ve used including other Logitech and some off brands and few Microsoft ones as well as several laptops.<br/><br/>Mics good too<br/><br/>No external branded weird software to get in the way. They kept this clean just as I like it. It’s just works. That’s what we want we are working no nonsense Logitech gets it.<br/><br/>(internal) Software/drivers and hardware is good: this is what I mean. Logitech generally an expensive company. You could say overpriced, but their stuff has worked well for me when competing products haven’t. The mice for example are fantastic. They have these little touches and never fails that’s not the review but I’m just saying their products are well together on the software end. Autofocus works no messing around with your operating system trying to get the camera to work. It works fine with Team and Zoom.<br/><br/>Cons<br/>Cost: I mean 170 is a lot of money for  good but not high end camera. Think about a high end Iphone or a highend Samsung phone. You almost expect that for a 200 stand alone camera. This is sharp but it can’t touch those kinds of cameras on color or light handling. Does it matter for office calls. Ehh, but still your spending this you must care right? I did. I got tired of looking like a faded blurry mess which is why i upgraded to this. Your just not making memory here. They aren't artistic beautiful web cam pictures but you look pretty decent.<br/><br/>The biggest con for me is the stand. I get it everyone will complain about a stand I’m telling you take their 910/920 series and give me that stand anyway. It sticks better on the monitor, it pivots way better. This thing has a tripod attachment, but I don’t know many offices workers sticking a tripod on the desk. This is the place where I thought they could do a ton better. I mean I can live with it, but it needlessly sucks. Once you get it right it’s basically set and forget well unless if you are a call with a whiteboard and moving around or something (I do that).<br/><br/>It's a good camera. I ‘d probably do it again, because again the other ones just don’t create clear video or have other problems, I prefer to buy something good rather and keep it for like 10 years. I had a C910 for 10-11 years until it got a bit flakey. I bought a Microsoft one before that the cam studio where the autofocus never worked right and kept getting crappy ones form my it department that had weird issues or were impossible to see fine details. I finally expensed this, they pushed back and I just appealed to them … environmental care … buy suggesting continuing to buy me crap that breaks or doesn’t’ wrok will just fill landfills. Just get me a good camera and be done with it.  They are happy because I went away and shut up about the camera . And I am because I ‘ve got Gorilla tape holding a great camera to my monitor. It’s  win for everyone. I think you’ll be happy. You’ll be mildly annoyed with the stand. Don’t expect iphone. Expect good computer camera for calls.</span>

<span>Omg!  I’ve been looking for a cam that does zoom in for YEARS! This cam has it!!<br/>Most cams are made for 17 year old girls who record vids on their laptop for social media.  Their laptop is 12 inches away from their face.  Most cams DO NOT take into account that you are using the cam in a business setting.  My camera (and monitor) are 24" away from my face, so until this point, having the camera zoom would have been quite helpful.  3 settings fit all biz needs.  Up to 3 persons in shot, 10 persons, 25 persons, which is 90%, 78%, and 65% respectively.  GENIUS settings!!<br/><br/>For this feature:  i give it 5+++ stars!  Well done!<br/><br/>Every time they launch a new iPhone, they always talk about what a great camera they came out with.  Again, there is NO ZOOM feature.  The phone is built for a 6' tall man's arm length (taking a selfie).  If you don't have that arm length, your shot is not ideal.<br/><br/>I upload a pic on Fb frequently.  Again, to replace profile pic, there is no Zoom in, only Zoom out.  If you Zoom out, your face will no longer be in the picture.  Stupid.<br/><br/>---<br/><br/>Skin tones weren’t good, but because of another photo app I use, I figured maybe there is an app that I can make further corrections.  My face was pink and my arms were orange.  This won't happen to you as the built-in color correction will likely work 95% of the time.  It didn't work for me as I am brown-skinned.<br/><br/>I called LogiTech to ask if they had an app.  Yes!  Success. Got that solved, too!  (It's called Contrast and Saturation).<br/><br/>All around great camera, I would give it more stars if I could.  Oh, and my friend told me to tell you, you DON'T have to wear makeup.  Full skin correction happens!</span>

<span>Reason for purchasing. I purchased this product for improving the picture quality of my Zoom conferencing and other things like that.<br/><br/>Did I achieve the result?  It does improve upon what I had previously, but I cannot see the 4K quality. Probably Zoom does not allow that (I tried it on a Super HD display!). Let's say that quality is fine, but not as good as I expected though.<br/><br/>Viewing angles: 3 different viewing angles (68 degrees, 75 and 90 i believe) provide a good amount of customization although for teleconferencing using a virtual background, I find the 68 the most suitable. If there were more people participating from the same location 90 is definitely the choice. Good option to have, not extremely relevant for a home office though.<br/><br/>Autofocus does its job and via the G-Hub it is easy to center myself inside the camera.  However, without the G-Hub, I would not know how to do it.  I am sure that there is a way. Autofocus can be replaced by manual settings, but when I tried I did not improve upon the autofocus.<br/><br/>Instruction manual is miserable, but I downloaded one from internet. Not too useful either. At least the schematics on how to install it are very clear and it is actually quite easy as written earlier.<br/><br/>Installation was super easy and it was working within 60 seconds from opening the box. I do have the Logitech G-Hub, as I have also a Yeti Nano microphone and thus the Brio camera appeared immediately on the Hub. To be fair, on a second computer, without G-Hub, I can start Zoom and Zoom gives me the option to select this webcam, but without it, I am not sure where to look for it as no software was installed. As you can see in the picture I attached, the webcam is discrete and it is easy to put and keep in place (I tried it on several laptops and display) I was even able to put it on top of my large speakers while testing with the camera from below my height.<br/><br/>Overall, I am fine with this webcam, everything seems to be in order and definitely it improved my situation, but I was expecting (maybe I had erroneous expectations) a tad higher quality of camera as I see many streamers reaching very nice qualities. Definitely better than mine. The quality is not professional grade, not at the top standards at least.</span>

The micro usb is deep so most cable will not connect and as you put in the cable it goes deeper. After 1 month of use I have to press the thing and hold it to get the file. It's a horrible design.<br/><br/>Also no Micro SD card.

<span>The quality is "good" not great but the price is right. I use it on my motorcycle and turning my head too quickly it is choppy but keeping my head turns smooth it works really well. The picture quality was better than I expected for the price. Sunglasses themselves are pretty comfortable as well.<br/>3 months later: I upgraded my 4 star to 5 star. I had an issue with the glasses "vibrating" but not actually videoing. Seller responded to my inquiry immediately, suggested I format the files. I did that and the glasses work again! I use them for much more than motorcycle rides now due to quality and ease of use.</span>

<span>I have camcorders but I am a crummy videographer. These camera glasses have finally allowed me to capture my grandkids bball games. The kids can check out their own games and relatives that can't make the games can watch them from my postings. I wish there were a zoom in and out feature and a way to mute some of the sound but overall I can't really complain. I have keepsakes the kids will be able to look back on and laugh when they were just getting started. If you want to capture games and you can't remember to move your camcorder or phone back and forth, give these a try, it's worth it.</span>

<span>Overall, I like these glasses. One can always wish it was cheaper, and the build quality leaves a little to be desired with the skin-facing cover panels being loose and ill-fitting.... But the photo and video quality was reasonable, battery life was at least the hour promised.<br/><br/>To change settings, you need to write a very specific text file, then upload it to a particular place in the file structure, but it works. I assume you can leave the time off, but if you don't, it'll set the time when you first turn it on, so you have to do that on schedule.<br/><br/>Biggest complaint: There's no SD card, so your only option to get the movies off is with the provided woven micro USB. I tried several others, and none of them worked. A genuine USB-C would have been way better, but really, just something that worked.<br/><br/>Given that I could lose or damage the cable, I returned the unit, but would buy another if they fix the above issues.<br/><br/> It was comfortable to wear, and I used them even when not recording. Lenses were polarized and on the darker side without being extreme. One I RTFM, it was easy to control. The case was nice. The frames are easier to scratch than the lenses, so be aware of that.<br/><br/>Lastly: No one seemed to notice I had video glasses. I wore them around a fair amount and never got questioned - even though I can see the lens quite plainly (and you can make a good argument it's not hidden), even in extended face to face conversations no one said anything.<br/><br/>I found the camera to point ~10 degrees more skyward than I would like, it's harder to see your own hands.<br/><br/>Almost a really good product, if you can live with the cable, it's worth getting.</span>

<span>I took a shot on trying this model out because the 9 was a lot more expensive. I found the price of the 8 to be a good deal and I have no regrets. The display is crisp and easy to use and the camera quality is excellent. I like the different modes you can shoot in and take stills. The app makes it pretty user friendly too. My only complaint is the battery life. I hear that's a pretty common thing (Wanting longer battery life) but for the quality you get it's pretty worth and can record long enough for most situations. Otherwise spare batteries help. I'd highly recommend this if you are still shooting on the hero 3 or 4.</span>

<span>I paid about $240 on a promotion. GP has had the Hero 10 for a deep discount, on their site. I might have done that. But the price I paid is pretty great for what this camera does, and I don't worry about it much. The good thing is that the stabilization on the Hero 8 is close to fantastic. I ride an ebike up a very rough road and the picture is almost too smooth. It's just remarkable what the electronic stabilization can do. And these are pretty tough cameras. The picture is very nice, if a bit punched up. I guess there is a bland setting. The camera is a lot of fun. It's fun to go outside in the snow and rain. It's fun to point it at odd angle and mount it in weird places. Hey, you want a fantastic camera that does it all, get a Sony A7iii. But that's not reality. The stills from this camera are pretty good, but always wide views. The battery life honestly sucks.</span>

Everything seems great except the voice control. Yes. I do have all voice control settings turned on. The camera will not respond to the voice command "GoPro turn on" which I guess is not a big deal. I can always just turn it on but for what I paid for this camera I would expect "everything" to work. I have recently ordered "The Remote" so using that should be an easy work around for the voice command "GoPro turn on". So far, so good except for the voice control issue. I will update again at a later date if necessary. The voice control issue is the only reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5.</span>

<span>OK - you should know this before you buy it. This is a VERY WIDE-ANGLE LENS. Meaning - if you want your head to be proportionally located in the center of the screen, the camera will need to be mounted within a foot of your face. This is a problem for me since I have no such mount and mine is currently mounted to my large ASUS screen. So, basically, if you're using this for Zoom - you'll look like this picture. I'm sitting comfortably where I would normally sit - any closer and my eyes would hurt. This camera puts me wayyy back and I'm used to having my face be more squarely in the frame.<br/><br/>SO - if you like this wide-angle lens, this webcam is for you. If you enjoy your ENTIRE room behind you in the frame, this is for you. If you like fisheye lenses, this is it.<br/><br/>The lens quality is decent.. but you need proper lighting IN FRONT of you in order to get the best picture. Don't put light behind you - you will always appear too dark.<br/><br/>I'm still debating on this webcam.. I might get used to it.. I'm not sure. :)</span>

<span>This camera sat wonderfully atop my vintage Apple Display thanks to a well-designed mount. It worked perfectly with Teams and Zoom. The privacy door comes with it but you must attach it yourself; it worked flawlessly. This is a real bargain, but I had to return mine, because I was so small in the image that it would not have been professional. (For reference, in order to fill the frame, my face needed to be 9" away.) As the lens is fixed focal length, it becomes the responsibility of software to choose a portion of the image to stream to others in the conversation, yet conferencing software lacks this feature (as of Aug 2022). So I reluctantly returned my eMeet C960 for a more expensive camera with built-in zoom. eMeet has a good product, and I hope others are able to take advantage of its great price and excellent features.</span>

<span>Bought camera in July and set it up to view night time activity on property.  It worked great and I captured many pictures and videos of wildlife that surprised me.  Then it stopped working in October.  The camera went through all of the motions of capturing a photo/video (the LED's on the front responded to motion) but it simply stopped writing anything to the internal SD card.  I checked the card and tried other cards, made sure the 'write enable' tab was in the correct position, it just wouldn't work.  So I sent it to Bushnell for warranty repair (with a $10 check for S&amp;H) October 15.  They cashed the check two weeks later but I never heard from them.  Called them yesterday (which was an adventure) and was told that they don't fix the cameras, just replace them, and the cameras are out of stock and won't arrive until January 4.  So I'm losing 3 months of use from this camera.  I'm not impressed with Bushnell customer service.<br/>Update 5/25/2019 - Bushnell sent me a replacement camera in mid January.  It appeared to be new, in an unopened package.  I set it up and it worked fine, until May 4.  After that it simply stopped writing to the SD card, just like the first camera I had from them.  I've tried all I can think of - new batteries, scoured the setup menus, made sure the SD card wasn't full and the write lock wasn't on.  It simply has stopped writing files.  I'm not going to pursue this with Bushnell any further but just write it off as a bad purchase.</span>

I have been using trail cams for years,this one is cheaper and better,then Wild game,Moultrie,and Stealth,and Bushnell .It's detection sensor is Remarkable to say the least,It actually picks up a cat at over 40 feet at night! I have never seen another camera even come close to this,never!And it was a black cat to boot.For the price ,this is my new Brand.It truly is a step ahead of everyone else,other camera's claim new for 2019,and the picture quality is still 2015.This one is an eye opener,I have not received a penny, or free camera for this review. Be nice though! Winks! I actually had a deer squinting,literally,at this camera,like did I see something,but kept on eating,never seen a deer squinting.It really is a steal,at this price.I am buying more of them,you can't lose on this one folks,hands down,a Fantastic camera,fantastic detection sensor.It really is a great night time camera,and the sound is great too!

<span>This camera is relatively easy to setup. It triggers at the slightest movement, even by grasses moved by wind, so I throw out a lot of images. When I download images, sometimes all the images do not download, so I eject the card,  reload it, import again, sometimes twice, to get them. I suspect this could be a glitch in the camera because I don't have this problem with other memory cards. I use the memory cards interchangeably with my trail cam and my camera, reformatting before reusing. It's a minor problem, but I do have to pay attention. I know the last image on the card is of my arm, opening to turn it off and remove the card.  Night photos are infrared, so not great photos, but you can see clearly what had been past the camera. Daylight photos seem to come out overly sharpened and thus slightly less realistic. Again, this is not fine art photography and you certainly get the information you're looking for. I have not used other brands, so no comparison is possible.</span>

<span>I am not a fan of this camera. First and worst, in 360 mode, the output files are in a proprietary format that requires an app to post process the video into a format that can be edited on a PC. This app will only run on a computer running windows 10 or 11. So in 360 mode it's a lot of work to get a usable video.<br/>UPDATED:<br/><br/>After upgrading my PC to win 10, I find that the GoPro player is unable to export a video. I have spent many hours with customer support but at this time, several reps have admitted to me that many users are unable to export videos and it is a big problem. Customer support can only elevate the issue to the engineering team. They have stated many times that they will get back to me with a solution but never do. Therefore,  I am forced to return this camera in favor of the install. This has been nothing short of maddening dealing with GoPro!<br/><br/>The app for a phone or tablet is very buggy and after you get your video edited, you still cannot convert it to MP4 so it can only be viewed on the tablet.<br/><br/>Customer support is non existent and the manual is not very helpful. Instructions for the app don't exist.<br/><br/>In hero mode, this camera will make a pretty good video but the 360 mode is very hard to get a good video.<br/><br/>This thing eats battery at an alarming rate even when off. If you charge up to 100% and leave it sitting on a table turned off, the next day it will be down to 30%. If you are using it, taking video's, you will be lucky to get 30 minutes before it shuts down due to low battery.<br/><br/>It runs hot, it will get very hot when you are taking video's and sometimes, shut down due to overheating if it gets over 96 degrees F.<br/><br/>Overall, this camera is not very user friendly in 360 mode but will take a decent video as a normal camera. For the price, there are better options out there.</span>

<span>I can't speak for the extreme sports crowd, but I will say this, this camera went above and beyond my expectations. I was looking for a hd camera for recording and taking pictures of my son in BJJ tournaments. I had an issue (notice I say had) where recording the competitions became difficult when you consider that you are not the only proud papa watching their kids. You ended blocking somebodies view or your view was being blocked by somebody, never on purpose but you do tend to get caught up with the proceedings.<br/><br/>So my solution was picking up a monopod and recording from a higher vantage point, the issue from that was you had to bring it down for minor adjustments and you only had an idea of what you were recording. The SP1 negated these issues with it's wide angle lens, capturing a wider view of what it's recording, and almost eliminating the need to center your subject.<br/><br/>I found it to work very well in low light conditions and the clarity was superb outdoors. It has some very cool features, such as slo mo and time lapse. I was under the impression that the unit could tell when it was upside down and it would correct itself but rigging it on to my sun visor in my car with the flat bottom side of the camera facing upward had my recorded video upside down.<br/><br/>With a full charge of the battery I was able to record nonstop for 3 hours and 46 minutes. It does not come with a battery charger, you can only charge the battery while installed in the unit. As previously mentioned by another reviewer, the battery is hard to find, if you choose to use the model number that JK Lmtd uses, it does come up as a Samsung replacement battery when you use the other number on the data plate.<br/><br/>The Apple/Android app for this unit is an EPIC fail! The wireless feature is very slow and requires a reconnection every time you turn off the unit. I am assuming the concept is to be able to use and control the camera from your iPhone or Android phone, but I cannot prove this to be the case because I have yet to make it work properly on my iPhone 5. Viewing from the phone does not work at all, there are controls that show up on your phone to toggle between taking pictures or video as well as a record/shutter button but you are left literally blind without being able to know if pushing these buttons are working when the view from your phone is dead and the viewing screen on the camera only shows the wireless connection, it makes the viewing screen utterly useless in this mode. There is a clear lag between pressing the button and the actual shot being taken with the app, watching or viewing the content you have recorded is also a pain, Kodak must know the wireless feature for the unit is sub par, asking that videos and picture need to be downloaded for viewing because not doing so will result in intermittent video or partial loading of pictures, it becomes a moot point anyways because the app crashes every time you try to download more than 1 file, take that into account when you have recorded 8 videos and over a hundred pics and you decide you want to take a look. Keep in mind that the viewing screen on the unit is useless when using the app and the only way of using it is by disconnecting the wireless connection which is unfortunate because reconnecting it is like groundhog day, treat it like it's the first time you connected it all the time. That is the only reason I took a star off because of this app, if it was sold separately then I would give the app 1 star, even less if we were allowed to. So in a nutshell... Camera good, App bad.</span>

I made a simple two tab conversion kit and now i can use it anywhere.<br/>Battery life? Eh..so so...depends on mode you're in etc.<br/>Underwater is very cool...just be sure to use proper lens included in the kit.<br/>Shock proof to most usual circumstances. I have not dropped it onto a hard surface yet from more than 3 feet.<br/>Sound is good but high wind is pretty loud.<br/>The menu is easy to navigate.<br/>Wifi works well and pairs with the app pixoro sp 1. But it will drain both your phone and camera battery faster than normal camera use only mode.<br/>I also downloaded the user manual from the kodak website and keep it on my phone for reference.</span>

<span>Amazing little action cam. My favorite feature is how easy it is to wirelessly save videos and pictures to my iPhone camera roll. The format is perfectly compatible with no conversion. For larger videos it is faster to use an iOS camera connection kit directly or with a card reader attached… the fastest way. Then you can immediately share directly to social media or edit in iMovie or Clips.<br/>Unlike many other action cams you don’t need to use a computer first.<br/>The color saturation is very good, and images are in focus from edge to edge. It’s wide angle, but in-camera settings can minimize distortion. The camera works impressively well in lower light and night scenes. The grip accessory helps with handheld steadiness, and having the built-in standard 1/4-20 tripod screw receiver opens up your mounting options. The kit comes with a pretty amazing array of mounts anyhow!<br/>You are limited to a 32GB micro card, but with 1080 HD you don’t need the storage of 4K cameras.<br/>On a side note, I purchased a SanDisk 32GB  High Endurance card for this … I figured the card should be able to take the same punishment the camera is able to take.<br/> This video looks fantastic on a TV, and the camera even has a built in HDMI port (cable separate). HD video looks excellent … too much of a big deal is made of 4K, particularly when you consider the trade offs in cost and the time it takes to transfer and edit… this is so refreshingly fast by comparison, and I’m hard pressed to see a difference shared to social media or on phones and tablets. I can barely tell on my 49” 4K TV.<br/>With specs like this, and what I’ve encountered while using it, I can’t imagine why this hasn’t been way more popular. Don’t be dissuaded by peoples comments that this is outdated… you’ll be hard pressed to find another action cam in this price bracket with all these features and benefits.<br/>And I have to mention… no outer waterproof housing is needed.<br/>I regret not having discovered this camera earlier… and I’m thrilled it’s still available here and directly through “Kodak” — yes, I know the name is licensed, but this camera proudly wears that name.</span>

<span> Ordered this for a cruise that we are going on.  Didn't want to spend the money on a Go-Pro and saw this as a good 'budget' camera.  Also liked the fact that it was waterproof without needing a casing.<br/><br/>The first one we received worked the first time I turned it on but stopped working immediately thereafter.  I noticed that the battery got extremely hot while charging and then the unit would not turn on at all.  I am not sure if it was the battery or the camera that was bad.  Regardless, we processed the return and Amazon sent me a new one in just a couple of days.<br/><br/>The new one works great.  Good quality video, though not quite as good as a Go Pro.  Then again, it was also $300+ cheaper so I think the Kodak is probably a slightly better deal.  For $169 you get the camera, a battery, 2 lenses (wide angle and waterproof), charging cable and a bunch of accessories to mount the camera on handlebars, a helmet etc..  The picture is nice and the sound is pretty good too.  I also like that the sound is not muted when in water, as you have no need of a waterproof casing.<br/><br/>The app that connects the unit to your phone works pretty well, though it does lose connection every so often.  I also purchased a head strap mount for the camera and the app makes it easy to control the camera while it is mounted and not easily reachable.  I have uploaded some video that I used as a test with the headmount and app that came out pretty good.<br/><br/>All in all, I am very happy with my purchase.  Solid camera at a good price.</span>

<span>Good for beginners or those who like the vintage-y feel. Should come with two battery packs and a cord in case you want to connect the camera to a TV. My order was initially shipped without the batteries and wires, but customer service made the process super easy! Thanks Tenise!</span>

<span>There seem to be several brand-x companies from China selling this type of low-end camcorder: kicteck, LINNSE, and SEREER. A year from now I'm sure there will be some other alphabet soup of fly-by-night companies selling similar products on amazon. Googling on kicteck doesn't show any web presence, and the camera doesn't say kicteck anywhere on it. So if you have a problem or need a replacement battery or charger somewhere down the road, you're likely going to be out of luck.<br/><br/>Adding to the feeling of sleaze was the fact that packed inside the box was a little cardboard wallet with an amazon logo, with something labeled "amazon gift card" inside -- except it isn't actually an amazon gift card. It's a "chance to" get an amazon gift card if you send them an email at their outlook.com address.<br/><br/>Pros:<br/><br/>- Comes with a charger and two batteries.<br/><br/>- Screw threads for a standard tripod mount.<br/><br/>- It has a digital zoom operated by a paddle on top. I found this helpful when using it for video conferencing when I wanted to stand in front of a whiteboard and narrow the zoom a little.<br/><br/>Cons:<br/><br/>- It's fixed focus. The depth of field seems to go from about 1 meter to infinity. If you're using it as a webcam, you will want to have it at least a meter away from your face.<br/><br/>- The documentation booklet that comes in the box seems to be describing some other version of the camera. The text on the amazon page itself was actually more useful. It has a bunch of cheesy software features like "Beauty Face" that aren't documented, so I have no idea what they do.<br/><br/>- Doesn't come with an SD card, so you'll have to buy one separately.<br/><br/>- There's no jack for an external mic. It has a built-in mic, but it's extremely poor. When I talk in a normal voice from 2 meters away, the audio level is very low, and the signal-to-noise ratio is very poor. If you're using it as a webcam, you can get around this by plugging in a different mic to your computer, but I assume the standard intended application for this device is making videos of your kid's soccer game, in which case you're out of luck, and the sound will just be horrible.<br/><br/>- Rubber piece was peeling off of the control panel.<br/><br/>- Won't power down using the power button when the USB cable is plugged in.<br/><br/>- They prominently advertise the sensor as 24 MP, but this is probably only relevant as a measure of the quality of digital zoom you can hope to get out of it.<br/><br/>The following may be of interest to other linux users. If you start up the camera in MSDC mode (Mass Storage Device Class), you can mount it as a vfat drive and extract photos and videos from the SD card. If you start it in PC CAMERA mode, it will work with the zoom client or a standalone webcam app such as guvcview. (The cheese app doesn't work.)</span>
