<span>Picked up a cheap and cheerful Lenovo Smart Tab M8 and started playing Real Racing 3 and my thumbs quickly got destroyed (too many past injuries and yeah, I'm officially old).  Gas and brake trigger style was WAY mo' better and  eliminated the no-touch-registered problems I was having (thought it was the cheap tablet but I guess I have sweaty thumbs??? ... I'm sounding like quite the odd job now).  Figured I would've busted something in the trigger mechanism by now but these are tougher than they seem initially and stand up to the extra squeeze when you really want to slow down or speed up quickly and can't seem to get through your thick skull that a touch on the screen is a touch on the screen. ;-)  If I eventually break them due to my over enthusiasm, I won't hesitate to buy another pair.</span>

<span>I love that it vibrates, was easy to connect, and it lights up! Felt comfortable and the clip can fit a Note 20 Ultra but without a case. I was hoping it would be able to with a slim case but it couldnt and also the D-pad is constructed in a way where if i press right or left, its very easy to accidentally make it press right down or left down , even up right. I love to play retro fighting games and scollers so unfortunately I can't have it for long term. Perfect for everything else though like modern games that use sticks or FPS shooters.</span>

The instructions instruct you to download an app that isnt available on the google play store for Pixelbooks. I ended up using a plug and play Xbox knockoff.</span>

<span>It does get the job done but is a bit uncomfortable at first, I would recommend if you want to get better kills on PUBG but it’s sometimes unresponsive. You’ll have to turn off your Phone and turn it back on again to get it running correctly(turning off the screen) it doesn’t really fit the iPhone X due to the camera. You’ll have to flip it to the weird side to get it to work.</span>

<span>Used them for a grand total of 5 mins before I took them off and started the return process. After reassigning the fire buttons in PUBG mobile to be aligned with these triggers, they would still not actually fire half the time, and other times fire without being touched. The slightest pressure anywhere near the triggers also caused them to go off unintentionally. What they don't show in the pictures is the 5mm x 5mm copper strip that is the only part of the trigger that needs to be touched to fire, its not a whole trigger that can be used. I'm returning these and looking to order a different brand as I write this. Save your money and your time.</span>

<span>Used with iPhone 11 and it works great! It's a touch cheaper feeling and doesn't hide that's it's plastic.<br/>But, it's light weight (no battery) and very comfortable ergonomically. About as close as these get to the Xbox controller in size/feel. No issues with supported mobile games (ex: Diablo Immortal) or STEAM Link.  However, I had some difficulty with Xbox Cloud Gaming recognizing the controller.  I found there's a known issue with this when troubleshooting and researching.  The Kishi Mobile app may state that the most current firmware is installed on your phone, but it still isn't being recognized.  There's a manual workaround that will push/install firmware updates.  While in the Kishi app, pressing and holding "Y", "B" and the "Start/Menu" button (bottom right button with 3 lines) simultaneously and THEN plugging in your phone will push the firmware update.  There's a video in the Kishi app FAQs demonstrating this.  After doing this, Xbox Cloud Gaming worked great!  Thank goodness, as Game Pass Ultimate was one of the main reasons for getting this device!<br/><br/>link for Android version: https://amzn.to/3BsbMuC</span>

<span>I got this to play Genshin Impact on my phone while at work. I cannot handle using touch screens all the time and this feels so nice as someone who is used to controllers. It also pairs instantly with my phone, and despite the slight drawback of having to remove my phone case to play using the razor, It's only a minor inconvenience. Its simple and easy to use and I honestly switch between using my phone and my iPad for genshin for this: I play with a PS5 controller on my iPad.</span>

<span>I really like this controller, but it's not perfect<br/><br/>PROS:<br/><br/>+ Perfect size. Feels great in the hands without being too heavy or too light<br/>+ My iPhone 13 Pro Max fits nice and snug (without case)<br/>+ Full size Xbox style analogue sticks with R3/L3. Works really well for FPS and TPS games<br/>+ Analogue triggers, great for racing games<br/>+ Wired connection means no issues with input lag or latency.<br/>+ Works perfectly right out of the box<br/><br/>CONS:<br/><br/>- This will not work with phone cases. You may be able to get it to fit, but even with a basic thin case, the lightning port will not connect.<br/>- Home and select buttons are not rebindable and do not work with most apps, which can make things a little awkward when setting up controls for emulators.<br/>- Face buttons and D-pad are kinda mushy and not as clicky as you would probably want. You get used to them, but they still don't stack up to any console controller.<br/><br/>Overall, I really like this controller and think it's definitely worth buying. If the buttons were a little nicer I would give it 5/5. I hear there is a V2 that addresses the complaints with the buttons, but had a massive downgrade in the analogue sticks. Personally I don't think it's worth the trade off.</span>

<span> Wow! Wow! Wow! wow!...Wow<br/><br/>I have had a few different Bluetooth controllers and though at the time they why pretty decent and worked they did not have the look, feel, style and functionality that I wanted. The Kishi not only gives me the best form factor and comfortability for my big paws but give me damn near the same feel of my favorite controller, The Xbox 1 controller. The shoulders and Triggers are smooth while still be clicky. The thumb sticks are freaking fantastic. I will actually say they feel better than my Xbox one controller. D-pad and face buttons , again, damn near feel better then my actual XB1 controller. It is super compact when in travel mode. When in use, it fits my Moto Z2 play, Moto GO ( main) and Pixel 6a with no issues. I nice tight, snug fit with no wriggle room or looseness. All buttons on phone, volume up and down, power and even my front and rear camera are still accessible. Also, if your phone has a 3.5mm phone jack, unless it 8s located on the side of the mobile, you will need to utilize Bluetooth headphones or earbuds for playing in public or in a loud area.<br/><br/>There are speaker cut out on the right side of controller to keep sound from being blocked or muffled. Probably the best thing I love about this controller is there is no battery, it is powered off the phones battery, and my phone's have excellent battery life, especially my moto G8 which is solely dedicated to gaming only. Android, xcloud ( Xbox cloud gaming) and retro arch gaming ( retro gaming). Now, you are probably wondering how long can I play. Really it depends on the graphic intensiveness of the game I am playing. To keep it short, on my main, the G8 I can usually get around 6-8 hours of game play. My Z2 about the same. And Pixel 6a , I am not sure , as that is my everyday regular life phone.<br/><br/>The only thing that seems to not work or I am not using it properly or something, is the type C charging pass through. I have tried multiple type c charging cable but nothing. So, having to remove the phone from the controller is the only way to charge my phone when needed. So, there is probably more I could say about this controller but I will say, for the price. For the functionality. The comfortability. The look and style. It literally looks like a hand held that Xbox/Microsoft could have made. Should have made. 4 out of 5 because of the charging pass through not working, if things change in that area I will then change my rating. Really, it is more like a 4 and half stars. If you have a fair decent to great android phone, I highly recommend getting this controller and adding it to you kit. Highly, highly recommended.</span>

<span>To be clear, I mainly use this tablet for recreational purposes (X-BOX gaming, Marvel comics reading and MLB watching). Nothing crazy. With that being said, it's definitely a steal of a product. Last tablet I knew that went for around 100 bucks was a bad joke! This one is a quality tablet for the tag though. Good picture quality. Speaker placed on the top and bottom so when in landscape mode, you get that surround sound feeling/effect. Don't get carried away though. They're still just tablet speakers. Lol. My only quarrel is that it has a tendency to lag upon certain actions like switching apps or pulling up the keyboard or typing the first 2 characters. There seems to be a slight delay. I would say about a ½ to ¾ of a second. Battery seems decent. Haven't really been able to dive into it as far as charging time and battery length. But it does hold a charge something serious though. I've been watching live baseball games all day and I only needed the charger twice for the day. All in all, not a perfect tablet but for the price, if you're in need of one, it would behoove you to pick this one up while you still can. ✌🏾<br/><br/>Update:<br/>Battery life is VERY good but charging takes some time.</span>

<span>PROS:<br/>- For this price, this is the best you will get.<br/>- 3 Years of security updates.<br/>- Stock Android.<br/>- Solid aluminum frame.<br/>- Great screen.<br/><br/>CONS:<br/>- No NFC, No fingerprint reader.<br/>- Large bezel.<br/>- My onboarding experience was laggy.<br/><br/>This is my second Nokia purchase. After using the 5.3 phone for over a year I wanted to give this a go. I really love what HMD did with the Nokia brand and this was supposed to replace my Xiaomi Mi Pad 4 Plus (2018).<br/><br/>I got the package today, and started using the "link your device"; which began seamless. Then, wifi started crashing every few minutes while installing the apps.<br/><br/>So, I did what I know best, and did a factory reset; hopefully it was my mistake.<br/><br/>After boot I got no wifi at all, couldn't turn it on. Another boot.<br/><br/>Now everything seemed to work. I reinstalled my apps.<br/><br/>I get kicked out of my wifi every time the CPU heats up (and you can feel it heat up, BTW). This is a minor bug that I hope would be fixed in the next system update. I also can't really use my banking apps (I have to enter the login details every time) because there's no fingerprint scanner. However; this is not Nokia's fault. This is a poor design with my banking app, not implementing Face ID or something like that.<br/><br/>You should get it if you need a tablet.<br/><br/>You shouldn't get it if you need a tablet for gaming, or something which would go with heavy use.</span>

<span>For any of you looking to purchase this tablet due to it being AER certified and having the properties of 3 years monthly updates and 2 years OS updates, you will be disappointed. As of now, most of these tablets will only have the August monthly patch and the June Google Play Update. If HMD Global actually kept its promises, this tablet would be one of the only Android tablets on the market that would actually be as secure as any could come. As of right now, that is just not the case, and it sadly fails to meet its potential.<br/><br/>Other than that, the screen is okay; it does have a bit of a bluish tint to it. The resolution is fine for an Android tablet of its class. Don’t expect an iPad quality screen though- you will be disappointed. Even the entry level iPad’s screen is better.<br/><br/>Another point of contention would be the official support of microSD cards of up to only 512GB. One of the only biggest strengths over iPadOS devices is wasted here as well.<br/><br/>If Nokia was serious about following through on their promises, this would be a fantastically compelling Android alternative to the iPad. Unfortunately, for most people, I can only recommend spending a little extra money buying the entry level iPad. I bought this tablet hoping to finally have a decent, secure, Android device that could hold much of my media without having to shell out around $1K or more on a mid-high range iPad. Ultimately, I’m coming out very disappointed.<br/><br/>*UPDATE March 2022*<br/><br/>It seems that Nokia has become more serious about updating this tablet. As of this writing in early March, the Google Play Security update is at February 2022 and the Security patch is at January 2022. While not too much better than the initial situation, this tablet should be among the most secure choices for Android in the long-run. Additionally, the battery life has proven to be pretty impressive too. Another important note would be that the T20 has yet to receive the Android 12 update despite the two years of promised OS updates. I will add an additional star to my initial review because of this update.</span>

<span>Likes:  This tablet is very fast and very responsive, light weight, it has plenty of GB for apps and a Micro SD expansion slot for up to 512 GB.  It has a long-lasting battery per charge. It has a built-in radio tuner that uses wired earbuds for the antenna.  This could be important if you're in an emergency situation and need to know what's going on around you. It has a USB Type C charger/connection but it lacks fast charging.<br/><br/>Dislikes:  For as many speakers as this has, the sound/speakers should be better.  The cameras are so so.  Some people like stock Android, but being used to Samsung tablets, I like more functionality for more personalization.  The Night Light feature is too beige/green.  It feels awkward to always press the power button at the top of the tablet to awaken the screen.  It's hard to find good cases for this tablet.  Get a case directly from Nokia...they make one with a lid and one without a lid that are very nice.  Otherwise the Fintie brand case for this particular tablet is decent.  I wish an origami-style case existed for this tablet.  I've searched just about everywhere and there's not one to be found.<br/><br/>Overall: It's a very good tablet.  Use Honey to be reminded of price drops.  I got mine for $174.99.<br/><br/>After using this tablet for a few months, I can say that I'm very happy with it.  I later bought a Fire HD10 Tablet to compare it to the Nokia t20 and I like the Nokia t20 much better.  The Nokia t20 is super fast.  In one of the paragraphs above, I mentioned that being used to Samsung Tablets, I like the functionality that allow for more customization.  Well, I'm over that.  This tablet is very customizable.  One just has to learn how to do the desired customizations on this tablet which is different to what I was used to.</span>

<span>Does everything I expect an Android tablet to do, very well. No issues. Great display. Very responsive.<br/><br/>When in meetings and on the road, I prefer this to my Chromebooks.<br/><br/>Note - I use Google Sheet, Docs, Messages, Google TV, Kindle, etc. No gaming.<br/><br/>Not the fastest WiFi connection. May be an issue for gamers.</span>

<span>The device is amazing. Think of it more as a device that has two separate screens rather than a single screen with a line down the middle. Full screen does not look good for me. So I use each window as a separate entity.  I enjoy watching movies on the device. Typing is a learning experience, but it's not the device.  We are used to different aspect ratios when typing so there's a learning curve.  I used to own a blackberry passport and this device is similar in size dimensions. For me, it is my preference for movie watching.  As far as camera, I have a dedicated phone for that. As far as music, I have a dedicated phone for that.  I have not connected this phone to my car, as I have a separate phone for that.  Battery life, I'm OK as I work in an office so charging is not of issue. I do not play video games however, cloud Xbox may look good on this mobile device. I was able to purchase this brand new for just over $300.  I do recommend at that price point. Remember, 2 screens.  Would I use this as a primary device. No.<br/><br/>For reference, I have the following devices<br/>IPhone 12 mini<br/>Samsung Fold 3<br/>Samsung Flip 4<br/>Sony Xperia Pro I<br/>Google Pixel 6A</span>

<span>Phone was in new condition, fully unlocked. Model is USQ00001. It needed a small charge for the first boot. During the setup Duo rebooted several times to install all of the updates (about 2.5gb). After that it works quite smoothly for me.<br/><br/>My Armenian Ucom sim card is working good, and there is an option to use esim which I will try. (Update: esim is working, device is dual sim - single standby)<br/><br/>In general, I am very impressed by the hardware and satisfied with software. I'm sure that future updates to 12L will make it even better. Greatest value for money.</span>

<span>I got the Duo to replace my S7 and happy I did. I love the multitasking experience possible on this device. Everything is an upgrade for me, battery life, screens, and camera. It took me some time and patience to get all the touch gestures down, but once I did, everything flows smoothly. you can make and receive calls on the Duo, but it's not a cell phone. It's something else, something better.</span>

<span>So I have owned the Surface Duo before when it was first released a few years ago. It was hands down the worst decision I had ever made in a mobile device. It was so glitchy, the screen kept rotating, the apps were unusable, etc... Fast forward to 2022 and the updates that the device had has resolved most of the issues that plagued it initially. More recently, the device has upgraded to Android 11 and the newest updates that are also available on Duo 2 (Duo and Duo 2 are rumored to have the Android 12L update in a few months). This device with certain apps out performs my iPhone 13, and it is a productivity powerhouse thanks to the two screens. I have a new found appreciation for this device and for the price point it is well worth it, especially if you want to just give it a try to see what it is all about. Overall, I give it 4 out of 5, since there are still some minor things that it can work out and of course the dreaded camera that is on this thing. I do not take pictures with my phone quite often, so it doesn't bother me too much, but the camera is really the one thing that is just bad. Other than that well worth the price!</span>
