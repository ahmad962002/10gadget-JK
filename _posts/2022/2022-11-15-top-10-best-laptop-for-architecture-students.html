<span>I was curious about Chromebooks &amp; wanted to give one a shot. I looked this one over, and Alice helped me with questions I had. (She was great BTW).<br/><br/>I'm really enjoying this little Chromebook. It's lightweight, has crazy battery life (about 10 hrs). I'm still learning all that Chromebooks can do, but it was definitely worth the purchase. 2 Thumbs WAY UP! :)</span>

<span>This is my first Chromebook, and I've been using it for two days.  The battery life is amazing so far; it does appear to be 10 hours. Reading the reviews, it seems like a wide range of experiences, and I feel fortunate that mine works well so far.<br/><br/>It was very easy to set up. I saw 11.5 in the description, but the actual display screen is 10 inches. It isn't a touch screen, and the keys are dark gray, not black. This was an impulse purchase after getting a new laptop a few days ago. My 6 year old Dell would work no longer, and I got an expensive gaming laptop. It was my second one, but I was not expecting it to get so hot, with a noisy fan. The battery life is about an hour. To feel more comfortable, I wanted a Chromebook for email, YouTube, and Amazon videos. So, this is doing what I want it to.<br/>I will likely get more used to having no delete key, instead the alt+backspace key is used for that function.  I was surprised when my bookmark bar appeared with bookmarks from 2013 on. I've deleted many of them in the bookmark manager.<br/>My main dissatisfaction is the disappearing vertical scroll bar. In some emails, you can select "view in<br/>browser". I would be more frustrated if I didn't have the laptop available. There might be a fix for that; I haven't researched yet.<br/>I purchased mine when it was 52% off, which is worth it.  Buying electronics is risky. I've been very disappointed in the past, which is why I'm relieved and accepting of the machine I got.<br/>Almost everything has become more expensive, and reasonable expectations seem to be in order. With two days use, I'm not regretting my purchase.</span>

<span>This Chromebook is dirt cheap and would be great for a student on a budget or someone who just needs to use a few apps and browse the internet.  I use it as a writing laptop, as I don't want to take my expensive, bulky gaming laptop all over the place.<br/><br/>Despite being plastic, it does seem to be solid.  The matte finish is a fingerprint magnet, though it's not a big deal.  The battery life is good, and as far as Chromebook keyboards go, it's fine to type on and better than some I have encountered in the past.<br/><br/>It's fast enough, though it's not zippy and will struggle with heavy apps or opening too many at once.  The screen is also not exactly beautiful and looks very dated.  Still, do you really need a nice screen on a $100 Chromebook?  You also need to be aware that Chromebooks basically have an update expiration date, so before you think you're getting a sweet deal on one, be sure to look up when it will stop receiving updates.  I believe this one is good until 2026 or 2027, which is enough time to get enough bang for your buck.<br/><br/>If you're aware of this Chromebook's limitations, this may be a nice buy.  It suits my needs, and honestly I can't stomach the idea of paying much for a Chromebook in the first place.  I won't feel sick if it gets lost or stolen while I lug it around, but it does what I need it to do well enough.</span>

<span>This laptop is well made and light weight.  The Blue Tooth is however not useful.  The LG software to download drivers is pretty frustrating.  The drivers can be found to enable all devices within a Microsoft Windows Enterprise 2019 LTSC but they will take some patience and research.  You cannot get them from LG and their download tool does NOT work in anything other that 20H1 or better.  If the drivers were not such a pain I would have given 5 stars even with the blue tooth issue.</span>

<span>Key Points:<br/>- A cheap deal for a competitive performance laptop<br/>- Thin &amp; Lightweight (Easy to carry)<br/>- Large storage space for basically any consumer need<br/>- Comes with HP Customer Service application on set-up (1-year warranty)<br/><br/>Experience:<br/>If you're like me, you hate to buy something without the full confidence in the product first. Believe me, it's difficult sometimes to buy things online due to the limitation of only being able to rely on other customer's reviews before the product is purchased and arrives at your doorstep. However, I have a pretty positive outlook on this laptop for its price. I attached a few photos to showcase its exterior mechanisms, as well as showcase a general size of what laptop to expect in real-world size (as opposed to reading numbers and expecting to visualize that in your head). The laptop is about 23cm length by 35-36cm width with a thickness of 1.5 cm. The weight is as advertised, it's comfortable to carry around and will fit in thin spaces; it won't occupy too much room in a backpack or luggage. For its technical aspects, I used a free CPU test online called UserBenchmark to compare its performance to other users who also documented their computers/laptops. (This provides a bias as it only takes into account for users who test their computers on that specific software, but it's still a good comparison to get a general idea of the performance the laptop provides.) Attached also is the report containing simplified and relevant data to its specifications. Its computing power is where this computer shines the most, as it performs in the top 75%+ percentile, which is what most consumers will desire, as GPU is of less importance in that they don't intend to purchase a cheaper laptop with the intentions to play heavier &amp; more demanding video games on it. I was actually pleasantly surprised to hear of a lower pricing laptop that came with 16GB of RAM, which is almost unheard of for this price range, and although I didn't document how much free space was available upon receiving and setting it up, there is still ~400+ GB available after transferring the bulk of my applications and user data from my old laptop. For the price it's set at, I personally think it's a great deal since its competitors will often price the same specifications for almost twice the price. As a side note, HP doesn't load the computer with so many useless applications as Lenovo does that the consumer will more than likely never use... (occupying memory). Overall, very happy &amp; satisfied with my purchase, I would thoroughly recommend it, and I look forward to programming code with this laptop.</span>

<span>I will try to cover all important information that is necessary before buying this laptop, mainly i will focus on hardware and performance .To start with , I bought this laptop for my study purposes and with 16gb of RAM it works great, However if you are seeking for games as well , i would not recommend this laptop due to low screen quality and Graphic card.<br/>MANUFACTURING - The laptop is made of plastic , quality is good but Could not compete metal body. Moreover , I love the design of screen , almost minimum bezel and it gives a premium look. Keyboard keys are smooth.I sometimes face a little issues with touchpad sometimes it stuck or hangs maybe i can call it less sensitive that isn't a big issue to worry also the touchscreen works really fine , no worries at all. There are no lights under keyboard pads,so it makes it difficult to type in dark.<br/>PERFORMANCE- This laptop starts pretty fast in almost under 20 secs, it will boot up and take you to desktop. I played Asphalt 9 on this laptop on the very first day and it played smoothly  , and you can play other games also but problem will be that it will be in low quality due to less resolution of screen otherwise processor has no problem in running games (for more information you can search for processor details on google according to your priorities).I would not recommend for gaming purposes.<br/>THINGS TO NOTE- Since this product is available from third party you won’t be getting 12 months warranty cause they upgrade the laptop and then deliver further, in my case i got 9 months of warranty.<br/>Laptop is quite slim and gives a quite unique look. No problem with wifi and battery (4-5hrs on screen battery backup). This was all i knew , To sum up product requires smooth handling due to plastic build , system never hanged for me although i tried to overload it .So if you are looking for light usage and minimal gaming its great also touchscreen is a great feature. .I have attached few screenshots of the device full name and general specs</span>

<span>If you are using this laptop just for normal use like streaming videos, Ms Office. Great for consuming contents but not great for making yourself productive. It cannot handle adobe products or any heavy software that requires GPU or even the CPU. If u start using even like 3 tabs the fan noise just irritates your ear and the bottom part gets Super HOT. My best suggestion, get an external Fan along with this laptop if u have one.</span>

<span>We purchased this laptop as a backup for our photo booth business and as I was familiarizing myself with it I realized that this is now going to be our main laptop. It boots up incredibly fast and seems to be faster and more responsive than the i7 we were using. It may be due to the SS drive vs. traditional hard drive, but it makes a big difference! The screen quality is excellent and the I/O has everything that we need to connect the camera, monitor and printer. After a lot of research I am SO glad that I found and purchased this one.</span>

<span>I love this laptop. It replaced an Acer aspire 5 slim, which was quite heavy, and had a battery that lasted five hours. In power saver mode. It was only two years old and rarely used until I started a new job and school. I had my MacBook going from 8:30 AM to 8:30 PM pretty much consistently, and it still had 55% battery life. Because I have an iPhone, I can make calls and send texts with it. My iPad can be used for sidecar, which is basically wireless screen mirroring, allowing me to have a portable second monitor. The mac doesn’t skip a beat- I can leave it closed overnight, and everything is exactly the same the next morning without crashing or reloading. It’s not at all heavy, and the size is exactly what a laptop should be. The Mac OS not supporting steam titles thing isn’t a huge deal- If I want a gaming machine, I have a desktop. For getting things done, this is an absolutely perfect daily driver, and I wouldn’t hesitate to recommend it to anyone. My one gripe is lack of USB-A ports, but I’ll buy an adapter and move on with my life. Overall, try a MacBook Air… You’ll like it. UPDATE: I found a program called Parsec and so long as my Mac has a stable WiFi connection, I can remote into my desktop and use steam along with everything else.</span>

<span>This thing is amazing. I have owned several windows gaming laptops and this is hands down the best laptop I have ever purchased. The build quality is amazing, the chassis, hinge, keyboard, and mousepad all feel very high quality. the laptop is light and easy to carry around. The battery lasts what feels like a lifetime. The computer does not get hot at all (even after some heavy video editing and transcoding). Apple has truly made the best laptop on the market. Now to the negatives: I have read that the OS excessively uses virtual memory to speed up the system. After doing some initial tests I can confirm that this is true. What does this mean? this means that the Internal SSD might not last as long as it should because of the excessive write and read to the Solid state drive. I don't know I this is by design or what but it definitely feels kinda crummy for Apple to do this. I would still recommend this computer to anyone needing a laptop for school, creative work, or just general use. Buy it you won't regret it.</span>

<span>As a relatively inexpensive and light laptop, the Acer Swift 3 is pretty solid. It's not a heavy duty laptop and it isn't going to be a great option for gaming or video editing or anything that requires a lot of processing power, but as a general purpose laptop for surfing the web or watching YouTube videos it's going to be perfectly functional.<br/><br/>It weighs in around 2.6-2.8lbs (my scale isn't very precise and the reading fluctuated between the two after several tries), which makes it quite easy to carry around without feeling weighed down. The construction feels about what I would expect for a computer in this price range, which is to say it's not top quality but it's not flimsy either. The keyboard is not overly clicky, although it is a bit louder than i would like. I am generally not a fan of laptop keyboards as I prefer a bit more responsiveness but all things considered it's not bad. The backlighting on the keyboard works well.<br/><br/>The Cinebench score was a rather pedestrian 5000. But regardless of benchmarks, I have found it works perfectly well for my everyday needs. I can have a full-screen video running on one screen while surfing the web on another with no lag or hiccups. I keep several programs open all the time (including Chrome which is a serious memory hog) and the laptop doesn't have any performance issues. Considering the price point I am very satisfied with its performance.<br/><br/>The one negative about the setup is that the RAM cannot be upgraded (I got 8gb and wanted 16gb but wasn't going to pay the ridiculous cost difference to buy it pre-installed).  I also would have liked 1 more usb port, but 2 is pretty standard so it's not something I would hold against it. Overall I am very satisfied with this laptop. If you don't carry your laptop around very much you might consider looking around for other options because there are probably other more performant options around this price range at the cost of more weight. But if you want a portable, inexpensive laptop that performs well on common everyday tasks then this is a great choice.</span>

<span>I bought this with the intention of running Zorin OS and never booting into Windows. So far this laptop has been great. The screen is very nice, the keyboard is decent, touch pad works well, I have never heard the fans, external GPU does work, and the battery is great; which is the main reason I purchased this laptop.<br/><br/>In case anyone is interested in also installing Zorin, the camera login isn't working for me even after trying some workaround, webcam works but the hello windows alternative does not. I'll report back after some time, I think its just a driver issue. The finger print driver also does not work. There are some claims that some users were able to get this working but I have not been successful. I'm not really all that interested in those options but it would be nice to get the finger print device to work. For graphics, the Xe driver doesn't seem to work that well but I'm guessing that with some time, this will change.<br/><br/>Overall, I'm super impressed and very happy with this purchase. I can't speak for Windows as I never let it boot before wiping out of the box, due to the systems specifications the bloat in Windows likely causes some resource issues. I imagine that this is what causes most of the bad reviews on this system, outside of hardware issues, hot tip, avoid manufacturer warranties, complain to amazon and get a new one shipped...<br/><br/>I did end up buying another for a family member (50+) and installed Zorin on theirs as well, after a week they say its their favorite laptop ever so take that as you will.</span>

<span>UPDATE Jan 2022:<br/>After two years of using it gently, a bit of plastic broke from the lower right section of the screen. Apparently that tiny piece of plastic supports the screen, because when I opened the laptop later, part of the screen (which is glass) shattered!<br/>I didn't force it and didn't drop the laptop. Not even once. TERRIBLE design.<br/>---------------------------------------<br/>This is my first Chromebook and I bought it to replace a 2014 Macbook Air. I read tons of reviews before making the purchase and watched every single Youtube video reviewing it. After a couple of days of usage, this are the things I like and dislike the most about this device.<br/><br/>What I like:<br/>- You can get that premium feel right out of the box. Given the price tag, one wouldn't expect this, but it feels amazing. The chassis is metal on top (maybe aluminium?) and plastic on the bottom part. All fells solid, even the hinge. I absolutely agree with other reviews.<br/>- Comfortable keyboard. It's easy to write on it, the keys have a long travel and feel solid enough. Many reviews spend some time explaining this, and the laptop didn't let me down.<br/>- Crisp screen with relatively small bezels (less than 1/2¨).<br/>- Great performance. I was worried about the 4 GB ram and not a possibility to expand it. However, I've had no issues, even with 8-10 tabs open in chrome and two Youtube videos in parallel. That i3 together with chrome OS does an amazing job.<br/>- USB-C charging port on either side.<br/><br/>What I dislike:<br/>- The touchpad is okay. Is not a bad touchpad and its quite big, but compared with any Macbook you feel the difference. I'm getting used to it but it doesn't feel as responsive as I want it to be.<br/>- The camera is average. Compared with the 2014 MBA's camera, its crappy.<br/>- The screen is very shiny. Watching videos with a light in the background will definitely bother you. Using it outside will make it even worse.<br/>- Its heavy to be used in tablet mode. So, in my opinion, the touch screen is not necessary at all.<br/>- I can hear a high pitched, very faint noise on the back of the laptop. I don't know if this is the processor or the fan or what, but in a quiet room I find it annoying. Some other reviews also mentioned this issue.<br/><br/>Overall, I don't regret my purchase. Everything feels snappy, and I'm pleased with the looks of this laptop every time I use it.<br/><br/>-------------------------------------------------------------<br/>UPDATE July 20:<br/>- I'm taking out 10+ hours out of the battery when using it lightly (docs, surfing the web, etc).<br/>- I'm confirming that you can charge the device from the USB-C port on either side.<br/>- Feels snappy always: takes less than 10 seconds to boot, chrome opens instantly (literally, less than half a second).<br/>- The biggest flaw I found is the reflection of external light on the screen. It bothers me every time I'm watching a dark scene in Netflix. I can perfectly see my face, similar to the reflection on my phone's black screen.<br/>-------------------------------------------------------------<br/>UPDATE Jan 2022:<br/>Everything I mentioned previously still holds.<br/>Just one BIG design flaw: The right hinge is slowly and silently destroying itself. Aparently it's a very common problem among many users, where the plastic around the hinge starts coming apart and everything gets loose.<br/>I don't use my chromebook that much and I take great care of it, but I still got this issue. Lenovo please listen to the community!</span>

But then again, phones and tablets also crash too so it's not like this is a complete deal breaker. I love how light it is and how well it responds to my usi stylus. Touch screen is smooth and the touch pad is flawless. Honestly the touch pad on this chromebook is more reliable and sensitive than any windows laptop touch pad I've ever used. The whole this is light and the screen bezel is minimal. Also no island keyboard. Keys feel pretty standard but no issues or sticking or not working. Speakers are clear. Screen graphics are clear. All in all I'm happy I got the best of the mid-tier chromebooks instead of forking out 2x the price for a Samsung or 4x for an iPad. I absolutely love that I can access everything on my phone with it.</span>

<span>First Chromebook I've owned so I'm still dealing with the learning curve.  So far I like it. Checks all my boxes.  Decent price, touch screen, USI pen enabled, lighted keyboard, fast. One thing you'll possibly need to look out for.  When I registered device on Lenovo site my device was listed as being out of warranty since 2020.  If it happens to you, you'll need to open a case with Lenovo support.  They were very good and reset my warranty to time of purchase. Other than that, no complaints so far.</span>
