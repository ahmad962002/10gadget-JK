<span> Used this for the first time yesterday and love it! I do recommend using a Bluetooth speaker in addition to the one built into the projector because the speaker is not very loud, and the fan is a little louder than I’d hoped, but the price on this unit to me is well worth it, just so happy to finally view my DVD’s in my room and whenever I want to ( I rent a room and there just isn’t space for tv and all that). It’s a nice small projector yet it projects a fairly large screen onto my wall. I’m so impressed with it, and very pleased with my purchase.</span>

<span>This is one of the best sub $200 projectors I've used (keep in mind sub $200 projectors are not very good.) The auto-keystone works very well. The resolution is adequate for watching a movie, powerpoint, or a game where fine details aren't critical. I'd buy the WiFi model or the M1+ if I could do it again.<br/><br/>--Early on I had one of the "boot loops" others reported. Problem was the battery was too low, and the first charger I used wasn't "just right." Changing charger, using provided USB cable, and letting charge ~3 hours fixed it. It was hard to identify the battery was dead because the status icon appears full if it's plugged in (even if not actually charging). Because, the battery does slowly drain while plugged in.<br/><br/>Brightness is decent, the first picture is during daytime with the light turned off but some light coming through the window. The projected image is about 6' diagonal. Due to the low native resolution and severe Chroma Subsampling text and details on a computer are almost unreadable.<br/><br/>It is very small and lightweight, super convenient to throw in a backpack to throw up a presentation or watch a movie in an austere environment. The lens-cover-height adjust sags a bit so it's hard to get a perfectly square image without stacking stuff under it. Annoying, not a deal breaker. Speakers are ok.<br/><br/>Once I got it charging properly I've had not problem with the battery life, but I wouldn't depend on it unplugged for more than an hour.<br/><br/>1/5 for consumer projectors overall, 4/5 for budget portable ones. The flimsy height adjust and charging problems are within ViewSonic's power to fix.</span>

<span>Picked this up with a great deal on Prime day, always wanted something like this, waited for a good price and worth it. Works great, everything as described. Ran into minor issue and reached out to the manufacturer support and they were quick and informative. Overall, a good technology packed in to a small pocketable projector.<br/>Few points to note:<br/>- Supports Google screen cast (not media apps like Youtube or Netflix), HDMI as inputs; has its own Aptoide app store but has limited apps, you can install APKs externally though (yet to try an app like Hulu that works easily).<br/>- Included charger charges the projector in about 3 hours and battery last 2-3 hrs based on the usage; If you want to use your own charger or battery pack, it has to support QC protocol with at least 18W, all my existing chargers and battery packs like Google, Anker, Apple support PD, not QC.<br/>- Speaker are decent, not too loud, but can be hooked up to a Bluetooth speaker/headphone easily.<br/>- Auto vertical keystone and focus is slightly tricky, I have manually adjust it to project perfectly.<br/>- Supports inputs up to 1080p, but the projector native resolution is 480p, not great but decent enough to watch sitcoms.<br/>- No onboard controls except focus adjust, wondering what would happen if the remote stops working after 5 years, maybe then it's time for a new one!!</span>

<span>This projects a pretty dark image.  EVen in a blackout room.  That's all there is to it.  Not bright enough.  It also is not very clear all.  EVen when you "focus wheel" it in, and at a 40 inch screen you cannot read anything from you Window's screen.  You can read subtitles if you have the screen large enough and dialed in.  It also doesn't have anyway to square the screen.  So you better be able to mount it perfectlt straight line.  Also, the colors are just weird.  Its like they tried to overcompensate for the lack of brightness by making colors to strong.  A sceen that has a slighly blue tint (like a dark movie sceen) will be 100% dark blue with black shadows - nothing more.  Same with all the colors, red, yellow everything is over compensated.  Now, can you watch a movie on it?  Sure, it just looks dull.  The problem is that you can pick up a cheap TV now for very little and even the cheapest TV will have a much better quality presentation.  So, this was a fail for me.</span>

<span>I've had this little unit for a couple of weeks and I am very happy with it. I only omit 1 star because of the fact it would have been nice for the projector to come with adapters for the mini inputs it has (mini hdmi and mini vga) as they are a less than common wire type and I had to buy special cabling to make best use of it. The tripod stand they include is a nice perk, but having heavier material built into it to prevent tipping and moving would have suited it better. As other reviewers stated, if you use any kind of heavy video wiring it'll likely send this toppling and tipping without any real effort.<br/><br/>That said I'm impressed. I hooked this the hdmi out of a gaming computer and played Skyrim on it. Yes the lower "quarter HD " resolution meant the extreme finite detail was lost in the game, but it still ran it (game ran at 1080p) and the game looked solid and text was totally legible. I hooked it to a xbox 360 and ran Sleeping Dogs and took it through some fast driving sequences, and it did great. I tried it with youtube video and also using a converter that swapped vga and analog audio into a single hdmi and it did that nicely as well.<br/><br/>I then hooked it to a ps3 running older ps2 games (the original fat ps3 with ps2 hardware installed in it, not the emulated variety) and was surprised to see it give off bright, vivid colors and great detail.<br/><br/>Running it in a pitch black room is the "ideal" as it will look vibrant and well lit up to about 40-45" corner to corner. I ran it in my office (some light coming from window but mostly dark) and it looked great displaying about 30" big. I tried it with the pc in my basement workshop (a lot more ambient light due to multiple windows) and it was washed out but still very visible projected onto the white concrete walls. Whewn we tried it on the xbox it was on a off white painted wall in total darknedd and in partial (single lamp on) light and it looked great. And finally trying it on the ps3 on an actual projector screen with lights mostly off and totally off, it looked like any other projector.<br/><br/>One thing I appreciated was since it isn't using a large bulb, you don't get the "glare" hotspot some projectors have if you throw the image exactly front and center to the screen. I also love that it can run off the battery for some time and is virtually silent while it is on. Also, hooking a speaker to this via the headphone out jack produced really solid, clean audio. The speaker in the projector works, but unless you are sitting right by it, it's not going to sound all that great or loud.<br/><br/>I am going to use it for travel entertainment in the future, so I got this projector, a converter so vga and components stuff converts to hdmi easily, and a bluetooth speaker with USB charging capability. Currently I can fit all of this, including connecting wires, in the speaker's packaging and so have a portable 40" tv I can quickly set up and run off of 1-2 outlets anywhere.<br/><br/>The bad:<br/><br/>some mild rainbow effects were visible when quickly panning the camera in certain games where a high contrast line or object was visible, but not too bad.<br/>Will do 60fps well but didn't see it ever go above this. Fast full screen movement produces slight blur typical of this since it doesn't have any kind of smooth vision/frame filling.<br/>Adjusting volume and other settings in the projector menu is less than perfect. Having a volume slider on the unit would have been much better, but since the internal speaker stinks, I guess it is not so much a concern.<br/><br/>The good:<br/><br/>Surprising clarity despite lower resolution.<br/>Bright enough to see well in dim rooms, very bright and vibrant in pitch black.<br/>Great color and clarity projected up to about 40-45" but also worked well stretched across a 100" screen (just washed out/poor contrast).<br/>Can adequately display console gaming (at least xbox 360/ps3 and older) as well as pc video and audio like a champ.<br/>Silent and cool.<br/>small (it is about 2/3 the size of my galaxy note II)<br/>lots of inputs (usb, microsd slot, mini usb, mini vga)<br/><br/>Highly recommended for something getting casual use, travel use, secondary monitor for business people, or possible mounted in a kid room to watch cartoons or games for cheap. It won't make a stellar home theater projector as a primary function, but it'll do most everything else well enough!</span>

<span>Purchased from BestBuy.  Very little instruction on use.  Zero Customization including the ability to turn off the auto Aspect Ratio adjust.  No settings menu whatso ever.  The only thing the mode button is used for is changing back and forth between Eco Mode.<br/><br/>Connected USB-A and USB-C with no success at showing an image.  HDMI did work as expected but that's pretty bulky for a Pico.<br/><br/>Overall it was a last minute buy in hopes it could fill a gap and sadly it lacked any control to do so.<br/><br/>Very expensive for an over simplified Pico with low output.  There's way way better on the market.</span>

<span>This is a pretty fun little projector.  Keep in mind, this is really for entertainment rather than work - you can certainly project something like a PowerPoint presentation in a pinch, but the resolution is quite low for that sort of thing on a regular basis.  Outside though of the low resolution, this is an awesome projector (yes, you can get high resolution projectors for this price, but they'll be MUCH bigger in size and won't have the same integrated battery/great connectivity).<br/><br/>This projector is TINY - it's perhaps only a slight bit bigger than a portable battery pack - and very simple to use.  The sliding lens cover is also the on/off switch and you only have three (touch) buttons - up / down for volume and a Mode setting for eco vs regular brightness - and a dial for manual focus control (there's automated vertical keystone).  And that's it.  It charges easily with the included AC adapter - I might have liked to see USB-C charging but perhaps in the next version - and the battery will last perhaps about 2 hours or thereabouts.  The projector is quite bright in the dark but doesn't have the brightness (in this size) to be be very usable in the day time / with bright light and the integrated kickstand is neat - you can use it to project higher on a wall OR use it all the way extended to project on to the ceiling (which is a fun trick).  The speakers are clear and LOUD though due to the size, somewhat limited on bass.  You can connect video sources using HDMI or USB-C and since there's a battery you only need the one cable if you're not charging while you watch.  IF you're using a streaming stick or something similar, you can use the USB-A port (which is ONLY for power out) to power the stick depending on it's power needs - in that case, it can be COMPLETELY self contained which is really nice.<br/><br/>So all in all, this is a really nifty portable projector for entertainment purposes - if you're looking for office needs or don't need the super portability on offer here, you might get more bang for your buck somewhere else, but for the compact size, nice features that allow better portability and ease of use, this is an easy recommendation.</span>

<span>Though this did not come with a remote. Operation of devices is simple, open the lens projector will turn on close the lens and turns off. Screen projected can become massive and is pretty clear. there is no way of sizing the screen, the further it is the bigger it becomes. Battery last for around two hours like stated. Overall good purchase in my opinion</span>

<span>This quickly became my big screen on the go! This Miroir M190 Mini Pro Projector is a cool little gadget. I ordered it to use as a quick camping projector for easy set up on the go but once I figure it was so easy to set up, I started to use it on my living room as an alternate big screen since I enjoy watching shows on big bright screens that are not as high def  as my TV. I enjoy the sense of old school outdoor big screens.<br/>It did not come with a remote but I do not feel I need it. It is very bright for such a small and portable size, the pictures are clear and look good. I have been able to watch my late 90s and early 2000 sitcoms during the daytime in a semi dark living room and I have enjoyed them. We have also used it about three times during camping, using the side of camper as a screen and it looks good. We connected a party speaker to it and we made it our outdoor cinema experience. Really like it and have enjoyed it.</span>

<span>This is a great little projector. If you dont have a dedicated screen for this it will not work great until it gets dark. The resolution is fantastic and the size is awesome. You definitely need a set of external speakers, the ones on here are very quiet! All in all it's a great value.</span>

<span>I couldn't find many reviews on this before I bought one, so I thought I'd leave this info for anyone who is looking.<br/><br/>In a nutshell, this thing is worth every penny of the regular price. It's an absolute steal if purchased renewed.<br/><br/>Don't be fooled by the 400 lumen count. That's 400 ANSI rated lumens, and is much brighter than many projectors advertised as being 2000+ lumens. I bought a 2500 lumen projector before this one, and this miroir is easily twice as bright. The picture is easily viewable on a decent screen in a room lit bright enough to read in.<br/><br/>Build quality seems fantastic. It is a dense little brick and feels very substantial. I assume most of that weight comes from the big battery inside, but it doesn't feel flimsy at all.<br/><br/>Since it is meant to be a small and portable projector, it does skip on a few features like zoom. This means that to get a specific screen size you have to place the projector the exact distance away from your screen. My guess is that this, rather than actual defects, are why there are "renewed" examples for sale. People probably buy these and then realize they won't work in their situation and return them. This is not designed to be a permanent installation home theater projector. If you can be flexible with placement, you can get a great 100" 1080p picture that is plenty bright.<br/><br/>The only fault I can find with this projector is that the audio over the audio output jack seems much quieter than a previous projector I owned. Plugged into an amplified external speaker I have to turn the volume on the projector and the speaker almost all the way up to get decent volume.<br/><br/>If you're looking for a projector to permanently mount in your home theater more than 8 feet or so from the screen, this probably isn't it. If you want to be able to carry a 100" hd movie theater with you camping, on vacation, or in your backyard, then you just need your phone, a flat surface, and this projector.</span>

<span>Amazing brightness and quality.  Def go 1080 or better with these projectors and you won’t regret it.  With this unit the room doesn’t need to be completely dark either. Sound is fine if unit behind you- otherwise port a speaker or buy a Bluetooth adapter.  No remote and that’s fine.  Do wish we could control keystone but most times it’s okay. Battery lasted a whole movie.  Have watched outside, in RV and in house- very portable. Def would buy again, especially with the renewed amazon program.</span>

<span>I really liked that. I also get the extra cable for iphone too but In that case, if the video is not really good, it will be better to use computer other than phone. It's little bit noisy but Once you start to watch the movie, you can ignore that noise, Yes for sure, you will need to connect nice speaker! (my suggestion is Bose :)) It's not big so you can carry any where plus, it's chage last long almost 2 hour (1 hour 45min). I definitely suggest to other buyers. I feel like, I don;t need to go to movie theater anymore unless if the movie is really worth.</span>
