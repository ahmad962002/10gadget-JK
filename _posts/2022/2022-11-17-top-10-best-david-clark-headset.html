<span>Unless you have an unlimited budget and can afford the Bose A20's, or the Lightspeed Zulu 3's these are the ones that most people at my flight school use.  Passive noise cancellation works fine in a Piper Archer.  The sound quality is excellent, and the microphone works great.  I'm glad that I spent a little more on these to get the quality that they offer.  I recommend getting the David Clarke headset case to store these in.  You will be happy you invested in this set and saved $500 to $700 that you can use on flying lessons instead.</span>

David Clark's remarkably well-constructed H10-13S Stereo Headset proves that the best can indeed get even better. With the -13S, the legendary David Clark Company brings users a stereo version of its world-renowned H10-13.4 model. This version of the venerable passive headset still features the ultra-comfortable, gel-filled ear seals and incredibly soft, double-foam head pad of its monaural counterpart; as well as the same M-7A amplified electret microphone and 23 dB Noise Reduction Rating (NRR) for an unparalleled level of comfort and noise attenuation.What sets the -13S apart is its dual volume controls and stereo audio capability for a perfectly customizable, "just right" level of amazing audio. Weighs a mere 1/2 oz. more than the H10-13.4 (17 oz. vs. 16.5 oz.) and costs just a hair more for spectacular stereo sound. A state-of-the-art aviation headset that further raises the bar in audio excellence.

<span>This is a great headset. It fits well and doesn’t make your head feel like it’s in a vise, the mic boom is easy to adjust and stays put, and the volume is easy to control. Additionally, it arrived a day before it was anticipated. Great product and great service.</span>

<span>I'm a student pilot at age 62 and I really don't have much of a base of comparison, but I bought this as my training headset and I have been very pleased with it. Very durable so far and very clear receive and transmit. I can't tell you whether it's the plane or the mic, but listening to my calls over recorded LiveATC, I sound remarkably clearer than most others on CTAF. I have some differential high-frequency hearing loss that's not too uncommon for people my age and the ability to adjust my headset volume independently overall AND for each ear individually allows me to have much different volumes than my instructor in the right seat so we can both be comfortable. I still consider this a good purchase and relied heavily on the good name and reputation that David Clark has in the aviation industry.</span>

<span>I did a lot of research for a good aviation headset to start off my piloting adventure and although the Bose A20 and a few of the high end Lightspeed were insanely tempting, I was left with 2 main reasons for choosing the H10-13s; Price and Flexibility. 1. Very reasonable for the exceptional quality 2. Will use for passenger headset when ANR/ENR is needed.<br/>*The option for the H10-13.4 was $30 cheaper at time of review, only difference is no stereo sound if you are more frugal</span>

<span>First of all, I received the case as pictured in the listing, not the alternative one some reviewers received. Overall the case appears to be constructed well. It has a nylon exterior and plush interior. There is some slight padding on the back, it has a padded handle and the zippers work well.<br/>There are 4 compartments; the main compartment has a soft interior, double zipper and opens on three sides. There are 2 zippered front compartments, the top one goes all the way to the bottom of the bag and a smaller one below that. There is a large open compartment on the back side of the case. I wanted this case for short local flights when I don't want to carry my larger bag and only need a few basic items.<br/>It would be nice if the $350.00 David Clarks came with this case.</span>

<span>I ordered a David Clark Headset Bag for my H10-20.  It IS NOT THE SAME high quality as their previous headset bags.  It is smaller (barely fits the H10-20 into it), it is thinner fabric.

<span>This was the product I have been looking for a long time ... I just didn't know it until recently.<br/>Here was my problem ... I recently purchased a full sized, over the ear headphone that I want with me most all of the time. I wanted to carry my headphones, an iPad mini, my 6s and a few meds that I need with me at all times. I have looked a hundred hard, semi-hard and soft headphone cases and while they would fit the bill just for the headphones, I had no room for anything else. I looked at just about any man satchel that might do the trick, sling bags, messenger bags, etc., but none had completely met all of my requirements.<br/>Then it struck me, aviation headset bags ... Pilots invest a lot of money into their headsets and need to carry them safely along with knee boards, maps, pens, sunglasses, etc.  Why not? That's how I stumbled on to this bag. David Clark has a great reputation in the aviation community and I took a shot that their bag would be top notch. It was a good bet, this bag is perfect for my use.<br/>1.  The main compartment is more than spacious enough to house the largest of headphones, wired or wireless.<br/>2.  The padding is well placed and of very good quality. Protection is more than adequate for daily use.<br/>3.  The second compartment is plenty large enough for an iPad Mini or like tablet or just about anything else like cables, sunglasses, thumb drives, etc.<br/>4. The two front flat pockets are perfect for mobile phone, keys, etc.<br/>5. And finally, there is a rear flat pocket that is perfect for important papers, an alternate for your iPad Mini, etc.<br/>6.  The materials used are top rate, fit and finish are exceptional and the zippers are of very decent quality.<br/>Not only does this bag have a comfortable handle on top, it comes with a simple, strap only, shoulder strap that given the low amount of weight you would normally associate with this type of bag should be adequate.<br/>The bag has a simple, with a clean exterior that won't draw any unwanted attention.<br/>If you have a requirement anything like mine, this bag would provide and excellent solution.<br/>It easily rates 5 stars and is a very easy for me to recommend.</span>

<span>The headset volume control by far has to be the best thing about the headset. It feels comfortable and feels durable. There is only one design flaw. The ear cuffs that are designed in the headset feel like a cheap plastic which is disappointing considering how much this headset is worth. If you put your headset in a duffel bag with other items like books you will find that the ear cuffs easily come off the headset and you will Have to go through the inconvenient of having to put it back on. This is especially worse if your going through flight training and you are held up because of this design flaw. Otherwise this is a good headset.</span>

<span>This headset cover was great when i put it on.. Ive worn it maybe a dozen times in 70-80 degree weather,  barely in the sun, and treated with absolute care being installed on a $1000 headset. It has started to turn orange instead of black. I dont use hair products nor anything to do such a thing. Ive had 2 of these before with 0 issues. This one now is complete garbage and a dumpster fire.</span>

<span>I put this on my ASA HS-1A headset with just a tad modification. It is shipped complete with a DC top headband.  Considering that I put it on my HS-1A I took the pad off the DC headband  and set all but the pad aside.  The way that the HS-1A is designed I had to cut a notch in either side of the pocket so that the HS-1A headband could slip through to connect to the main parts coming from the earpiece's. The pad fit perfectly, even over the original pad on my headset. The pad attaches with a plastic snap on each of the 2 cloth straps that go over the top of the headband.  It took a little bit of adjustment to get the fit so it feels comfortable.  I'll see how it feels next time that I go flying for a couple hours  and if necessary I'll update this review.  As it stands right now I will get this right away when I get another headset.<br/>UPDATE: This is way more comfortable than the hard pad that was standard on my ASA headset. Even when wearing a cap with the button on it it was not uncomfortable after 3 hours of wearing it.</span>

<span>If there's a trick to installing these, I haven't found it. Typically, it takes me over thirty minutes to try and stretch one of these over the earpiece. You pull one side into place and the opposite side pops off. I even tried DC4 as a lubricant but that didn't help. Very frustrating!</span>

<span>If you're looking to improve on the isolation of your Sennheiser HD 280 pro, these will work. They fit easily and I personally like how my Sennheiser's look now as compared to stock.<br/><br/>Although these are a direct fit, they don't come with an inner cloth layer like the stock foam ear pads do. You will have to find some scrap thin material for that.<br/><br/>I noticed a better isolation and sound stage improvement as well as more comfortable fit from these replacements I also see these things lasting longer than the stock foam pads did.<br/><br/>The gel does get warmer with use but i don't see that as a bad or good thing. I just make sure to wipe and clean the oils off my ear pads when not in use</span>

<span>I have had my headsets for over 30 years, I decided to get a new pair of ear seals.  I saw the reviews for these, what a huge difference.  The regular ones are supposed to be foam filled, but they feel like they are empty.  These are larger and over stuffed in comparison and what a wonderful difference.  Made in the USA, 7 year warranty, what is not to love?<br/><br/>If they seem expensive, what is your hearing worth?</span>
