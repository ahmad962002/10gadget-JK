<span>It absolutely gets the job done and I'm happy with it so far for the past few months.<br/><br/>Nothing too special, just a monitor really. The speakers are located on the back, and it does kind of make headphones or alternative sound options necessary. That's why I'm giving it the 4 stars.</span>

<span>I have two very old, inexpesive 18" monitors that have lasted a very long time, but one of them started flaking out when hooked up to my hub.  My office has much larger ones and thought this was a sign I should finally upgrade and get the same screen size at home as I do in the office.  But since my old monitors lasted a LONG time without paying a lot, I wanted to repeat that experience.  Lots of research and talking to other people led me to similar conclusion:  not a lot out there at a cheap price for larger sizes for people that just need a large working screen and not concerned about graphics and gaming.<br/>I had not heard of the Scepter brand before so I was a bit dubious.  But as I talked about my search with others, some programmers mentioned they HAD heard of them and were reputable.  They were about the best price and reviews largely good, so the programmer endorsement was what I needed to pull the trigger.<br/><br/>I'm very happy with these monitors!  Easy to set up.  Great resolution and color.  SO MUCH LIGHTER than my old ones.  I had to adjust the tension in my mounting arms accordingly.  I went with the standard, automatice calibration and haven't felt the need to fiddle with additional settings.  I'm an account/project manager that deals in spreadsheets, project management tools, Microsoft suite (Excel, Work, Outlook), and Adobe Creative Suite (Acrobat, Dreamweaver, Photoshop), and other custom tools for digital design, programming and management.<br/><br/>One thing I liked, and needed, is that the mounting screwholes on the back of the monitors are on the BOTTOM of the screen...rather than the middle or towards the top, which seems to be more standard.  This actually helped me get the monitors to the height I wanted with the mount I have without haveing to replace that too.  Works great for me, but might be a consideration for others, depending on how you plan to mount them.</span>

<span>Bought for my fiance to use as a second monitor, it does it's job well. If you can afford a 140hz monitor I would definitely say go with that but for this price this was the best thing we could find and it suits her needs. Solid colors, works great for having twitch pulled up on the side.</span>

<span>I use this monitor on a daily basis as a work from home employee and find that it's the "best bang for the buck".  I had bought one over a year ago and believed it to be a good enough monitor to buy a second one to replace my other aged monitor.  The picture quality is good enough for my job functions which includes reading/observing on dark and light backgrounds.  However, at times some text on webpages look fuzzy when they are at 8 point or lower.</span>

<span>I bought this to use as a second monitor for grad school. It serves its purpose, but I'm no sure it would be a good choice for gamers (I'm no expert though!). I like being able to work on a bigger screen than my laptop, and it's way better for ergonomic purposes. The one think that I don't like is that it is SUPER bright. I'm currently using the level 1 of brightness (out of 100), and that's the only level that I can stand. Other than that, it's good for the price!</span>

<span>My only complaint is more so my fault, but the stand is not adjustable at all, you cannot raise or lower it or turn the screen. It sits on a solid stand.

<span>This was by far one of the easiest monitors I've assembled.  Literally took me less than 5 min to attach stand.  Love the that height is adjustable and it has tilt as well.  Picture quality is great.  Some reviews stated poor picture quality or that screen was brighter on one side of that picture quality had to be fine tuned.  I had none of these issues.  I simply used buttons on bottom of screen to choose low blue light.  Had it up and connected to my computer in less than 10 min.  I highly recommend this monitor.</span>

<span>I like this monitor. I love the height adjustment! It will be so much nicer than bending my neck to look down at my all-in-one. Hard to find a height adjustable monitor at this price.<br/>I did have a bit of trouble getting the operating manual. Spent way too much time looking for a manual for this model on the HP website. FINALLY noticed Get Product Support on the order details page. I soon talked with a very nice human being who sent me a cut and paste address for the manual.<br/>Unfortunately, I haven't gotten to use it much, other than to check screen quality. I ordered an HP desktop from another vendor at the same time. In my quest to get some questions answered about the computer, I found that HP had no record of the computer's serial number. After some googling, I found that is a thing with HP. They don't have a very reliable system for keeping track of their serial numbers. AND, if you have no serial number, there is no way to communicate with HP. Plus, you have no warrantee. Many people find out they have no valid serial number too late. Even the tech guy at the store where I bought the computer had had the same problem. He spent months (in vain) trying to get satisfaction from HP. I am still looking for a NON HP desktop.</span>

<span>It's fine on its own but as a second screen it is hard to focus on for me. The text is "smudged" and stretched compared to the laptop screen even after changing to similar resolutions.

<span>I got my first one of these 2 years ago as a Christmas present for use a Raspberry Pi monitor.  But since I was also working remotely, I started very quickly using it as an extended monitor for my 14" Windows laptop.  Now that has become it's primary use, and today I received my 2nd of the exact same model of Sceptre (20").  In the past couple of years I realize resolutions have gotten better than what this one has, but for the price and functionality as a work computer, I am very excited to add a second one to make a 3 monitor setup for increased productivity at work.  New one is working great, and I have had no issues the past 2 years with the first one of these I received as a gift and have used regularly.

<span>This computer monitor is good for students and small home business owners because it is simple to use. It has speaker at the back which makes the sound project backwards and inaudible but still manageable. The best part is that the price is right for someone on a budget. I bought it when my 5 year old HP monitor suddenly died after a power outage and I desperately needed a monitor to complete important task. I ordered it from amazon and had it delivered the same day which was very helpful and commendable service. The same day delivery with amazon prime, such a good deal!</span>

<span>I bought one of these C24 monitors back in 2020 at the beginning of the pandemic for my home office setup.  I had an old desktop with dual monitors that I was using for personal use, so I didn't want to plug up my laptop to those as I needed a different setup to achieve a mental separation from work and play.<br/><br/>The 2020 version of this monitor is a bit different than the 2022 version, now that I have them both mounted side by side.  The most noticeable difference is the bezel, which is thicker on the new screen, though better.  Reason being on the 2020, the bezel stops way short, almost a CM short, of the actual display range.  It's just black screen.  The thin bezel, which a good idea, literally did nothing for the experience due to this dead zone between the viewable display and the bezel.  I measured and the 2022's bezel covers this zone.  That gives it a bit more strength, but not as good of a feel.  It also gets around a bit of the false advertising of a edgeless display.  While the 2020 was pretty edgeless, the display just didn't get all the way to the edge of the screen.<br/><br/>I wouldn't use these for gaming.  If you're a real PC gamer, get a 1ms, 144hz display.  That's far better than these, which on their best day in ideal conditions get 4-10ms and 75hz.  They say they are great for gaming because of course they do, it's for marketing.  But just save up and buy a $300-400 display that is designed to enhance your game play.  Running Age of Empires, sure, this monitor is fine.  Running Apex, CoD, or anything like that would just have tearing and clipping.  Those types of games really need faster refresh rates.<br/><br/>Speakers are straight up garbage...I'd rather they just stop putting speakers in monitors and just give us more edgelessness or invest that in a better power supply or something.  I couldn't care less about monitor speakers when Logi sells speakers that are far better for less than $30.<br/><br/>Another major difference was the addition of a second HDMI port.  The 2020 only has 1, where the 2022 has 2.  I'm not going to be using it, but it's definitely a feature some need when using multiple devices on a single monitor (in lieu of a KVM or something).<br/><br/>The 2020 also had a solid metal stand and mount, versus the 2022 which came with a black plastic stand and mount.  I mounted both to a VESA arm mount, so it's moot for me, but there is most definitely a visual difference as the metal one was silver and stronger.  Probably a cost swap due to them adding another HDMI and making the whole deal cheaper since 2020, when I believed I paid around $125.<br/><br/>The power cable on these are not standard...which kind of makes me mad.  Most monitors have the 2 or 3 prong power cables (like on a TV), which is ideal due to the universal nature of it.  I've got those cables for days around here, and at varying lengths depending on my needs.  These come with a proprietary plug and 3ft cable.  That won't work for a lot of set ups (especially for gamers who might have multi-display setups or a standing desk with a limited plug length).  You could always find another one online somewhere that is the same port and wattage, but why not just use the standard, Sceptre?  You aren't Apple...<br/><br/>The curve of these monitors is a bit of a gimmick as well.  I've got a 34" ultrawide curved by Gigabyte and that thing is most definitely curved.  These are slightly curved, but not enough to really have the effect.<br/><br/>Regardless of any shortcomings, these are $100 monitors that work well and look good for office work.  Definitely recommend for WFH warriors or start ups, as they seem to take a bit of abuse (I've used the 2020 daily, moved it all around my office, and haven't cleaned it much).</span>

Absolutely infuriating!<br/><br/>EDIT: Amazon's customer service wins the day, and has honored the refund even though it was a day after the return window. I had waited to set this up and 3 of the monitors worked fine and this one didn't. Thank you Amazon for doing the right thing. I will change to 5 stars after this is fully resolved</span>

<span>It is very light compared to the 12 year old monitor that it replaced. The picture is great for office use and videos. It has 3 video inputs including vga, which I find odd. Who is still using vga nowadays? I tell what this monitor is not. It is not a gaming or video streaming monitor. I am not marking it down because I needed for an office and it does that perfectly.</span>

<span>I've only had it for a couple of days, but so far I'm mostly happy with the image quality.<br/><br/>There could have been more detailed instructions in the box. I hooked this up with the fairly short HDMI cable provided and didn't see anything on the screen, even after reboot. It took me a few minutes of messing around on the edges and back to find the singe button underneath the monitor to adjust input, etc. It's right up front on my previous HP monitor.<br/><br/>It seems like the monitor weighs less than my Kindle. It's a long way since the old CRTs that could be used as boat anchors once they went bad.<br/><br/>Two things I don't like: others have remarked that the monitor leans forward slightly, which I don't like. I want to push the top back so the monitor is vertical. The second thing is the razor-thin bezel. It looks nice, but when I place my center surround speaker on top of the monitor, as I've been doing with a number of monitors over the years, the stabilizing element of the speaker now covers up three tabs in Chrome. Same issue with the camera that sits atop the monitor.<br/><br/>Overall, I'm very happy with it. It's a very nice monitor.</span>

Some reviews said they got HDMI cables in the  box, others said they did not. I can confirm-YOU DO NOT GET HDMI CABLES WITH THIS MONITOR-BUY HDMI CABLES IF YOU NEED THEM. There, debate settled.<br/>  I will add to my review as I learn more. At this point based on how it was packaged, I’ll give it 4 stars tentatively….. more to follow.</span>

<span>Gorgeous picture and great product. Exactly as described. Can’t be mounted on an arm though without a special adapter that is pretty much impossible to find. Even for models one number off, the adapters won’t work. Might be able to Jerry-rig something from the current stand but haven’t gotten that far yet. Not sure it’s worth it. Better to just search for a VESA compatible monitor and cut my losses.</span>

<span>I bought this monitor during the pandemic to work from home.  I have now had it for a year.  It's been a reasonably good monitor that still works.<br/><br/>However, at this point, the ghost images are annoying and distracting.  It does not take a long time for a ghost image to remain after viewing an item, either.  Ghost images are not an issue as long as you just work with typed text on a white background.  However, the moment you are working with images or videos, it becomes a real issue.</span>

This is my 3rd one to replace my 2nd monitor lol.<br/><br/>Great quality, great picture.<br/><br/>Super lightweight<br/><br/>Easy to put the stand on (and yes it does come with one so thank you!)<br/><br/>The price is fantastic too.

<span>Yes, it has the newfangled LED backlights at this low price! Lower than some other non LED monitors of the same screen size.  Why is it a big deal? Because most flat screen monitors use florescent bulbs which burn out after a few years of almost constant use.  Once they begin to age, florescent bulbs start to flicker too, just like the ones in the ceiling of so many buildings.  This flicker will really get to you if you spend a lot of time in front of a monitor.  Besides, some studies show that florescent light is not good for our eyes and can contribute to increased irritability.  Then, there's the eco factor. LEDs use a lot less electricity to be just as bright or brighter than florescent bulbs.  They are also made with less toxic and lower toxicity materials. Florescent bulbs even contain gasses that are harmful if the bulb is broken.<br/><br/>I'd give this full stars if the stand was the same height as my other Acer monitor.  I bought this one thinking I'd use it for a second monitor on my desktop PC setup.  It is close to the same model, but not exactly the same as my other one.  It has the same screen dimensions, but for some reason, the good folks at Acer decided to make the pedestal for the base two inches taller. The base itself is round rather than oval and is an inch narrower in diameter too.  This may make it use a little less desk space, but it also makes it slightly more wobbly on my computer cart's monitor shelf.  Both monitors fit side by side on the shelf nicely though the 'two eyes' appearance of having dual monitors is slightly cockeyed due to the difference in height.  Update: I thought I could get used to it, but I must have just a little case of OCD, because it was distracting the heck out of me in a few hours. I put a inch and a half thick book under the old monitor so that the screens are now the same height.<br/><br/>My old one doesn't tilt at all, but I don't mind because straight up and down is how I need it for where it is sitting at almost eye level.  The new one tilts a little bit, but the tilting is quite stiff. Trying to adjust it makes you feel that you may break something before you see how far it tilts.  I'm keeping it at straight up and down.<br/><br/>I've noticed that the new one has a different design to it too.  It's not glaringly different, but enough that it's noticeable when you look at them side by side. The corners of the new monitor are more squared, the frame around the screen is a little thinner, the base is round and has ridges on the front half rather than being smooth, the back has more vents (a great thing actually!) and is more squared, and the ports are on the bottom of the housing instead of on the back.  This last one would probably be a big deal if I was thinking of hanging it on a wall. Not sure I could even hang the old one on a wall without messing up the cables since the ports stick straight out the back.<br/><br/>Since the new one is taller, I'll have a little more room under the new screen for the inevitable collection of knickknacks that find their way onto a computer desk over time. :) With the old Acer monitor, I'm more limited in how tall these knickknacks can be.<br/><br/>The brightness, color settings, etc are almost identical to the other model.  If I put them on the same settings, they are virtually indistinguishable when showing the same wallpaper.  But, the settings buttons are in a new more obvious place. On the old model, they were on the bottom of the screen frame and almost invisible unless you tilt your head to see under the monitor a bit.  On the new one, they are on the front of the screen frame where they can be seen in the right light.  They may as well be on the bottom however, since they aren't labeled.  You still have to tap buttons and try to line them up with the graphics that appear on the screen above them to figure out what they do.  I find on both that the best bet is to put them on 'movie' mode for my usually semi-dark office.  Funny to see them on the front in this day and age of designers trying to make everything look sleek.<br/><br/>It has a DVI input like my old one does (a main reason why I bought it, that and the LED backlight replacing the fluorescent lights that all LED flat screen monitors used to have.), though it didn't come with a DVI cable. They aren't hard to get though, so I'll go get another one.  The difference between VGA (the usually blue plug that comes with every monitor) and DVI isn't too noticeable in text websites and 'productivity' software, but I'll be quite apparent when I try playing 3D rendered video games on this new monitor with a VGA cable if I don't get a new cable. Monitors that come with a DVI cable often cost a lot more than what it'll cost me to go and get a DVI cable myself, so its okay.<br/><br/>It's a good quality monitor that does all it should for its price point. It's not a cutting edge thin frame monitor that costs more than my computer did to build a few years ago, but it will get the job done for me.  Just getting LED backlight at this price is a 'wow' factor for me.</span>
