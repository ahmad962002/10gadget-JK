<span class="cr-original-review-content">Ya llevo con esta laptop casi un año y estas son mis impresiones:<br/><br/>1. Lo que más me gustó es la capacidad de expansión: ahora tiene 32 GB de RAM (crucial 3200MHz), dos discos NVMe (256GB, y 1 TB) y uno SATA de 1 TB.<br/>2. El rendimiento para los juegos es aceptable: Halo Infinite corre a unos 90 FPS a 1080p y calidad media-baja de configuración. Otros juegos menos exigentes corren por encima de los 100 FPS.<br/>3. Hablando de la pantalla, la tasa de refresco es alta, no es tan cómoda frente a la luz directa (el brillo no es muy alto) y la representación de colores no es la mejor. No lo recomendaría para edición de video o fotografía, a menos que se contara con un monitor secundario de alta calidad.<br/>4. Para desarrollo de software es un gran equipo, el procesador, aunque ya de dos generaciones atrás, responde bien. Windows inicia inmediatamente y funciona bien para virtualización.<br/>5. La batería dura máximo 3 horas y media.<br/>6. El puerto USB C no tiene capacidades de carga de la laptop o de salida de video. Sería ideal que un tuviera un lector de tarjetas integrado.<br/>7. No tiene el switch MUX (tampoco es de esperar en el rango de precios).<br/>8. El teclado se siente bien, el touchpad después del primer mes empezó a mostrar un brillo como si tuviera años de uso, sin embargo, mantiene su funcionamiento normal.<br/>9. No es un computador muy vistoso y la calidad de los plásticos no es la mejor. Más pesado que un equipo no orientado a juegos pero sigue siendo transportable.<br/>10. La cámara y el micrófono son aceptables para videollamadas. Creo que los streamers preferirán conectar mejores dispositivos.<br/><br/>Conclusión: revisar el precio y comparar. Si hay equipos con i5 o i7 de 12° generación o con RTX 3060, a un precio similar, sería mejor ir por esas opciones. Si el presupuesto es muy ajustado o está unos 200 dólares por debajo de la competencia, el Nitro 5 vale la pena.</span><span class="cr-translated-review-content aok-hidden"></span>

<span>I may be biased or underqualified.... as my laptop I am upgrading from is 8 years old and was not a gaming laptop. This thing rocks! Definitely a massive upgrade from my Dell Vostro 3558 with a Intell 5500 UHD graphics card (a pretend graphics card).<br/><br/>I don't play super graphically intense games. I really only play Lague of Legends, and do a lot of computer work for school and hospital work. This was such an upgrade!<br/><br/>League was getting pretty glitchy, slow and annoying on my old laptop... even on the lowest settings. However, I can run LOL on this thing on the highest video settings LIKE A CHAMP! This laptop has performed amazingly in the past week. I hope it holds up well like my Dell did. That thing served me so well, and I hope its good work rubs off onto this laptop, too.<br/><br/>That said... LOL does make the fans on this run at around (my guess) 60-70% speed compared to the max that I have heard them run at during my own testing, but I believe that more graphically intense games would be fine.... for the non-pro-elite-super-ridiculously meticulous-must catch em all-gamer<br/><br/>**** note**** I weighed my values and needs.... I was fine having only the RTX 3050 and not the 3050 Ti.... because the difference was so minimal that I would have never used or appreciated the difference. The difference in CPU's between the Intel i5 5200H and the i7-107200H or whatever it was, was not something I would ever notice or appreciate. I don't need any additional storage because I keep everything on cloud servers. I bought an extra 8GB RAM card for $24 and installed it in 5 minutes in this baby. Can't beat it.<br/><br/>The Acer Nitro's are known for being easily upgradeable.... I gotta agree... it was easy to open it up and plug in new stuff. This thing has lots of connections for more SSD storage if you need it.<br/><br/>I AM HAPPY. Enough said. I will buy another laptop in another 4-5 years and I hope this one continues to serve someone even after that. Good stuff... good stuff man.</span>

<span>17in display (diagonally) that is not touch screen...love that.<br/><br/>GPU and screen work together to crank out 144 frames per second. Played a bunch of Hades to confirm that.<br/><br/>Windows 11 out of the box. Got rid of most of the bloatware immediately.<br/><br/>For the price, I would've wanted full RGB back-lit keyboard. I like red, but this was a missed opportunity. There is a USB 3.1 or 3.2 port that doesn't work very well. Even connecting my phone for just charging would reset its connection randomly every 2-5 minutes.<br/><br/>I got this as a gaming rig on the go. It might be able to be your primary machine if you're into laptops.<br/><br/>IMPORTANT NOTE: Power cord has 2 clicks before it is fully plugged in. Not sure why they did this, but please be aware you need to push the charger ALL THE WAY IN and get 2 clicks from it.</span>

<span>This was the first gaming computer I ever bought, so I had no idea that the plugs were different from regular computers. When I first plugged it in and tried to turn it on, nothing happened. I thought I got a bum computer! I called the number on the package and was told that gaming computers have different plugs than standard computers, and that I had to push the plug into the back of the computer all the way until I heard a click. I thought I had, but when I pushed on it again I heard the click and it started right up.<br/><br/>Onto the computer itself... the graphics are great, the speed has worked well for all the games used so far (Minecraft, Bloons TD6, etc.), the picture is vivid, and I have no complaints so far!</span>

<span>The laptop itself create some buzzing sound while watching video or YouTube. The sound is very irritating. I have tried all the solutions on the internet and still could not fix it.

<span>Bought the SCAR for my Son (August 2022) to replace his gaming needs while in college.  Easy setup and upgrades for RAM and HDD.  Ripped one of the RGB cables when we opened the bottom cover but was able to fix it (like they knew this would be an issue).  Used Crucial website to verify compatibility.  Battery does beat his school laptop (Dell E-series).  He plays Dauntless, POE, WWZ, M/craft w/ mods, and has a  pretty lengthy Steam catalogue of AAA titles.  He prefers this laptop over his Dell because it can handle everything at once w/ dual monitors (he can game and work on a powerpoint and watch YouTube at the same time probably).<br/><br/>This mofo gets hot in some places near the fingertips, but only after a while (4-6 hrs).  The power cable is a literal brick- size and weight.  And it gets pretty hot too, so watch your climate.  It is not supported by ASUS's USB-C charger at the moment, so you can't use the laptop while charging from that port with anything ASUS offers.<br/><br/>The plastic that ASUS uses feels like laundry basket material.  I have a Microsoft Studio Laptop (2022) and an HP Envy (2021) that both feel like a sexy sports car (w/out the engine though because they are weak in comparison).<br/><br/>This laptop's value is a better deal because of the exceptional performance, decent screen, awesome ports and placement, great warranty and support (we've used twice already for mods), all at a midrange price-point.  I recommend this for all casual AAA gamers.</span>

<span>Well, it really is premature to write a review about a laptop on the day it was received but I was loving how it felt in my hands that I just had to say a few things about it.<br/><br/>It is by far the best, fastest laptop or pc I have ever owned. I was so impressed with how fast programs seemed to download and install. It was pretty amazing to me. Even in comparison to a relatively new and powerful laptop owned by my wife, this was far quicker and snappier.<br/><br/>I was disappointed in finding out that it uses a proprietary charger. I was really hoping it would be a usb c charger. Can't win them all.<br/><br/>I had to settle for a non touch laptop. In order to get the other components, the graphics card and the processor etc, I wasn't able to find a combo with a touchscreen so I had to settle for this. But this is not a negative on this laptop.<br/><br/>Even coming out of the box you could tell it was premium. The packaging was really good and protective. It even came inside a soft cloth bag. First time I've had a laptop come that way.<br/><br/>The screen is sharp and very clear. Obviously, I still need to test it and put it through it's paces to see how beautiful things will look but the few video clips i put up sounded and looked great.<br/><br/>Update: I reduced the rating by 1 star all related to 1 thing. Battery life. I lowered the refresh rate on the screen to 60hz with intent to increase it if and when I game. With settings like this, the laptop seems like it would run for around 5 hours but that's an estimate. And that is not bad. Throw in something that uses the gpu and you get very little. In fact, I was running a golf simulator program called e6 and casting the screen to a 2nd laptop screen. In that mode, this laptop died in about an hour. I shouldn't be surprised though as nobody would game on battery power... Not for a serious gaming session. I still thought I'd get more than 1 hour.<br/><br/>Other than that, the laptop performance is spot on and pretty amazing. Crisp and snappy... Fast. Coming from a 6 yr old unit... This thing feels amazing in comparison. Startup is done in a matter of seconds and away you go...</span>

<span>So this was listed as very good condition. Under Amazons description for that all essentials to operat and in good working order.<br/>It came to us on time but its was well used to the point that the keys where wore off the screen was broken or creased you can see it in the pics the charger was a European plug and the unit would not power up(could not plug into power) but batteries where completely dead.<br/>Sent the unit back and 8 days after they received it i am still waiting on my refund of over a thousand dollars very disappointed in Amazon right now</span>

<span>So far this computer has been good. I''ve played Doom Eternal and I am now playing Cyberpunk 2077 on it. The games look great and run well. It's a decently solid machine. I added 2 additional hard drives to it. I did not like how the casing comes apart to add the hard drives. It felt like very delicate procedure designed to break the casing. I got it done without breaking anything, but definitely watch videos on how to do it before you try. The bios is odd, I want to figure out how to set one of the added hard drives as bootable, but the bios doesn't seem to want me to do that...says something about window boot manager?.  I would prefer the old c, d, f, g or whatever it used to be. Sometimes a guy just wants to set the boot order to 1st a non-bootable drive, then another non-bootable drive and then the bootable drive....actually I wanted to figure out if I could load win 10 on another drive and boot to it so I could run some older firewire audio hardware that doesnt support win 11. Guess that I may be too old or not motivated enough to figure it out. Speakers are tinney but ok. Good ports. Keyboard is ok. Sometimes computer is a bit wonky, locks up on weird stuff or won't boot a game, but I just restart it and everything is fine. The price was good. I am not sure why amazon thinks this thing has a touch screen. It doesn't. I just touched it and it didn't do anything.</span>

<span>My laptop works pretty good. I had a couple of technical issues (eg NVidia video card disappearing) and tech support was absolutely unhelpful (after spending a very long time with them).<br/>Check the specs on the machine you are buying because there are similar models with different features.

<span>First off, I want to acknowledge what a great value overall this laptop is. It is specced well for the price point, and the white with teal only lights is drool worthy imo. Their needs to be more laptops with color options besides every shade of black, and 20k shades of grey. It literally turns heads in the library when I take it out lol. The plastic made case doesn't feel cheap or low quality at all. When I got it I upgraded to 24gb ram from 8gb. I didn't know the 8 was soldered onto the mobo, and that's my fault for not doing enough research. Also when I got it I added a 2nd 1tb wd black ssd, along with the nonamer brand one it came with. There's no Xtra thermal pad for the 2nd m.2 slot  that comes with the laptop, and there definitely should be. We'll see if heat is an issue down the road for it.Adding this 2nd ssd , unbeknownst to me they are put into some sort of raid mode,by the bios,not 0,not 1, and it can't be changed. The bios is absolutely atrocious. Almost nothing can be tinkered with.  even in advanced options(f7) anything interesting is greyed out i.e. graphics options,storage options, secure boot stuff. it's despicable that you can't change any of this stuff, and really bent me jaded me on this laptop abit. If your braindead and just want to game, this is optimal. If you want to squeak every bit of performance, and optimize YOUR laptop like I have my whole life, this isn't that laptop.ASUS cuts off every avenue for enhancement, and they use the Intel dynamic tuning, and Intel management engine to put a kibosh on any attempt to subvert this garbage. The screens good not great, sound is good not great, also im pretty sure they turn off some of the VM features of the i7 chip this laptop came with the vt-x. So power users need not apply here. 'Nuff said.</span>

<span>Surprised that for the amount of money I spent on this, it can't run GTA 5 on low graphics settings w/o bogging down heavily in several spots.  This is my first gaming PC so I won't rule out that maybe I'm doing something wrong, but I actually thought I was possibly going a little overkill by dropping this much money on a PC and by picking one with specs this high (RTX 2070, etc.) despite only intending to play what I figured are very modest games, such as GTA 5 (a game from 2015), Halo MCC (2014), and VRC Pro (2015).<br/><br/>Heat issues--<br/>Always runs 208 F (98 C) when playing games, which is very hot.<br/>I only play with the laptop sitting on a table with nothing blocking air vents, occasionally propping it up higher on 4 bottlecaps to move the vents even further from the table just in case that helps.<br/>I tried undervolting it by 0.125V, but didn't notice a difference.  I've heard people say that throttling down the processors will cut down the temps, but that's not an option here because it's already struggling to run 2 of the 3 games I have for it.<br/>Saw a YouTube video of someone showing how to disassemble this laptop to remove the heat sink to add fresh thermal paste, but I've only had mine for 1 month so I doubt this paste is too old, plus I figure that would void the warranty since one of the screws on the bottom has a "factory seal" sticker covering it (Interesting side note -- That's not a problem for the guy in the video since he's in Australia, which apparently has laws helping consumers for matters like these, meaning the tamper stickers legally don't apply down under.).<br/>While the high temps are somewhat concerning, I can't say I'm aware of an actual problem they're causing, so perhaps they're fine as-is (?).<br/><br/>Bogging issues--<br/>I just don't understand why it bogs down when playing GTA 5 at low graphics settings.<br/>I close out all other programs when running a game so that can't be the problem.<br/>I only play with the computer plugged into the charger, but I've noticed that if I accidentally forget to plug it in, it bogs down on Halo (which surprisingly it otherwise runs just fine).  I didn't purchase it for playing games from the battery, so I can't speak on how bad the battery life is.  It probably isn't good, but I won't dock any points in that department because, as I understand it, that's the case with every gaming laptop.<br/>When I first realized it couldn't play GTA 5 at higher (not highest) settings, I was immediately bummed out that I was having to go in and back things down.  Then after finding out that wasn't enough, and that I'd have to go down even lower than what the game settings menu makes out to be "normal", I became flat-out disappointed.<br/>This echoes the experience of playing VRC Pro, which I doubt most have heard of because it's a very niche RC car sim game.  A quick google image search and you'll see how rudimentary the graphics are even at their highest settings.  This PC runs it fine as long as the shadows are turned off.  With shadows on, even at the lowest shadow setting instead of detailed shadows, it absolutely craps out with an unplayable frame rate.  This is more than just an aesthetic problem as the shadow helps with driving, providing more orientation since you're driving from a stationary 3rd person view (like a real RC car).<br/><br/>Based on these experiences, I couldn't imagine being one of the more normal PC gamers that play more modern titles with correspondingly more modern graphics.<br/><br/>***Update 2/22/2021*** My laptop is now functioning like I believe it should.  Here's the explanation -- When I purchased the laptop, I also purchased an extra AC adapter so that I can leave one at my parents' house when I visit them.  Shortly after writing the original review, I noticed that the laptop seemed to bog at my parents' house yet not at my own, and I suspected the charger as being the problem.  Took the charger home so I could compare it side-by-side with the original charger and sure enough, that was the problem.<br/><br/>When I looked for that 2nd charger, all I searched for (on ebay) was "MSI GL65 charger", and that used HP charger was the cheapest one that came up.  I figured it was good since that's not a no-name brand, plus the guy had it listed as being an MSI GL65 charger in the listing title.  While the charger did plug in, and did charge my battery, it could not support playing without bogging down.  The original charger is a 14 amp, whereas that HP one was a 7.5 amp.  I could have GTA 5 playing with a long cutscene taking place with heavy bogging, then swap the charger plug to the original one and it'd immediately clear up and play smoothly.  The moment I'd swap plugs back to the HP charger, the bogging would return.<br/><br/>So make sure if you get an extra charger, you get one that is 20 volt and 14 amp.  I returned that HP charger and already ordered an Asus brand 20V/14A.  I would prefer another of the original brand, but the prices on those are a solid 350% higher than what the Asus is.</span>

<span>Oh man, this MSI Nvidia 3070 Gaming Laptop is exhilarating. I have the capability to run Ultra graphics/ RTX graphics and 144hz. The storage is a bit small for my liking, I plan to soon upgrade my storage and RAM capacity. The CPU, Core i7 11th Gen, is a beast. I purchased the “Used “Like New,” so I obtained this at an affordable price ($1.2k). 2weeks in, I am experiencing no issues. Win 10 can easily be changed to Win 11 for free. The MSI Center application is very resourceful, that’s where you can change the keyboard color and configure/monitor other goodie’s.<br/><br/>Overall, if you’re looking for a gaming laptop that’s very powerful and has a decent price tag, I 100% recommended this rig.</span>

<span>I know MSI haven't been in the gaming computer business that long, but they have a great reputation as a motherboard manufacturer, so based on that, I decided to try them out. I'm glad I did. I've been surprised at how very, very good this laptop is.<br/><br/>Graphics - the RTX 3070 handles Cyberpunk (ray tracing off) at a consistent 75 fps, FFXIV on maximum settings runs at 140+ fps, GTA V on maximum settings runs at 80+ fps, Witcher 3 runs at 90+ fps, etc. all on max/ultra settings.<br/><br/>Processor - I haven't run into anything that's slowed it down yet.<br/><br/>RAM - 16GB has been fine. I haven't run into any need for more based on the games I play.<br/><br/>Storage - the 512 GB turned out to be a little small for my needs, so I had to add a WD Black SSD and swap that to my main drive, though it's not MSI's fault that I didn't buy a big enough drive.<br/><br/>Monitor - Has great blacks and contrast, but no touchscreen. I don't care about that, though.<br/><br/>Build - the shell is made of a sort of brittle plastic that cracked with I was peeling the bottom off to add the new hard drive. Don't expect it to survive a drop.<br/><br/>Battery - I honestly don't know. I wanted a laptop because I have a home base with a monitor and keyboard, but I also need to move from desk to desk where I always have a power supply. I rarely need to use it on the go, per se. I've read it can be low, though.<br/><br/>So, based on my needs, I'm super happy with how this laptop performs. If you really wanted to spend an extra $2000+ to push those FPS into the 200+ range, I guess you could, but I don't really see the need. Very strongly recommended!</span>

<span>REASON FOR PURCHASE - I purchased this laptop because my Dell XPS 8100 desktop kept freezing/restarting several times a day.  A fresh clean re-install of Windows 10 was not remedying the situation, and I had no desire to troubleshoot every component to see what was the underlying problem.  Overall, this issue was seriously affecting my productivity, as well as sanity.<br/><br/>POTENTIAL ALTERNATIVES - I was mainly looking for a desktop replacement - not a laptop.  I checked Dell, Amazon, BestBuy, as well as other 'PC build' websites such as 'ibuypower', but found prices too high overall.  Basically, the price was the driving factor for me in purchasing this laptop.  The final price was slightly under $1,300 w/ taxes, and I found that to be a fair price for performance ratio.<br/><br/>MUST HAVES - Since this was my first PC replacement in nearly 10-years, I wanted to make sure I got a 11th Gen i7 Intel processor, as well as an RTX 3000 series graphics card.  I was looking for a RTX 3060ti minimum, but I could not find a match within my budget.<br/><br/>PREVIOUS HARDWARE - My Dell XPS 8100 was still using the 1st Gen i5 650 processor, with a PNY GTX 970 updated graphics card.  I honestly would have gone another year or two before changing my PC, if these freezing problems were not there.<br/><br/>FIRST IMPRESSIONS - Seems well built - I also liked the keyboard lighting.  Chassis seems solid, and I liked all the available ports on the sides.  The design was appealing, being perfectly rectangle with the lid closed - no protruding sections to put the shape out of balance.<br/><br/>HOW IT IS USED - I use this laptop as a desktop replacement - I only open the screen lid to power it on.  Otherwise, I use an external monitor and keyboard.<br/><br/>HOW OFTEN USED - I keep this laptop on for at least 8-hours a day.  It was purchased roughly a month ago, so it's been used rather frequently.<br/><br/>GAMING (@ 1080p only) - It is a notable upgrade from my Dell.  Previously in games like WoW or FFXIV, I was getting under 60 FPS frequently in crowded areas.  Now, I get dizzy by how quickly the screen rotates in-game, forcing me to lower the mouse-sensitivity.  In WoW, I am constantly at 100 FPS with the occasional dips to 90 FPS.  I'm also currently playing Ubisoft's 'The Division', but the max I can get is 60 FPS with regular dips to 47 FPS @ medium settings.  Not killer performance, but a huge upgrade nevertheless.<br/><br/>FAN NOISE - For everyday non-gaming use (i.e., web browsing), it is a low hum you can only hear if you're within 20-inches to the laptop.  When gaming, it can ramp up to a constant loud whirl.<br/><br/>HEAT - Similarly to fan noise, heat is negligible for non-gaming use.  For gaming, it can get warm over time, but I use this product: 'Zimilar Monitor Stand Riser', to keep it propped up for heat dissipation.  It seems to work well in keeping this laptop cool.<br/><br/>STORAGE - It only comes with one 512GB M.2 device, so storage for my gaming needs is very limited.  I looked at YouTube videos to see if it can be upgraded, but it honestly looked like a PITA to do so.  So, I have invested in external SSD solutions for space.<br/><br/>WIFI – My router is roughly 25-feet away (through walls), but I get consistent download/upload speeds with the occasional dip.  No major connection loss or issues otherwise.<br/><br/>BLOATWARE - It comes with a lot of MSi propriety software, as well as Norton Security Suite.  Also, a trial version of Microsoft Office 365.  I spent a good amount of time sorting through, and uninstalling a lot of them.<br/><br/>BATTERY - I've only tested it off the plug once.  Even without gaming, it was eating through the battery pretty quickly.  I surmise it'd only go about 3-hours before draining out.  This laptop is definitely not recommended if longevity off the plug is a priority of yours.<br/><br/>PROBLEMS – The only ‘issue’ I’ve come across is if I’ve gamed for a long period of time, or I’ve been moving large files around.  The performance of the laptop may drop significantly.  I remedy this by a simple reboot, which clears up the issue.  Also to note, this laptop has not frozen on me once.<br/><br/>CONCLUSION - When I purchased this laptop, I considered it an intermediary, until I gathered the necessary funds to invest in a desktop with a minimum of RTX 3070.  However, it has proven to be a mini-powerhouse.  I don't play above 1080p, and I can live with medium-settings if performance seems to dip.  It performs excellently on non-gaming tasks, and I now have a mobile gaming platform if I want to take it to a friend's house.  All-in-all, I am quite satisfied with my purchase, and may now wait until the RTX 4000 series come out before I consider a desktop.<br/><br/>Overall, highly recommended for purchase.<br/>--------------------------------------------------<br/><br/>UPDATE 08/28/2022<br/><br/>CURRENT STATUS - Yes, it's still working fine.  Performance has not dipped, and I only re-installed Windows 11 once because I replaced the 512GB M.2 with a 'Samsung 970 EVO 2TB' several months ago.  Also, despite being on 8-hours a day or more, the keyboard LEDs are still functioning bright.  That's more than 2,900-hours that this laptop has been on since its purchase.<br/><br/>HARDWARE ISSUES - None.  Screen, ports, fans, WiFi, Bluetooth, and trackpad are all still working fine - of course given the caveat that I still strictly use an external keyboard/mouse/monitor setup.<br/><br/>NEW REVELATIONS - Only one.  Gaming off the AC Adaptor is a fool's errand.  Performance throttled severely after 10-minutes because the laptop was getting so hot, and the battery lasted no more than 35-minutes tops.  This was while playing 'Aliens: Fireteam' on Steam.<br/><br/>PRODUCT OVERVIEW - I am still happy with my purchase and see no need to change for several more years.  Of course, if I find myself with a lot of disposable income, I can see myself getting a new gaming desktop.  But beyond that scenario, I am perfectly content with its performance and durability.</span>

<span>I love MSI, I really do, but as many know, MSI isn't the best, but it works beautifully. At first I kept running into a blue screen, but after updating all the drives, it works great, just got to keep it up to date or you will get a blue screen and your computer will restart. The anti glare screen was the very first thing I notices. The main down fall with this computer is the battery. It is absolutely horrible. The fans are a little loud, but they work okay. I did notice that my computer likes to over heat, but with the boost cool on the MSI Drangon Application on the PC, it will cool your laptop quickly, just don't forget to turn it off lol. But over all, a great piece of equipment, and can't wait to see what else MSI has to offer</span>

<span>Not gonna lie, super impressed with this laptop. Was considering an HP Spectre or Galaxy Book Pro, but stumbled across this on here of all places. It had everything i was looking for &amp; more than what I even realized.<br/><br/>Presentation in box was nice. Like how it is packaged in a dust sleeve &amp; even has a dust sleeve in-between screen &amp; keyboard. Major plus mark for that alone.<br/><br/>Upon booting first time &amp; getting initially set up, enjoyed how nice the screen is. IPS is the way to go, ngl. Keyboard light &amp; RGB options are a major upgrade for my use. Selection of apps &amp; programs from the get go are too numerous to mention, but is nice to have plenty of options. After removing what didn't interest me, proceeded with updates, as you should with any device.<br/><br/>This thing seems like Sonic... GOTTA GO FAST!<br/><br/>Dragon Center App has tons of various tweaks &amp; options for things like Keyboard RGB light, Power/ Battery, Performance, etc. Definite plus for that alone. Some people can't stand it, so I'll leave that up to particular preference.<br/><br/>Yes, the fans can he EXTREMELY NOISY... BUT for my particular usage &amp; wants in a laptop, quite a fair trade off. Only way they get THAT noisy, is if you select extreme performance/ cooler boost. A good pair of headphones would drown that noise.<br/><br/>Another surprise, is that you can run android games either through The appropriate MSI app or even Bluestacks... was not aware of when I decided to purchase, but cool nonetheless. I would say remove the MSI App Player &amp; just use true Bluestacks, if you want to mess with Amdroid emulation<br/><br/>With this, I plan on investing in Steam, finally. Not to mention, can't wait to see what this thing can handle, emulation-wise (Can't wait to try Stepmania on this). [Edit/ Update 9/7/21 -Stepmania runs just like arcade Dance Dance Revolution on MAX graphical program settings. Just a little side note, SOME games that have a max refresh rate of 60hz may have graphical issues... I'm specifically mentioning Sonic Adventure &amp; Adcenture 2 for PC being OVERLY FAST. There are workarounds to get said games working perfectly.]<br/><br/>Build seems solid. Got the Gray version &amp; am not disappointed at all by my choice. It has a nice blue tinit to it.<br/><br/>[Update 9/7/21- Dont expect to get a ton of battery use out of this thing. Setting battery saver settings via windows &amp; dragon center to as max as possible &amp; lowering screen brightness might get 6 to 8 hours of battery life, with just normal, no gaming computer use. Thankfully you can calibrate battery when needed to extend the service life of it.] [Another note: if you run demanding thinga in this, it will get hot to hold. My suggestion, buy a GOOD laptop stand with fan cooling. I would suggedt KLIM Ultimate RGB for if you are a gamer that plays less demaning games. Binding of Isaac, Emulation, etc. Said cooler would probably be good for some demanding games too, with Cooler Boost function turned on to help get some extra airflow]<br/><br/>This may be The best "budget" gaming laptop out there atm. Got the 512 GB Model with 16 GB ram &amp; the RTX 3060. Going to eventually go overkill with max ram &amp; a 2 tb Samsung SSD. Can't wait to see what this thing can unleash then... but for now, happy camper!</span>

<span>I’m actually very impressed with this laptop. I got it as at the time I didn’t have the money for an actual desktop, but the longer I have it the less I care about getting a desktop. It’s fast, I’ve never had an issue with memory, and it runs all the games I’ve ever wanted. I play minecraft at almost max settings, apex never lags, rpgs are beautiful.<br/>20/10 buy it.</span>

<span>Lenovo Computer Review<br/><br/>I’m no IT guru, so this is a total non-techy user review.  I’ve owned and used this laptop computer September of 2021, and I love it!  It was well past time for an upgrade, and I spent a lot of time looking at laptops, trying to decide what fit my needs and wants best.  I narrowed it down to a few from Asus, Dell, Acer, and Lenovo.  Even though this is marketed as a gaming laptop, it’s important to note that I am not a computer guru, nor am I a gamer.  I don’t own a single game, so I can’t review it from that standpoint.  I simply wanted a computer for everyday computing and web surfing, managing my music collection, editing photos, and running my telescopes (astronomy is one of my hobbies.)<br/><br/>For my purposes, this computer is fast!  It boots up in just a few seconds.  The graphics are great!  Being able to change the keyboard backlighting color is a great feature for me.  Astronomy is a hobby of mine, so my keyboard lighting is red, since I don’t want bright light sources ruining my dark-adapted night vision when I'm using the laptop with my telescopes at night.<br/><br/>No computer is perfect, and I do have a few minor nit-picks with this one, though there are none that I find unacceptable.  First, this computer came with ABSOLUTELY NO DOCUMENTATION!  No manual, printed or otherwise.  Not even a quick-start guide.  No CD with a manual or utilities.  All you get in the box is the laptop and the power cord/AC adapter.  In spite of the lack of documentation, it was pretty easy for me to power it up and start using it.  Next, the AC adapter is very bulky, compared to the ones that come with most other laptops. It’s about 6”x 3”x 1”, it’s heavy for its size, and it’s situated in the middle of the power cord.  I will say that the power cord is quite long, which is good.  The power cord plugs into the back of the unit, rather than on the side.  There’s only one USB port on right side of the computer, and there’s a USB-C port and a headphone jack on the left side.  I would have preferred two side USB ports, but there are three more on the back of the unit, along with a HDMI port, another USB-C port, and a LAN connection.  There’s plenty of connectability, if you don’t mind most of it being on the back of the unit.  The speakers sound like typical laptop speakers, and I think it’s silly to expect much more than that.  I use headphones, Bluetooth speakers, or I just Bluetooth my music from the laptop to my home stereo system.  Last, the battery doesn’t last long as long as I’d like, but that’s to be expected from a computer with the high-end processing and graphics capability this computer has.  For every day, non-gaming use, I get about two-and-a-half to three hours of use from the battery before I need to recharge it.  If you need portability power, you’d do well to use all of the power saving settings, have an alternate power supply to plug into, or an extra battery, or consider another computer altogether.  Again, none of these are things that cause me any real issues, but they might for others.  In spite of them all, I do love this machine!<br/><br/>One of the things about this computer that was a big selling point for me is that it was sold directly by Amazon, rather than a third-party vendor on Amazon.  I hear a lot of hard luck stories from folks who bought computers from third-party vendors who had a tough time either getting warranty service for computers with problems, or returning them for refunds.  And a lot of computers offered by third-party vendors have been modified by those vendors.  I read a lot of reviews from customers of a lot of those units, complaining of inferior parts being used for the mods.  Luckily for me, I had no desire to return my computer, nor have I had any functionality issues with it.  But when I have had to return anything to Amazon, it’s always been a no-hassle experience for me.  And to top it off, the Amazon price on this computer was less than that offered directly from Lenovo.<br/><br/>What I like:<br/>Looks great!<br/>It’s fast!  Boots up in only a few seconds.<br/>Graphics are top notch.<br/>WIFI and Bluetooth work well<br/>Keyboard backlighting colors are changeable (red is my preference)<br/>10-key pad on keyboard (I use this a lot!)<br/>Sold directly by Amazon (at least it was when I bought mine)<br/><br/>What I don’t like:<br/>NO documentation<br/>The battery could last longer<br/>Most of the connectivity ports are on the back of the computer<br/>Bulky AC adapter<br/>Annoying occasional sales nags from McAfee and Microsoft.  Fairly easily removed.</span>

<span>It has really good specs and comes with lenevo vantage which shows all details of the laptop and let’s you change things like lighting.  It’s battery life isn’t very good though.  It last about 5 hours under small loads like doing school work or regular web surfing and then it dies much quicker with the fan on max speed and playing a game or something. I think this laptops only downside is the battery. The screen looks great and can be very bright.  It runs very well and the fan can be turned to silent mode which I can only hear when there’s complete silence and I put my ear close to it. Mine came with a 1 year warranty which is always great.</span>
