Extreme resolution meets extreme speed. When Nikon introduced the D800 and D800E, it set a new benchmark for DSLR image quality and super high resolution photography that approached medium format. Now, five years later, Nikon proudly introduces the next evolution in high resolution DSLRs, a camera that allows photographers to capture fast action in 45.7 megapixels of brilliant resolution. With remarkable advancements across the board - sensor design, auto focus, dynamic range, sensitivity, Speed light control, battery life, shutter and mirror drive mechanisms, Silent Photography in Live-View mode, focus shift capability and more. This is quite possibly the most impressive, well-rounded DSLR yet. GPS: GP-1 GPS Unit, GP-1A GPS unit. Operating Environment Temperature- 32 to 104 degree Fahrenheit (0 to 40 degree Celsius Humidity- Less than 85% (no condensation).

<span>I am an advanced amateur photographer. I have shot for many years with my D810 and was skeptical that this would be that much of an upgrade. However, I an quite impressed with this camera body. It's pricey to be sure (as was the D810, which I still love and carry as a backup body), but if you are considering upgrading your camera body, I recommend giving this some serious consideration.</span>

<span>The D850 is a big improvement over my D7000.  Using the same lens and exposure, the D850 does a noticeable better job.  Can't tell if it is the increased pixel density, lack of anti aliasing filter, or what, but a definite improvement.<br/><br/>Haven't used all the available options, but life is easier with the D850.  Focus stacking is so much easier.  The D7000 would do it, but only after being tethered to my tablet/phone or connected with wifi using the TP-Link.  Still not clear on how the length of a focus step is calculated, but just following the instructions have worked well so far, even when doing macro with tubes.  Focus Peaking makes using manual lenses, including the Celestron C5, so much easier.  Nice to have HDR as a menu option.  I do like the HDR option on qDSLRDashboard better with up to 19 exposure available instead of only 3, but then I am back to having to carry my tablet again.  With the improved dynamic range, also a noticeable improvement over the D7000, HDR may be almost a thing of the the past.<br/><br/>The D850 is supposed to get more photos per battery than the D7000.  I think it will but you have to leave the live view/touch screen alone and that is hard to do.  It works very well.  Easy to see in bright sunlight, focus and shoot by touching the screen, using focus peaking, or setting up many of the on camera options require its use.  The electronic shutter, with no noise or vibration, only works in live view.  I can go through a battery on the D850 way faster than with the D7000.<br/><br/>Do miss not have a IR shutter release.  It was so simple and quick to use on the D7000.  Had to do a search on the internet to verify it wasn't on the D850.  Still haven't figured out a fast way to do a wireless shutter release.  Snapbridge is always there, but that is not fast.  You could change your mind by the time that gets set up.  It requires the WIFI connection to work.<br/><br/>The WIFI connection was a big disappointment at first, still not my favorite thing, but I have found a procedure that gets it up and going every time.  Ignore the instructions when you try to connect with wifi.  The bluetooth hasn't been a problem.  Use the camera menu to turn it on and, if the phone/tablet is paired, it will quickly connect.  The only thing bluetooth can do is use the phone/tablet GPS data to geotag your photos, update the time/date on your camera, and turn the camera wifi on.  To turn the camera wifi on select "Download pictures" or "Remote photography" on the Snapbridge app on your phone/tablet.  Every time I do this I get the message that the connection has failed.  Ignore that and go to settings on the phone/tablet where you can now select the camera wifi on the list of available wifis because Snapbridge did turn it on,  and select connect.  Then go back to Snapbridge, select "Remote photography" and it will connect.  Haven't found Snapbridge to be all that useful to control the camera so I usually go to qDSLRDashboard and connect with it.  Works great and works every time, but why can't I just have a menu option, ON THE CAMERA, to turn the wifi on and off.<br/><br/>The other annoyance with the D850 was the cover for the hot shoe not being provided.  I thought at first it must have been left out when the camera was packaged.  Nope.  You just don't get one.  Over $3000 dollars for a camera and you have to get your own cover for the hot shoe.  This is not my first new Nikon camera but it is the most expensive.  I am almost positive this is the first time I had to go find my own hot shoe cover.  It is a nice cover.<br/><br/>Hopefully Nikon continues updating Snapbridge and the D850.  I do like the camera, but I will still find uses for the D7000, like long range backpacking, since it is lighter and easier on batteries.  But then again, the D850 is only about 1 lbs heavier and I think I could learn to leave the live view alone....maybe.<br/><br/>Update<br/>The latest firmware update, part C 1.10, added the option to turn WIFI on/off to the WIFI menu on the camera.  Snapbridge is no longer needed to control the camera WIFI.</span>

<span>This is the camera Nikon needed to release. Please allow me to explain.<br/><br/>Over the last 12-18 months I have found myself migrating away from my D750. For our production company I do about 50% stills and about 50% video.  For video I use my GH5 - which for video - is a unbelievable.  However.... it isn't that great for stills. The low light performance isn't great and as a whole... it lacks the finer points of higher end cameras. So I would use my D750 combined with my Otus 55mm for stills. The Otus is a beast - a fantastic lens that significantly outperforms the sensor on the D750.<br/><br/>This combination of the GH5 is fine for the studio... but when I travel it just becomes too much to carry. For travel I use a Fuji X100F -which is a fantastic little camera. It has a 50mm equivalent lens and produces photos that are the same resolution as my D750+Otus combo but with marginally  less sharpness and color accuracy.<br/><br/>So my dilemma... why use Nikon equipment at all? I am not shooting sports or using telephoto lenses. Nikons are not superior for video.... and some of high end compact cameras nearly equal their performance (if you are primarily shooting mid-focal length primes ). Frankly, my Nikon D750 was ONLY being used when I was pairing it with a specialty lens. Sure there was the D810, but the increase in functionality didn't exactly overwhelm me. So - even in the studio - I was reaching for my Fuji X100F while leaving the larger Nikon D750 on the shelf.<br/><br/>Enter the Nikon D850<br/><br/> This is the camera they needed to release. The new sensor and increased resolution gives me a very compelling reason to use this camera. When combined with my Otus 55mm lens I have something that closely resembles medium format.  I can crop, crop, and crop and still get excellent  resolution and edge contrast.  It is amazing. When used with autofocus lenses (like most normal people) I find it to be fast and extremely accurate. Easily the best I have ever used.<br/><br/>The D850 low light performance is also much better than the D750. Again it is the best I have ever used. I have taken high quality photos at ISO 3200- and honestly it is workable all the way to 12,800.<br/><br/> While the GH5 still has many more video features than the D850. That does not mean the D850 is a one trick pony. I can carry it on location with confidence that if I have issues with the GH5 the D850 can step in (or be used for B roll).  Even better the D850's large sensor can provide far superior DOF control and low light performance.  In fact, for some controlled interview settings I would speculate that the D850 could be the DSLR that you could use (when paired with a high end lens). The D850 sensor beats the GH5 and I would put Nikon's glass up against Sony (but that is just me).<br/><br/>A few things to remember<br/><br/>- Buy the high speed SD cards. They are crazy expensive, but they will fit directly into most computers while allowing you take photos almost as fast as you can push the button.<br/><br/>- This camera will start to expose lower end lenses.  Consider the price of high quality glass into your equation for your overall investment.<br/><br/>- Most importantly... what are you doing with your camera? This is not... I repeat... NOT ... a camera for beginners. I would say that unless you are a real enthusiast or someone who uses their camera as a tool to make money you probably do not need the D850. If you can't answer the question "What specific feature of this camera do I NEED to aid me in taking (insert type of photo)" then don't buy it. Not only do you not need the D850 - it will be a hindrance to you. The menus can get complicated. The files will be unnecessarily large. If you shoot JPEGS in automode - do yourself and your wallet a favor and step down in camera.<br/><br/>Final verdict - A hand-down improvement in the Nikon line-up.  Unless you need the high speed output of the D5 I am not sure why any pro wouldn't invest in the D850.</span>

<span>I have now had the camera for a few days and wanted to give my initial thoughts on the D850. I am upgrading from the D810 and will give the review from this perspective.<br/> The overall feel is very similar with a few small changes. The grip feels thinner but deeper and most people find it more pleasant. FOr some reason I actually preferred the D810 grip. The D850 grip sort of has a square feeling in my hand.<br/>The button layout is a little different and overall I would say better. I prefer the ISO button on the right so you can make all major adjustments with the same hand. The joystick is much better for changing focus points. This could get annoying with the trackpad when you had to make larger focus point adjustments. The joystick makes this a quick process.<br/>I love the tiltscreen and what it allows me to do. I shoot a lot of landscape and I will no longer have to bend or lay down to get a shot. It also allows overhead shots that can really change perspective.<br/>The illuminated buttons are a welcomed addition. I shoot at night and its a nice option to have.<br/><br/>Image quality is amazing. You can see the difference in detail compared to the D810. Its not a huge jump but noticeable. I also think ISO 64 is cleaner on the D850. When raising shadows the colors are truer and the detail is not lost.<br/>Some people have reported over a 1 stop gain in HIGH ISO. I don't believe this is true but I do think the D850 has cleaner High ISO shots. I do a lot of nightscapes and the D850 is definitely cleaner at ISO 3200- 6400. There is still noise to deal with but it is better. One area the D810 had issues with was hot pixels with long exposures. The D850 has greatly improved in this area. There is a few but it is much improved.<br/>Overall if you were happy with the image quality of the D810 or D750 you will not be disappointed with the D850. Don't expect a huge improvement because the D810 and D750 were already amazing with IQ.<br/><br/>I haven't had a lot of chances to test the Auto focus system but I fully expect it to be tons better than the D810. I can say that the camera does a ton better focusing in lowlight. THe D810 struggled with this and I have yet to try and focus on something with the D850 and had it hunt for focus.<br/><br/>Some other features I really enjoy:<br/>The focus stack feature has tons of potential. I have played with it a little and it really makes focus stacking a lot easier. I used it for a landscape scene but I am sure it will be great for macro.<br/>I love the focus peaking feature for stills. I use manual focus lenses and it really does change the success rate with fast manual lenses. I am so happy this feature has been added.<br/>The viewfinder is larger and looks nice but don't expect a huge difference. Its a small improvement.<br/>The silent mode will come in handy but it takes getting used to. I would stand there wondering if I just took a shot because its completely silent. This is mostly awkward when doing long exposures because you end up touching the camera to check while its still taking the photo.<br/><br/>Overall the D850 is a definite winner and I think almost all buyers will be thrilled with it. If you plan to take advantage of the 7-9FPS I suggest investing in the XQD card.<br/>I do wish Nikon would make the custom buttons even more customizable. There is still a lot of restrictions that seem so easy to correct.</span>

<span>I'm a long-time Nikon DSLR shooter. Started with D200, then D70, then D610, now D780. These were and are all great cameras. And with fast and long optics can make great images anywhere. The Z fc was purchased as a walking-around camera. To my pleasant surprise it is much more. After figuring out the myriad options and doing some customization of the iMenu, I can happily say that this camera is a gem. The two kit lenses are sharp, focus is superb, and the nifty utility to upload to a table of phone works perfectly. While this won't replace the D780, it will certainly get a lot of use. Did I mention that the eye focus is amazing? Or the focus tracking. Or that this camera, two lenses, a spare battery, and a travel tripod weigh less than my 80-200 Nikkor? Price is right too. Just buy  it.</span>

<span>Nice little camera. Unfortunately it's meant to look like the Nikon FM2. That camera was metal. This one is mostly plastic. Even the 28mm lens mount is plastic. It doesn't have the tactile feel of the FM2 but it's a modern interpretation.<br/><br/>Aside from aesthetics...<br/><br/>Focus point keeps moving. Need to find a way to lock it without switching off the touch screen.<br/><br/>The touch screen works in some modes, like adjusting the focus point but not in the i menu for selecting things.<br/><br/>As usual the Bluetooth is barely usable. I've never found a camera where it works like phones do.<br/><br/>The F mount adapter is too expensive. I'd love to use other Nikon lenses because I'm not buying a bunch of z mount just for this camera.<br/><br/>Top plate, back, bottom plate are (I think, they certainly feel) all plastic. Very light but also feels a little like a toy. The flimsy battery door is no worse than any other mirror less.<br/><br/>I still like the camera. I just wish they'd actually made it really like the FM2 or EL2.<br/><br/>Controls seem ok, not the quality feel of their 80's counterpart but perfectly usable. Not as good as the Z5 either.<br/><br/>One thing this will do that the fm2 couldn't is preview the exposure. I like that about mirrorless.<br/><br/>Focus is fast and accurate but with a small sensor and 28mm lens everything is in focus anyway. The 28 should be f/1.8 or f/2 but with DX it doesn't matter much. The sensor is so good at high iso the only reason for a faster lens is depth of field and that's not happening on 28mm/DX anyway.<br/><br/>Updated after a month. I had it in the box to return but the photos from it are great and it's a pleasure to use. So I kept it. I was originally going to return it and get the Z5, I ended up keeping it especially as the Z5 is only $999 currently.<br/><br/>Compared to the Z5 the z fc lacks heft. For some that might be a positive since it means lighter. For some that's a negative.<br/><br/>I do wish Nikon would standardize their menus. The focus settings in the z fc with the latest firmware are superior to the Z5 (again latest firmware). I wish they were all the same so I could not have to think about the focus modes and their impact while taking photos. If you're a pin spot focus person you won't notice this. If you use eye detect then you will. Not a big deal though and possibly over time the firmware will all synchronize.<br/><br/>One of the best things about Nikon is the nikonpc.com website which let's you download photo styles (picture profiles) and load these into the camera. This means you can get the jpeg "color science" however you like it. Of course in raw this has no effect.<br/><br/>I've owned the Df before this, I loved that camera except for the focus speed. This is in the same style but with super up to date technology. If like it if Nikon had made this camera exactly the same except with a ff sensor and with more metal. But that's like saying I want my car to be like the one in the 80s but as safe as today's cars. Back to the z fc. Great camera. You'll take as good photos with this as any Fuji or Canon. If you want full frame for the same cost but with modern styling get the Z5.<br/><br/>Update several months later. I really like this camera. The original concern about it not being hefty and made of metal has left me. I find it a joy to use and am finding myself ignoring other cameras and using the z fc. I use the 28 and 40mm lenses and both are superb. One reason I use this over the other Z or even D series cameras is this has the best face/eye focus tracking of any that I've used (I've not tried the z9). It's faster and better able to find the eye than the others. Even with the latest firmware in each camera.<br/><br/>So glad I didn't return this for what would have been a knee jerk reflex.</span>

<span>I'm not sure how much people appreciate what a revolution this camera is. It is 3x less expensive than anything comparable. The same medium format sensor would cost ~$16,000 from Mamiya.<br/><br/>Medium format is in a completely different league than full-frame digital cameras. A 50 megapixel Nikon or Sony full frame camera cannot approach the 50 megapixels from a medium format sensor. In medium format, each of those pixels is huge compared to a full-frame camera. The result is images with inherently vivid colors, beautiful tonal detail, exceptional dynamic range, and resolution at large print sizes (or with substantial cropping) that full frame does not achieve. Coming back to the car analogy, a BMW can be sporty and agile, but it's not designed and tuned from the ground up as a sports car like the Lamborghini.<br/><br/>A medium format camera is not for lightning fast autofocus tracking of athletes or race cars. It is not as easily used for long telephoto wildlife photography. The format has limitations like any camera format. However, for a wide range of uses it provides superb image quality that is a real joy and surpasses anything that can be achieved by smaller formats.<br/><br/>I think Fujifilm made the right decision not to come out with a full frame camera. The GFX 50R is comparable to a full-frame professional SLR in size, and runs laps around those camera in image quality (with the trade-off of tracking fast subjects and shooting at extremely high frame rates.)<br/><br/>I have owned a Leica M6 (film) and digital SLR and mirrorless cameras over the last 30 years (including a Nikon D810 now and a Fujifilm XT-2). Nothing has ever come close to medium format for image quality. I used to own a Fujifilm medium format rangefinder that used 120 film and had a built-in fixed lens (like a chunky point and shoot). The photos I took with that camera are the most enjoyable I have ever taken. To finally have the equivalent again in a small (for medium format) and carefully made camera is a revelation.<br/><br/>If you are considering a Nikon D850 or Sony A7III plus two or three lenses because you want fantastic image quality, the GFX 50R is worth very serious consideration with on of the lens bundles. It is more expensive, but if you can live with one lens instead of two or three and learn to enjoy the method and thoughtfulness of taking a photo with one focal length (or a modest zoom), you might get a better result with the Fujifilm.</span>

Thanks to Amazon's customer service.<br/><br/>I have had this camera for 7 months now and this I love the image quality but I‚Äôve been getting colored spots in my images. This happened on a high profile shoot.  Sent it back once and nothing changed. I am not confident using this on a professional job because of the issues I‚Äôve had.

<span>I have had this camera (and the Fuji 100-200mm lens) for less than a month, so I am still in learning stages. As a medium format camera, this is bulkier and heavier than "regular" cameras (and the same for the lens), so it somewhat limits your handheld shooting. It has a large viewing screen and well-placed easily used buttons for main functions. One feature I really like is the Fuji app that enables you to download photos to your iPhone very easily and also to run your shutter remotely with a button on your iPhone so you can eliminate any shake that might arise by pushing the shutter button when the camera is on tripod. I have a to to learn yet about the use of this camera and lens, but in the first few weeks I am quite pleased with it. Oh, I should mention that the 50r does not have image stabilization, so that is a bit of a downer. You have to rely on the OIS in the lens itself. Given the weight of the camera/lens combination, I have had some trouble with sharp handheld shots. As a result I find myself frequently relying on a tripod, and this leads me to think of medium format shooting as a slower process than with other cameras. Having decided this, I am comfortable with it and have shaped my expectations for a medium format outing differently from sessions with other smaller cameras. Mostly I think now this is a function of the lens rather than of the camera. A smaller, lighter prime lens would probably make this a very functional handheld "street shot" camera. But for me, that will have to be for later. These lenses are very expensive. But that's another story. update: One revision I must offer is that the Fuji app does not really live up to one's expectations. When it works, it is wonderful, but it often won't open at all or if it does it may suddenly shut down in the middle of a job and not restart. Fuji really needs to do some work here.</span>

<span>Bought it from a seller on here slightly used. It was missing the English manual, but I can pull it up on my phone. The camera was in very good shape, as advertised. The last camera I owned was a D90, which no longer works, so this is several generations newer. I like the flip-up LCD and the ability to view shots on my phone via wifi. I bought this because of the wireless features. I took a remote selfie just to try it out and that works. I got a nice lens flare from the setting sun behind me, which is impossible with a cell phone camera. I may not use that feature a ton but it's pretty cool. I mainly wanted to be able to easily download pics onto my tablet while on vacation. I'll get a chance to really see what it can do on my trip to South Dakota this weekend. Looking forward to that! I might try some remote selfies next to Mount Rushmore, who knows? My initial impression was that the camera meters almost a full stop too dark, but I adjusted that in settings. Not sure if that's a default flaw or not, but it could have been the previous user's settings too. I'm looking forward to getting back out there and taking serious pictures again! My Samsung takes some pretty stunning shots, but I miss the full experience of my Nikon DSLR!</span>

<span>I learned to take pictures on a very old Nikon, only shifting to a dslr 6ish years ago when I bought a D3300.  So I am NOT an expert on digital cameras.  But I can say with absolute certainty that this camera is amazing.  I haven't even played with any of the fancy stuff the camera can do, I'm just talking about picture quality.<br/><br/>The three big differences that I noticed right away, just taking practice pictures in my living room, are: more accurate auto-focus, beautiful light, and better controls.<br/><br/>The auto focus is just a lot better.  And it is easy to change between focus settings quickly, which is nice.  The way this camera captures light is magical, I could not have been more surprised by the difference.  This camera is going to save me from so much photo-editing!  And my favorite thing - the controls are easy to adjust while taking a picture - everything I want to be able to change quickly has a button or a dial.<br/><br/>And bonus points for how sturdy this camera is - it feels really solid!<br/><br/>I don't know how this camera would be for someone coming from a more advanced camera than the D3300, or how it would be for someone who is more of a professional photographer, but for me it is an incredible upgrade and worth every penny.  Bottom line: if you enjoy photography and take good pictures with your 3300 or similar, you will be glad you bought this camera.</span>

<span>Just a short review, more of a user experience. I bought the D7500 for a month long trip to Europe. I was replacing a D7100 that had some nagging problems that often left me less than satisfied (It had been dropped - and repaired - early in its life, but was never as good as I expected). Anyway, I filled 4-5 64 Gig memory cards on the trip, and I have to say that this camera is far better than my old one. The low light abilities are awesome, and on the few instances where I needed to take a picture hand held in low light with some depth of field, ISO 16000 was a very viable option. Not noise free, but better than ISO 6400 on the older camera. Other features that made the user experience better: I could easily transfer pictures to my phone - very important to my wife and convenient for sharing or posting to Facebook when traveling without a computer. The connection to the phone also meant that I could share the phone's GPS with the camera and therefore get location tags on every photo. This worked very well, though it is possible that it negatively affects the phone's battery - but my phone is old and it is hard to really tell. (I think the automatic download was more detrimental to the phone battery, and it took a little searching to figure out how to turn off automatic downloads for every photo). As for the camera battery, it was also good, though again, the automatic download seemed to affect it a lot, as did a lot of activity on the display. The tilting screen was useful to have, but not as useful as a fully articulating screen (like the D5300). The touch screen was awesome, and made it VERY easy to check critical focus and work with the menu - even with gloves on. I was in a cold weather environment, so I had gloves on much of the time. These gloves had something on each finger that would let it work with an iPhone, and therefore it worked just as well with he camera. I liked the feature where you could use the live preview and touch the screen where you wanted it to be in focus, and it would refocus and take the shot.<br/><br/>I understand why people complain about the missing second SD slot, but as long as I carried a second card around, it was fine. I never made automatic backups anyway, and I can live without putting RAW on one card and JPG on the other. It would have been nice, but the other features are more important to me. The depth of field preview seems to be gone, and that is disappointing, but it is usually easy enough to take a shot and check depth of field and then take another. The exposure settings were a little more confusing to me, and I could not reliably determine if the camera tended to over or underexpose. I think I ended up using plus or minus 1/3 of a stop a lot of the time, and sometimes a lot more than that.<br/><br/>Overall, I am very happy with the purchase. I might change my mind after reviewing the thousands of photos I took on the trip, but based on what I have seen, it is a definite upgrade!!</span>

<span>This is my second Nikon, upgrading from a D7000 bought more than 10 years ago. We are just advanced beginners. Initially, it works great in taking indoor photos. Then, last Saturday, we took it for a try in downtown. The tall buildings look "terribly" dark in shades and clueless in a sunny day. It was a lot worse than the pictures taken by my iPhone. Well, it turns out we did not turn on the active D-lighting feature. More importantly, if you need a bright picture, avoid using the matrix metering mode (exposure will be limited in a sunny day, as the camera sensed it. Then, for shady areas, it is a problem). It is a lot better if using spot metering.<br/>All in all, D7500 is a great camera. I am glad I did not return it.</span>

<span>Great camera with the interesting feature of seeing exactly what your exposure will be through the viewfinder as you compose the image. Bit of a lag from turn on to ready to shoot but not a deal breaker for a landscape photographer. Had to get used to not seeing anything through the viewfinder until I turned on the camera, but again not a deal breaker. I like the smaller size and lighter weight over my old D850. I bought the 24-200 Z lens with it and find it to be a great lens combo and also light weight.</span>

<span>This is my 4th Nikon DSLR, and (by far) the best one I have ever purchased.  Upgraded my D750 to the mirrorless.  Z 7 II simply works.  Real-time view with exposure is a huge plus.  Very fast, autofocus is extremely responsive even in dark conditions.  Picture quality is stunning!!  Two card slots a big plus for me.  Works seamlessly with my F type lenses with the adapter and it doesn‚Äôt add too much weight to the camera.  Highly recommend anyone wanting to go mid-pro grade camera to consider the Z 7 II.  Worth the price.</span>

<span>Update:  Amazon's return/replacement service is great.  Their quality control for items being shipped out did not catch the problems with the first camera I was sent.<br/><br/>I received a new (this time the camera really was new) camera within days of filing for the replacement/return.  The new camera is new, and has no dust on the sensor. I believe the first camera I sent was used, in hindsight I recall there being no screen protector seal on the camera, and the date and other items were already programmed.  The camera box was also missing the USB cable I received in the replacement box.  I checked the number of shutter actuations with a free online program that reads this number from the exif data from an uploaded sooc photo.  The first camera I received had over 300 pictures already taken on it.  The replacement camera had not been used at all. I don't see the enormous amount of dust and fibers on the sensor that I saw on the original camera.  Moral to the story, when you get a new camera, check to see that it is actually "new" a few shutter actuations is probably normal &gt;100? still might be ok, but if there is visible wear to the camera, return it.<br/><br/>Yay! Can't wait to take some great pictures with this beautiful camera.<br/><br/>First Review:<br/>This is the first camera that I've ever returned (my previous cameras have been the Panasonic DMC-FZ35 and the Nikon D7000, both excellent cameras that I have used for many many years: [...]).<br/><br/>This camera arrived to me with dust on the sensor. Just to be sure it was not the Rokinon 14mm lens I purchased, I took several test shots with another lens, the specs persisted.  I then looked into the camera body itself and saw, dust, dust all over the sensor (it must be pretty bad when you can see the dust, and fine hairs, with your naked eye).  My D7000, which has over 200,000 shots, and which has been taken out to the desert in wretched conditions, appears to have less dust inside it than this brand new camera.<br/><br/>I was so excited about this camera! :( My first full frame, with an impressive list of specs, and from the few test shots I made, the ISO 3200 shots looked better (less noisy, and retaining more detail) than shots made with ISO 1000 on my D7000.<br/><br/>I have returned the camera and have ordered a replacement D750, I'm hoping that perhaps the copy I was given from Amazon was lightly used and then returned, and that the light usage is the culprit for the dusty sensor (and it's not going be the D600 dust catastrophe all over again...you read about these things happening, but until you pay a large sum of money and have it happen to you, you don't realize how awful it feels to be on the receiving end of a defectively made piece of equipment that you've been saving and dreaming of for a very long time).  I'll update this review after I receive the new copy.</span>

<span>Already received it and here's my initial take on it.<br/>Basically it IS a D610 with a new name and a handful of refinements.<br/>It has a new Expeed 4 processor in it which is supposed to be faster than the D610, however I see no differences in start up, menu response time, or menu navigation improvements. So the faster CPU isn't impacting the user-experience with the software in the camera.<br/>The Tilt screen is nice, but there is no LCD protective cover included with the camera. This is my first Nikon that did not include one. Maybe due to the design of the flippy LCD? I think this could be an issue down the road unless the type of glass covering the LCD is made out of diamond or similar. &lt;g&gt;<br/>The Focus points are better but are clustered together in the middle of the screen just like (but not as tight as) the D600/D610 and your average DX camera. This is very odd and probably done on purpose to put us in our place.<br/><br/>The grip is new. It is deeper and I like it a lot. I grabbed my D610 and D90 to compare and the D750 grip was the best of them. Although there are some more angular corners on parts of it that some may not enjoy, but other previous sharp points on the camera (from the D610) have been rounded nicely. [UPDATE: The more I use it, the more I dislike the part of the grip under the heal of the thumb--it is part of the SD card door and really "sticks out" compared to prior Nikon models--a bit too pointy in my opinion.]<br/><br/>There is no little plastic cover for the "hot shoe" that has been in every camera I've ever owned. This one is either missing or they just don't offer it. So I pulled the one from the D90 and will use it. [UPDATE: The hot shoe cover is not included for some dumb reason.]<br/><br/>[UPDATE: The menu system is similar to D6xx however, the Timelapse option is moved to the new MOVIE menu. In addition the name of Movie files (at least the prefix of them) has an option to change the first 3 letters. So I tried to change it to VID instead of DSC and was able to type in the VID letters however the "geniuses" at Nikon did not include a way to actually save that change, so it always reverts back to DSC.<br/>[UPDATE: I have detected no fewer than 3 software issues which will need to be corrected via Firmware update when Nikon realizes and fixes these issues. I've spoke with Nikon on them. Those three software defects are: (1) as mentioned above, the naming on the Video files reverts back to the DSC prefix. (2) The camera needed the have the battery removed to power it off after leaving sit for a lengthy duration (about 40+ minutes) of non-use. (3) The message when an SD card is locked and can't be used by the camera is ambiguous at best.  NONE OF THESE are show-stoppers and shouldn't influence your decision making. ]<br/><br/>[UPDATE: I shot a dozen pictures of my wife on Ch (continuous high 6.5 fps) as she walked down the stairs at home. I used the Nikon 50mm f1.8 lens. Of the 12 shots, 4 were in focus. So the new AF wile "new" isn't much better than what you had with the D610. Just marketing BS.<br/><br/>[UPDATE: I took it out in "my" environment and shot several nature photos. The autofocus was very accurate, more so than those I shot indoors. In fact, sandhill cranes taking off were continuously in focus.  The pixel-peeper 100% zoom in on photos as higher ISO setting (about 640) do not have noise at all, but instead the "noise" pixels seem to be white. My wife commented that the photos at 100% zoom looked "dusty" but you don't publish 100% zoom typically. I'm not sure if I like this or not, but it may just be that it is different (from the D610 that I also own).]<br/><br/>Oh, and the photos look great right out of the box, maybe a subjective tad better than the D610 but I can't be sure, but certainly not enough to warrant a D750 over the D610.<br/><br/>[UPDATE: Test shots taken with my D610 and D750 using the same lens (Nikkor 50mm 1.4G) same camera setting and same everything showed the following:<br/>Focus on D750 was MUCH more accurate than D610.<br/>Colors on D750 were brighter due to D750 seeming to always shooting brighter images (this seems to always happen with new nikons until the first firmware update).<br/>The detail at 100% zoom/crop was subjectively different. The D750 showed more detail near the focus area than D610. But again, that "dusty" look is new for me. Perhaps someone with more experience can clarify what this may be. It could just be a perspective issue.]<br/><br/>Bottom line: If you have a D610, enjoy it, this is pretty much the same thing but with a few refinements and a flippy LCD.<br/>If you are considering this vs D610, get the D750. If you're thinking about a D7100 vs D750, get this.<br/>It is a great camera, great quality but does have some (in my view) missing pieces. [UPDATE: My recommendation to get the D750 hasn't changed, so those who replied to this review with an attitudes that my recommendation was to the contrary, apparently can't read.]<br/><br/>UPDATE: 26 March 2015: I have a "camera lockup" issue with the D750 and sent it to Nikon. Unfortunately for me, this was during the "Lens Flare" issue product recall period. My camera did not have the lens flare issue, however Nikon service performed the lens flare service request. Okay, fine... no harm. But (A) They did not resolve the lockup issue and (B) the splashed something on the lens causing at least a half dozen spots to appear (even at wider apertures). So I had to send it in a 2nd time. That time they did nothing but "clean the sensor" and return it. however, the spots remained. A 3rd trip to Nikon Service and a dozen or so emails and phone calls finally got them to restore the camera to "new working order' (i.e., "no spots") Again these were caused by something splashing on the sensor during the Lens Flare service, an issue I did not have with my camera.  Bottom line, I'm very happy to have the camera back--I've been using other cameras and while the format is nicer (smaller) there is nothing quite as good as the D750 with good glass.</span>

<span>DxOMark‚Äôs subjective measurements rate the D750 very high on their 10 Best Sensors list, so I figured a series of subjective, Image Quality (IQ) only, test shoots of our D750 camera versus our other Nikon cameras (D800, D3200) in this resolution range (20+ MP) should prove pragmatically useful for fellow Nikonians, who may consider buying this D750. Overall I would have given D750 5 stars, but there is a concern that keeps it from a perfect 5 (see end of review). Here are the highlights from my results:<br/>- Lenses: I selected a representative set of Nikkor lenses from our lens repertoire, consisting of 2 Primes: 85mm f1.4 G and 50mm f1.4 G; and 2 zooms 24-70mm f:2.8 G and 70-200mm f2.8 G VR II.<br/>- Prep‚Äôing the camera: D750 is calibrated for all lenses. The good news is (and kudos to Nikon quality) D750‚Äôs AF-Fine-Tune is right on target with the above lenses (I found that the default value of 0 yielded the best sharpness for all these); although for our other lenses not used in the tests (single-focus very wide and wide angles and long teles) slight adjustments in D750 AF-Fine-Tune were necessary, albeit within 2 points of the default value.<br/>- Shooting conditions: With the (short) time I had for my tests, the test conditions were limited to Outdoor scenes with natural sunlight (in the shade as much as possible) with White Balances correctly set according to the conditions (Sunny, Cloudy, Shade). Hence, I would be curious to see other results if fellow Nikonian(s) share experiences with other conditions (especially with studio lighting) before I do other series of tests. All shots (20+ shots per camera per lens) were taken wide open (f1.4 and f2.8, respectively) in Aperture Priority mode at the lowest ISO‚Äôs (100 for D750 and D800, and 200 for D3200) for best quality. Because of the very narrow depth of view at these wide apertures, I noticed that in continuous focus modes, D750 tends to ‚Äúhunt‚Äù for a focal point incessantly more often than the other two cameras; so, after this discovery, all tests had to be reset to single focus point focus on all cameras to ensure fairness in comparing sharpness. Matrix  Metering was used on all cameras. As in a well-known fact about Nikon cameras, compensation for exposure metering was necessary, I had to turn down 0.3 to 0.7 EV for D750 (0.3 EV for D800 and 1 EV for D3200) to avoid over-exposures and clipping in the R, G, B channels. All other special processing features (such as D-lighting, HDR, etc.) were OFF.<br/>- Results were checked with Photoshop CS6, Nikon NX2 and open-source RAW Therapee softwares.<br/>- Sharpness: Since this is tied to the camera sensor resolution, it was no surprise that the D800 out-resolves the D750 (and D3220); but it was surprising that the D3200 keeps up with the D750 quite well in most (if not all) shots. At Pixel (100%) and near-Pixel (50 % or 75%, depending on the software) views in all softwares, both D750 and D3200 are very similar on sharpness (I mostly checked this on slanted edges of objects, which show the gradual changes in straight lines, captured in the pictures); but when compared to D800, D750 and D3200 pictures taken with the two zooms were slightly less sharp and D750 and D3200 pictures taken with the two primes were clearly not as sharp as those taken with D800, especially with the 85mm prime.<br/>- Overall Brightness and Contrast (all lenses): With as much light coming through the lenses as possible, the sensitivities of the sensors do show differences: D750 resultant shutter speeds are almost always the same as D800, whereas D3200 tend to need one-step slower shutter speeds.  Contrasts are almost identical between D750 and D800 and both visibly superior to D3200; except in very low light in-the-shade shots, both D750 and D3200 tend to go ‚Äúdark‚Äù more often than D800.<br/>- Color-Depth Resolution: I checked this in Neutral  Picture Control settings and with pictures that have gradual changes in the same color (for example flowers) by sampling the color code variations (in Photoshop) and looking for uniformity in changes from pixel to pixel. Surprisingly, D3200 keeps up with D750 very well, while both could not match D800‚Äôs superb linearity.<br/>The biggest concern with D750 is that I found (with all shots as measured in Matrix Metering in all cameras and RGB histograms verified for ‚Äúno clipping‚Äù) D750 is prone to have red-channel blowout results in all Picture Control modes other than Neutral, especially with flowers; whereas this is almost non-existent with D800 and D3200. The red-colored flower shots with D800 and D3200 clearly resolve the tiny ‚Äúveins‚Äù and the nuances in color graduality of the petals (albeit D800 is superior to D3200), but similar D750 non-Neutral-Picture-Control shots tend to smear a single Red color over the most of flowers‚Äô surfaces. This issue is not new for D750 (see, for example, Flickr D750 group discussions) and can be ‚Äúcorrected‚Äù by a few methods (stay with Neutral Picture Control and do post-processing; adjust Red channel in RAW (.NEF); adjust Contrast, Brightness, Saturation, Hue individually in D750‚Äôs Picture Control).<br/>In summary: D750 is an excellent performer that outshines Nikon consumer-grade cameras, and, except for the red-channel blowout concern/issue, which can be ‚Äúcorrected‚Äù, D750 is a great camera for us to have as a backup to our D800.</span>

<span>The camera body felt a lot lighter than my D750 BUT when you add lenses and an L-bracket it is still hefty.  It would be interesting to see how heavy it is with the new Z lenses Nikon is starting to put out.  The good is that is has an adapter which allows use of all the Nikon lenses I use on my other cameras.  Nikon eliminated the "scene" and "effects" selections which I had fun with once and awhile.  There are some creative setting found under the "picture control" selection.  They added a "U3" button.  There are two FN buttons which default to white balance and AF area mode selections.  For me they are ergonomically difficult.  The good news is you can customize many settings in other places so I will not be using these two buttons at all.  I also didn't like pushing down the ISO button and having to twist one of the command dials.  Research amongst the forums and manual revealed that you can adjust some settings so you can push down and release the ISO button and then use the command dials which makes it much less cumbersome.  The Z6ii model compared to the Z6 has two slots for memory cards.  And of course, the CFexpress memory cards are pricey.  Some users may just be happy using the SD card.  The camera also does not have a pop-up flash like the D750 which I found useful.  At the time of this writing I can't comment on quality of photos and other techie stuff.  I need more practice and there's been too much smoke here to make image taking fun.  In general I felt the learning curve between the D750 and Z6ii was not steep.  Definitely quieter with no mirror noise.  If you like playing with wifi, you can download Snapbridge which allows shooting with a tap of your phone which can come in handy.  There are many fine cameras out there and different reasons to chose one over another.  Do your research, assess your needs.  Remember good glass may be a better investment than a new camera.  And, as I tell myself the newest and best camera doesn't make one a good photographer.  Study, practice, practice and more practice.</span>

Captivating imaging power, astonishing speed, dazzling low light performance and extreme durability‚Äîall paired with the most powerful AF in Nikon's history. Tough enough for the most demanding professional environments, both in the field and in the studio. Sports and action shots with exceptional focus where it matters. Fast and reliable 14fps continuous shooting. Stunningly clean image quality that shines in any light. Remoteless long exposures. Crucial workflow enhancements for the modern age. The Nikon D6 will redefine the way you work.

<span>I am completely blown away by the AF performance though I'm bit disappointed  with the color reproduction in compared to my D850 image colors. However the AF keeps up with moving subject at full 14 fps burst rate. On a side note, I did not buy it here, instead got it from B&amp;H who offered a cash back amount equivalent to sales tax amount charged by my state. I did ask AMZN customer service if they would match the same discount for prime member. They gave me a straight 'No'.

<span>The D6 is definitely the best flagship I‚Äôve ever used and I‚Äôve had them all starting with the D1H in 2001. However I have to admit I did return my D6 and bought a second D5 and 70-200mm f/2.8E VR FL. I tested my D5 and D6 side by side for about four or five days/shoots. I‚Äôm a photojournalist and therefore I absolutely love these flagship Nikon bodies, always have always will. The D6 definitely does have better AF over the D5. However it‚Äôs not enough to justify the cost difference and for me that was $2900! Or money is no  object than get a D6 or two. I would certainly buy two if I could afford it!<br/><br/>The D6 is about 15% or so better AF wise over the D5, but the D5 already gets about 95% of images in focus. So that makes the D6 only marginally better, but for some that improvement is worth the cost! I already have and use a WT-5a and WT-6a on my two D5 bodies for WiFi transmitting and they work very well even at long distances. The D6 adds this in camera, but only at close range so that upgrade or feature did nothing for me. So to move on I would say the only thing I‚Äôm going to miss about the D6 is the better customization options. From AF to button assignments and Memory Recall Shooting. I don‚Äôt think there‚Äôs anything I can‚Äôt do on my D5 bodies, but I did noticed the D6 improved upon customization.<br/><br/>I found no improvement in high ISO performance over the D5, other maybe slightly better color retention at high ISO. The two share a sensor and the D6 only improves in White Balance. The natural light Auto mode is superior to the D5 Auto setting. However image quality is only very slightly improved over the D5. So that leaves 14fps, yes that‚Äôs obviously a big deal to many people and a major upgrade or possible reason to upgrade. Having two additional options for action images can make or break ‚Äúthe winning image!‚Äù That perfect moment of a bird in flight or football player catching the winning touchdown pass! I‚Äôll admit that‚Äôs one thing I‚Äôll miss, but honestly 12fps is perfect for me. The only other notable upgrades are GPS, longer battery life and touch screen menus! At the end of the day none of the upgrades were worth $2900 to me, I got an open box D5 USA warranty for $4299! That enabled me to upgrade my 70-200mm lens and 24-70mm to the E-type VR and FL lenses. In my opinion better glass is always more important than w slight upgrade in camera. So again get the D6 if you can afford it or have a lot of disposable income or if you find the slight upgrades to be worthy of the price difference. Most people will be better served with a low mileage D5 and a new lens or two. Someday I‚Äôll definitely own a D6 or two...when the time comes or money comes haha. It‚Äôs a fabulous camera, but for now and into the next year or two I‚Äôm very satisfied with my D5 bodies!</span>

The Fujifilm gfx 50S medium format mirrorless digital camera adopts a 43.8Ôº∏32.9mm medium format g format) sensor with 51.4 MP. Featuring premium design and excellent operability stemming from the highly reputable digital camera x series system and the accumulation of image design technology from over 80 years of experience, the gfx 50S achieves the highest ever image quality from released with the APS-C sensor in 2011, the x series has earned high praise from professional photographers and photography enthusiasts alike, due to its excellent image quality and mobility across a wide range of genres including landscapes, snaps, portraits, and sports photos. On the other hand, there were also many photographers craving for the release of a camera equipped with a large-size sensor with an even higher number of effective Pixels, which could be used mainly in the fields of commercial and studio portrait photography, while at the same time keeping the excellent color reproduction of the x series intact. In response to those voices, developed the gfx 50S and the fujinon gf lenses series as a system for photographers that require even higher image quality than can be covered by the current x series lineup.

<span>The performance of this camera is off the chart. It has the best image quality of any camera I have ever owned. To name of few of my favorites: Sony RX1RM2, Sony A7RM2, X-Pro 2 and Leica Q. The GFX has recently gotten me to sell my Sony A7RM2. Don't get me wrong, the camera's I just mentioned all are remarkable but the FujiFilm GFX 50S produces the kind of images that wows me on a regular basis. I am pretty much a pixel peeper when it comes to image quality so it's tough to really impress me.<br/><br/>I realize that I have bought into a larger camera system, but it is well worth the size and weight for (in my opinion) the major bump in image quality. In terms of handling I actually find that the GFX is much more comfortable to shoot than the Sony A7RM2. Truthfully, I hate the location of the viewfinder on the Sony - it's too deeply set into the camera. I always seemed to be torquing my neck and really jamming my nose into the LCD to get my eye into the EVF. The GFX is much more natural shooting experience. That in itself, for me, makes up for the larger size and weight. By no means is the GFX huge, I'd say it is smaller than most standard DSLRs. It roughly the same size as the Panasonic GH5.<br/><br/>So far, I have only tested the 63mm F/2.8 and the Pentax SMCP-FA 645 400mm. The 120mm macro and the 32-64mm should be arriving soon. Hopefully, I'll have more to add after I test those lenses.</span>

<span>I have to say, it's everything they said it would be.  The picture quality and dynamic range is amazing.  Perhaps that's because this is the first medium format camera I have personally used, but I could never even afford to look at these before.  I have to agree that this is not really a carry around camera.  Its ISO performance is not as good as my D810 or A7rii, but that was known before I purchased it.  I agree with most reviewers that this should be used with controlled lighting situations where motion is little to none.<br/>Since I shoot mostly portrait photography, the detail I have found with this camera is incredible.  I really like how simple the camera is setup.  The auto focus is great. Controls are easily accessible, customization is very easy, menu systems are straightforward.  Unlike with the A7rii, I don't have to go searching for what I want to change.<br/>So is it worth the price?  If you are planning on using this like you would a 35mm, then I would say no.  You can get a lot more use range with a 35mm (DSLR/mirrorless) than you would with this camera.  But if you are into taking shots under controlled conditions for very high resolution and spectacular range, then yes.  It's just a matter of how bad you want those fine details for those specific shots.  This darn camera makes me look like I actually know what I am doing.</span>
