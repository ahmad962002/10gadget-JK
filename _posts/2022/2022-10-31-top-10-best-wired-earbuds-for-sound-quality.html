<span>These earbuds are great and very durable it's been about 6 months since I ordered them, and they are going strong without showing any signs of dying out on me like a pair of skull candy.<br/><br/>The SOUND in these are good, the high/lows are pretty much even in my opinion. They definitely make listening to music enjoyable. Nothing is superior the bass is there but definitely not for bass heads these just have to the point where they support to make the music enjoyable. I use them as a pair to keep around when I’m about to do work on the computer or lay down and listen to music at night.<br/>They do isolate noise from your surrounding but definitely not noise cancellation.<br/>Wouldn’t recommend them for working out as the cable can be annoying and if you’re like me, you want to be hands free, so I would suggest wireless earbuds in that case.<br/><br/>Overall, they are good earbuds and for me, they serve their purpose and if you’re looking for something to keep while doing work or taking to school like me these will do.</span>

<span>I, used this product for laptop listening .. have had them about 8 months.. maybe a bit longer .. I, like them, they look nice, fit good but as far as lasting over 9 months they don't .. this is probably the 3rd pair I, have had and always seem to loose one of the ear pieces.  It stops working ... not sure why but it is a continuing problem.. will be the last pair I, purchase.  I, am on long term vacation.. right now on the Island of Grenada but leave in a week for the next part of journey, so no way to order anymore... will be looking for a new brand to support.</span>

<span>At first I didn’t wear them right and didn’t  like these, but if you wear them properly all the way into your ear canal with the proper ear adaptors they are 100% sound isolating and will surprise you with a fantastic sound on really hard to reproduce jazz, classical, pop and vocal tracks. The bass is balanced but not what you want for strong rock or strong R&amp;B. Reasonable price is a big plus.</span>

<span>[*UPDATE* at the end] ~<br/>[original review]: Here's the thing: I really did not wish to be in the market for a set of earphones/earbuds or whatever these things are being called these days – but given the fact that I'd grown tired of barely being able to hear spoken-word audio through my smartphone speaker, whether it was during phone conversations, trying to listen to online programs, or hearing GPS directions while motorcycle riding, I decided it was time to invest in a "workable" set of something that could be plugged directly into my ear canal.<br/><br/>Given that I'd had no interest in investing in audiophile-grade equipment at the requisite audiophile-grade prices, my main concern was finding something somewhere within that delicate balance of "Quality-enough" at just "Cheap-enough," and it seemed to me at the time that these just MIGHT have fit that bill: they did have the "Panasonic" name going for them, after all.<br/><br/>But even I, who actually WAS trying to "cheap-out," was impressed with the crispness and clarity, as well as the unexpected comfort, of these buds. Again, they are not anything to go for if you're looking for Top-of-the-Line type quality or heavy-duty performance... but if all you're looking for is something simple and basic, and yet packs a surprising amount of audio quality, I can easily imagine less stellar choices. My only rating demerit being in regards to the uncomfortably thin wires which easily snag on things and get annoyingly tangled upon themselves – but hey... ya gits wutz yoo pays for, correct?<br/><br/>I'd purchased two sets of these together – the other of which being with the added microphone feature: I've yet to test out that second set fully, but the audio output quality on that set matches this one, so there does seem to be consistency in that department.<br/><br/>Definitely a "recommend" for someone who does not require much but who still appreciates those little pleasant unanticipated surprises that occasionally accompany such decisions.<br/>_____<br/><br/>["update" addendum]:<br/>After a series of hours'-long phone conversations using the "microphone" variety of these ear buds, I was so impressed with the results that I'm literally right now, as of the typing of these very words, in the process of ordering a SECOND "mic-equipped" set – one to be set aside strictly for "in-house" phone calls, and the other as a "travel set" in case of ever needing to make/receive phone calls outside of the house or while on the road.<br/><br/>Still the same concerns relating to the ultra-thin wires, but still strongly recommending for those on a budget or who just want something simple, yet who BOTH are looking for something reliable and of surprisingly good quality.</span>

<span>Really like these wired ear buds for when the more expensive wireless ones are not appropriate. I tend to use these in environments where there is a good possibility of damaging the other ones. the sound is decent for such an inexpensive product. I bought a spare right away once I saw how good there were. The first ones lasted over three years before the glue that kept the actual speaker/ear piece connected to base of the ear bud gave way. Glad to have that spare then and have since purchased another spare so I won't ever have to go without. Good 'insurance policy' to help keep those expensive ones from being lost (try mowing the lawn) or damaged (try being caught in the rain on a walk).</span>

<span>In just the past several years the difference between the least expensive IEM headphones (in-ear-monitor, or "earbud") and the "high-end," premium-priced models (some costing as much as $1000.00 and requiring special fitting by an audiologist) has been reduced to a degree sufficient to "fool" the most discerning listeners in a blind-fold test.  Of course, any failure to differentiate the "cheap" from the ultra-high end brand would immediately be blamed on numerous variables, which are likely to affect a listener's judgments about an "earbud"-sized phone more than is the case with full-sized headphones.  With IEM phones there are always questions about the size and materials of the ear-tips, and the particular "seal" that is achieved while listening.  Moreover, the judgment is always necessarily highly "subjective" and relative to listeners' personal tastes.  If it's not a blindfold test, the preference may come down to listeners' susceptibility to makers' promotional material, the added "designer-quality" features (including packaging), and lots of elitist hype supported by technological jargon based on physics and acoustic principles.<br/><br/>Oddly, listeners tend to disregard the source material and its limitations, regardless of the technology of the transducers (i.e. phones or speakers) used to reproduce the frequencies of the source material.  Yet, more often than not, the source material is compressed to the size of an mp3 file with a bit rate of 128 kbps as compared to a non-compressed WAV or AIFF file of 1411 kbps.  So unlike the high fidelity systems of the 1970s--AR3 vs. KLH "sealed" speakers vs. McIntosh and JBL combinations of woofers, mid-range drivers, and tweeters in a single gigantic cabinet--all designed to transmit the "non-compressed" signal embedded in the grooves of a long-playing record--the "stakes" in today's audio comparison/shoot-outs are far lower and less significant.  Instead of "which system can reproduce the full frequency spectrum?", the question has been reduced, merely, to which system sounds best while translating the limited information of an MP3 file into sound that is most pleasing to the perception of the listener?<br/><br/>With practice and with certain types of music that has been recorded by certain engineers, I'm now able to distinguish between Apple Lossless compression (files of 768 kbps) and common MP3 files (128 Kbps), but the perceived difference is neither habit-forming nor behavior- changing.  I'm still inclined to go with whatever "sounds best" to my ears.  Invariably, I'm impressed by the phones or speakers that, to my sensibilities, best represent the "sounds in nature," ie., the actual, pure and non-distorted, non-altered sounds of instruments recorded individually and in ensemble contexts as well as the complete range of the male and female human singing voice.  But when listening to an engineer like Rudy Van Gelder, who distorts the sound of the piano and enhances the sound of horns to offer the listener clearest access to all of the instruments being recorded, the headphones or speakers can do little to rectify the imbalances found in the source material.  It's when listening to the engineers who recorded "Kind of Blue" at Columbia Records or to the recordings of Roy Dunann for Contemporary Records that my ears perceive the truest, most "natural," deepest and most complex sound of an instrument, or instruments, or the human voice--IN SPACE.  Without regard to "context" (or what some listeners refer to as "ambiance") there is no longer a standard of reference, or a "sound in nature," which necessarily will have 3-dimensional realism, or depth.  Instead, the sound is manufactured and altered long before being picked up by various amplifying speakers in earphones, headphones, or elaborate speaker systems.<br/><br/>In the case of these Panasonic phones (costing $5) and the Sony phones (costing $10--though there are times when the prices are reversed, depending upon matters such as color and supply-demand), the consumer can be prepared to hear full-fidelity music, with clear reproduction of textures and pitches, from the double bass through the piano (and its overtones) through a percussion kit (including bass drum, snares, crash and ride cymbals, and the hi-hat's "chic chic" sound on the off-beats), to the human voice itself (in this instance, Roberta Gambarini's).<br/><br/>I compared the two phones with each other as well as with phones in the $50-$100 area (Sony MDR-EX300LP, Altec Titanium Backbeat UHP326) and phones in the $200 area (Sony MDR-EX700LP).  I suspect that the latter phones not only "wear longer" (due to better construction, thicker cords, etc.) but "wear better" (I can listen to music for several hours without any sense of discomfort or mounting pressure in the ear).  But as far as initial impressions go, the sonic differences are too small (and subjective) to be worthy of mention. The Sony phones are very slightly smaller and more lightweight, which may account for my sense that the music I was hearing from the Panasonics had fuller textures and more body, especially in the mid-range.  To put it differently: with the Sony phones I was hearing music played with stunning, pristine clarity while standing at the BACK of the music room;  with the Pansonic phones, I was down front, practically a hostage to the crack of the drummer's sticks, the pedaled overtones of the piano, the bassist's articulation of the strings (not merely the bass's tones).  Very likely, the same effect could be achieved with the Sony phones by using smaller ear tips (for a tighter seal) and turning up the gain (the Panasonic earphones are a trifle more "efficient"--i.e. sensitive--than the Sony phones, which require turning up the volume to reproduce the same resonating textures.  The Panasonics use a special, "ergonomic" angle along with an "angular" tip that ensures deeper insertion of the tip into the ear canal, thus accounting for some of the added "body" I was hearing in the sounds of the instruments and vocals.  Some listeners many prefer the more conventional ear tips of the Sony phones.  (Both phones provide two additional sets of tips, which are, in both cases, constructed with a stiff center, along the lines of Sony's acclaimed "hybrid silicone ear-tips").<br/><br/>I'd recommend ordering these Panasonic phones for $5-6.  If you like them, order another set before they wear out and the price goes up.  If you don't, order the Sony phones and keep the Panasonics on hand for the inevitable day that they fail (providing you don't accidentally step on them first).<br/><br/>[Ignore the aficionados' advice to "burn in" the phones, even before wearing them.  Even with high-end, costly phones, that's merely reducing the average lifetime of the phones for listening.  Moreover, either of these ultra low-priced Panasonic or Sony phones is ready to go into action from the moment you extract a pair from the box.  (Feel free to ignore the crumpled up instructions and warranty.)]</span>

<span>okay, so first, the bluetooth works better than any other i have used.  it still suffers from the side-effects of all bluetooth, cuts out in the cold, distance and obstruction level to the source but it cuts out A LOT less than MANY other bluetooth headphones i have used.  this literally puts all others (i have used at least 10 sets of bluetooth earphones including many highly rated ones) to shame in sound quality and functionality!<br/><br/>second, the sound quality, of high-end earphones with isolated drivers, this is clearly above the rest i have used.  the sound is well balanced and very crisp and clear for a single driver earphone.  i have the competitions also and i would say the shures have better sound.<br/><br/>lastly, these were a bit uncomfortable at first but when you use them and as you use them, most of it is just pressure points on your ears and they will get used to that.  on my 5th wearing, i was really used to the feel and they didnt bother me at all.<br/><br/>on top of all of that, this is ipx4 so really, REALLY helps make these more wearable because if not, water will get in these over time and will ruin them as they have for many other ones.  the ipx4 is only splash proof and it would be nice to have a higher level but even as that, i can wear these to the gym working out and not worry about them failing.<br/><br/>seriously, i have really high-end earphones for clear sound but these may be overall my favorite earphones!</span>

<span>This is my review of the Shure SE215 in ear monitors. I've had these headphones for a decent amount of time, just over a year now. I've used these in all sorts of different scenarios, from studying, to sleeping, and even intense golf course maintenance. My review will be divided into 3 different sections: durability, design, and sound quality. Enjoy!<br/><br/>## A quick note on the ear tips<br/><br/>A lot of people really like the ear tips that come with these headphones. I used them for quite some time and was very happy with them. After a while, the memory foam started to get really gross and firm, so I decided to research some new tips. Much to my surprise, I discovered that the beloved Klipsch oval eartips fit these buds perfectly! I quickly bought them and couldn't be happier. I can confidently say, at least for my ears, the Klipsch oval tips blow any of the stock tips out of the water. The seal is fantastic, and they're easy to put on. They dont get uncomfortable over long periods of time, and they dont try to push themselves out of your ear like the memory foam tips. They're literally perfect for me. I **highly, highly** recommend you give them a shot instead of the stock eartips.<br/><br/>## Durability<br/><br/>These headphones are made out of plastic, and doesn't contain a single piece of metal in the enclosure. Don't let this fool you, however, these headphones are amongst the most durable in-ear buds I've ever owned (far surpassing the Klipsch Image X10 and S4, as well as the Monster Turbines, which have an *all metal* enclosure and Monster Beats Tour). I don't treat these headphones kindly either. I never put them in their carrying case and I frequently wear them in rugged environments, such as mowing the grass (in 95º heat) and, as stated earlier, golf course maintenance. I have the clear model, which has a kevlar and mesh lined cable. Once again, this cable is by far the most durable I've ever seen. The cable that came with these headphones when I purchased them wore out very quickly, I think it was a lemon. In less than a month of daily use, I found the sound would short out momentarily at random times. Thankfully, these headphones feature removable cables (a feature which really shouldn't be overlooked), so I bought another one and it's been working perfectly ever since. Overall, if you're looking to buy a pair of headphones that will last for *years* on end, these headphones are definitely the right call.<br/><br/>## Design<br/><br/>I love the design of these headphones. I dont really have any complaints, so I apologize in advance if I sound overwhelmingly positive. A huge advantage of having earbuds that sit flush with your ears (and dont stick out like typical earbuds) is that you can sleep with them! It's so great being able to lay my head on a pillow and not feel any pressure in my ear canals. If you use earbuds in the house, this is really a feature that should not be overlooked. Furthermore, since these headphones sit flush with your ears, you can wear them in the rain with minimal risk of water touching the driver enclosures (let alone actually seeping inside). Lastly, the way the cable wraps above your ear makes it very difficult for cable tension alone to pull them out. This means that the buds can literally stay in for days without the usual cable sways slowly wiggling them out of your ears. It also means that if the cable catches something (like a door handle), the earbuds aren't likely to get yanked out (which is usually a pretty jarring experience). The only problem I have with the clear model in particular is that the right angle headphone jack doesn't fit cases very well. I dont have a high-profile case, just a thin TPU shell around my iPhone 6. Despite the fact that my case is thin, it was still too thick to plug these headphones in. The black cable seems to be designed for mobile devices, because it doesn't have these issues fitting my case.<br/><br/>If you plan on using these with a phone, I recommend you buy the black variant.<br/><br/>## Sound quality<br/><br/>Sound quality is highly subjective. What I think sounds good, others might think sounds like garbage. This is why I try to reduce the weight of sound quality in my reviews, and instead, focus on the factual, measurable parts of these headphones. Lets get this out of the way, these headphones are **not** balanced. They have a significant bias towards the lower frequencies: bass, but it can also turn some people off. Unlike some other bass-boosted headphones on the market, these headphones aren't a complete mess when you get to the higher end of the spectrum. Trebles are very clear, sharp, and precise. The trebles are very independent of the lower frequencies (high mids in particular), which is a great characteristic to see at this price point. I wish they were just a brighter (trebles should be louder), but its not a deal breaker, especially if you aren't a huge audio snob like I am. Shure always does a great job with their mids, and these headphones are no exception. They're very clear, controlled, and accurate. Sometimes, in very complex songs, the bass will run into the mids, causing things to sound muddier than they should, but its not a deal breaker by any stretch of the imagination. These scenarios are generally few and far between.<br/><br/>Overall, I think a lot of people will be happy with the sound of these headphones. They have the bass-boosted emphasis of most modern headphones, however, it isn't overdone, and it doesn't come at the expense of the mids (in most scenarios) or the trebles. For $100, you're not going to get a perfect pair of headphones, but you can get one thats pretty damn good for most people. Unless you're a *serious* audio snob, or you listen *strictly* to spoken word audio, I highly recommend the Shure SE215 (in black). Seriously though, pick up a set of the Klipsch eartips while you're at it. You **will not** regret it.</span>

<blockquote><em><div class="a-row a-spacing-small review-data"><span class="a-size-base review-text review-text-content" data-hook="review-body">
<span>Being a fan of the legendary Ink'd earbuds by Skullcandy, I was disappointed when they were discontinued. I had since been on a search for the best pair of cheap earbuds I could find. This is definitely the best comparison I have found.<br/><br/>First off, I read the reviews before purchasing these. I read a lot of great reviews, and I also saw some questionable reviews. However, the terrible reviews that I saw left me impressed because they had been updated saying that the seller had dealt with the problem promptly and had been very considerate. That was a major selling point for me. If I had any problems, I knew from the history that the providers would take care of any problem without much hassle. Fortunately, I have not had any problems.<br/><br/>If anyone sees any review about poor quality and breaking, they were not treating these correctly. After using these frequently for quite some time, I have definitely felt for durability. What I have found:<br/><br/>  - The microphone is very well built. Seams are small and hardly noticeable, making it difficult to separate and break.<br/>  - The buttons are firm (but not too firm) and deliberate with movements, making it feel very sturdy and durable.<br/>  - The connector is definitely interesting. It's a mix between the elbow and the straight connector. I will follow up on the<br/>  review later to explain how this holds up after time. However, it is not a weak point in the build as it commonly is with<br/>  headphones. Looks like it will last a while.<br/>  - The black part under the earbuds themselves are very sturdy (yet somewhat flexible) pieces of plastic, creating an<br/>  environment that is difficult to lose connection because of the lack of mobility, but just enough to not have too much<br/>  resistance.<br/>  - The cable itself is a little stiffer than the average auxiliary cable, making it feel more protected from bending and<br/>  connection problems.<br/>To sum it up, these are very well-built and do not feel like they will break any time soon.<br/><br/>Next, I will address the quality of the sound. The first thing I do with any pair of headphones or earbuds is test the sound. I test the quality and the limits of the sound. Most headphones can reach fairly high sound levels, however you probably don't ever want to because it will hurt your ears or the quality is compromised significantly. I have played these with minimal sound, and I have played with maximum sound. I have played classical music to rock to dubstep. I can say that the sound quality is not compromised by playing too low or too loud. It is just as good loud as it is low.<br/><br/>They have a great range of sound. I have had a lot of headphones that do not have any depth. Most can go pretty loud, but it feels like they are missing something. These earbuds do not feel like they are missing anything. I honestly feel just as immersed in the music wearing these as I do when I use my Studio Beats (which is why I honestly don't use my beats much anymore.) Sounds great on the highs and sounds amazing on the lows. They do have great bass, I'll give them that. I love the fact that they can produce so much bass, but it's honestly not a feature I will use often because they can tickle the inside of your ear because of the bass. In other words, you literally can feel the bass, which is great I think. Just be careful because it can be a weird sensation if you are not prepared to have your eardrum tickled (try it, its definitely worth trying)<br/><br/>Well-made, beautiful design, sound great, no problems so far, therefore I give them 5 stars.</span>

<span>I bought these to use for listening to music in an environment where others are around and also for conference calls I take from the computer. I would say that the sound quality is very good, the highs and mids are absolutely crystal clear. I wish they had deeper bass but I did not expect that from headphones of this size. The wood is nice looking and so far the cord seems durable. I do not use the controls.</span>

<span>These are truly impressive headphones!<br/><br/>Opinions on these things are unavoidably subjective and depend heavily on personal tastes and listening habits, so it's probably relevant to state those of mine upfront: My enthusiasm for classical music veers dangerously close to the nutty edge, as my collection of 2,100+ CDs (about 95% classical) would attest. For decades, I have also attended (and sometimes participated in) performances of symphony orchestras, choral groups big and small, as well as chamber ensembles and individual recitals. So, even though I am not "audiophile" enough to be equipped with headphone amps, I sure know what my music should sound like.<br/><br/>I also have a bunch of headphones for comparison listening, including<br/><br/>-Sony XBAH1<br/>-Sony XBA-C10IP<br/>-Marshall Mode<br/>-Brainwavz Delta<br/>-Panasonic RP-TCM125 Ergo Fit<br/><br/>All of these were among Wirecutter.com's top picks one time or another recently, and all of them I have found pleasing in one way or another. After a few months of living with my Symphonized NRG 3.0 headphones, I come to the conclusion that, over all, I would prefer these headphones to all the others.<br/><br/>The very first thing I noticed right away with my Symphonized NRG 3.0 pair was the exceptional efficiency of volume production. At the usual volume setting I listen with other pairs, these are considerably louder. I like to listen to music loud enough so that the full sound quality of the instruments/voices can be clearly discerned, but not so loud as to bust ear-drums. It is known that people tend to favor louder speakers/headphones during listening comparisons, so in forming my opinions I have tried my best to reduce the player's volume setting to offset its higher efficiency when I listened with the Symphonized pair.<br/><br/>The first few recordings I listened to using the Symphonized pair happened to be string quartets. I was awe-struck by how good they sounded. It took a while before I figured out what gave the additional listening pleasure: The four instruments are presented vividly at four individual locales in the sound stage. And thankfully, this was not accomplished with edgy or shrill sound. The tones are pliant and alive and the instruments are clearly and palpably THERE! The quality of the Sony pairs listed above that I appreciate the most is their ability to render individual instruments with air around them (so to speak). But the Symponized pair presents the instruments with a steady vividness unlike anything I heard before. This effect may be a little less noticeable with other instruments or orchestral sections but still quite noticeable. I have no idea whether this has anything to do with the fact that wood rather than plastic is used for the ear-pieces, and honestly I really don't care. Sound quality is what matters to me.<br/><br/>Like most people, I often wish headphone could produce a bit more bass than they are usually capable of. Here the Symphonized 3.0 pair also does a lot better than most other headphones. Better yet, the bass sound is musical, sounding like real low strings or timpani should, not at all boomy or boxy. It's probably not for people who prefer to hear heavy drumbeats over everything else, but it's plenty satisfying for me. I want the bass to provide firm support for the music, not be the prima donna of it all unless during a timpani or double-bass solo.<br/><br/>On good stereo recordings, the Symphonized 3.0 pair produces the sense of an unusually wide sound stage and a fairy nice sense of depth too. It fills the whole sound stage with a warm, unforced, and very musical sound. Though occasionally I hear some hollow piano tones, I suspect that's more the faults of the recordings.<br/><br/>All in all, I have found the Symphonized NRG 3.0 headphones a very happy purchase that makes extremely pleasurable listening, especially if your musical tastes and listening habit resemble mine. You will find their sounds warm and full. More than any other headphones I have listened to, these give a lot of vivid presence to the music. Very very impressive indeed!<br/><br/>I could wish for clearer indications on the ear-pieces to distinguish the left from the right, but that probably amounts to ungrateful nit-picking.</span>

<span>As someone who grew up in the car audio scene, I was of course familiar with Kicker.  In the day they made extremely good amps and subwoofers.  As such, I was more prone to give these headphones a chance.  I have bought several other headphones at this price point before, to use doing projects around the house, and have been either disappointed by the sound quality or the fitment of these other headphones.  I am very happy with how these headphones fit and stay in place when I am moving around.  I am also happy with the sound quality.  I think it will take some time for me personally to get used to having the cable around the back of my neck, but that is a small issue.  The only other issue I will mention here is that these can sound a little muddy at lower volume, but that can be solved with the EQ settings in Music (iphone).  I assume there is a similar solution for Android users, but I am unfamiliar with those devices.  For the price I gave (~$35), I don't think I could find a better sound that would also fit with my ears.  If you have had similar issues I would suggest you give these a try.</span>

<span>I absolutely love the sound of these earbuds.  I have been using Kicker speakers in my vehicles for over 20 years because I love their sound, so I was pretty surprised to see they made earbuds.  Perfect balance of lows, mids, and highs.  No fake muddy bass here, it sounds real.  Construction is excellent.<br/><br/>Unfortunately they are not comfortable for me to use.  I wore them twice on a recent trip flying, and after 20 minutes they just hurt my ears.  I tried all 3 sizes of tips and the only correct fit was the medium, but they hurt the bottom of my inner ear.  Both sides.  I even tried some foam tips from another set and still no good.<br/><br/>Maybe the size problem is unique to me, but I've never had this issue with the 25+ pairs of earbuds I've used over the years.  It's too bad because these sound better and more natural than any pair I've ever owned.  I will still try to use them, but not for extended periods of time.<br/><br/>I hate to give them 3 stars, because the sound is worth 7 or 8 stars, but the physical pain in my ears is almost unbearable.<br/><br/>Hopefully they fit better for someone else out there because they sound way too good for $15 earbuds.</span>

<span>I love audio in general. I have lots of headphones and earbuds. IAM a bass head/ audiophile. I love bass but I also love pure clean music with clarity. It just depends what IAM in the mood for. But that being said. I bought a pair of the 1more triple drivers, the quad drivers, I also bought a pair of audio Technica. Sennheiser, and a pair of Sony MDX. Then I came across these for $15. So I got them to try not expecting much. WOW! For the price I was blown away. They don't have quite the clarity and crisps highs like some of the much more exspinsive ones. But trust me especially when you're not comparing side by side over and over like I did. You will think these are much more exspinsive than they are. Most cheap earbuds have a more v sound wave. They eather have good bass and good treble but no mids or they have good treble and mids but no bass. These have great bass that you can get into but the mids and highs are there also. I have never heard a pair of earbuds under $30 sound this good. There more than Worth the money. They punch way over there price range. I would much rather pay $15 for overall great earbuds instead of paying $85 more for a tad bit more clarity that I have to really try to hear the difference. It's honestly one of the few times I have bought something and as soon as useing it knowing I will always buy these. You caint go wrong. There good buld quilty. Aluminum frame the rubberised cord has extra thread support. They are super comfortable. IAM telling you if you want some great earbuds and you like bass but also like good sounding highs. But a few pairs of these. I want to try the $19 ones they have now. I am one of these people it takes me a month of doing research and looking at reviews before I buy something. Because you see reviews that are not the same and it can get overwhelming. But anyone reading this. Trust me if you listen to all kinds of music and you like bass but also like it to sound clear. These are great for music all music they really shine on rap and bass type songs. They are pretty good watching YouTube. There good for gaming when you just need a to go pair or back up.  But these are a steal for $15 .</span>

<span>Posted by the indivdidual recieving these earbuds as a gift from the purchasing party-<br/>T.L.;D.R. -<br/>These are great for $26. If you like bass heavy music, the wood makes them great for that. Cord coiling is a problem from time to time (trade-off for general durability, I would guess). Flat cabled earbuds are the only kind this isn't a problem with, in my experience.<br/>Great audio and good design for most uses.<br/><br/>Pros:<br/>- Great price for how they sound and feel (got them around 74% off of the list price, at 100% they would be on par with other models but still offer some good things). Heavy bass, good general audio for cross genre music or movie/show/video consumption.<br/>- 3.5mm cable input and sound driver housing (physical earbud) are both shaped to make it really easy use these whith phones, ipods, or any music device in a pocket or pouch.<br/>- Increadibly punchy base without losing sound performance from the mid and highs, apparently the wood material for these earbuds does something nice!<br/>- Good buit in microphone for the price, crisp sound without getting a ton of background noise from my loose testing with it.<br/><br/>Non-Pro/Cons:<br/>- Some sound bleed (this is necessary if you want the sound to be open and clean, but some people may not like this). The ports that are on the back of these are made to have some light sound bleed. If you need to listen to loud music in a quiet place, people around you will be able to recognize what you are listening to from time to time. It's a tradoff, either they don't leak sound and they muddle the audio, or they leak some and give a cleaner sound.<br/>- Not flush to the side of your head when in, so if you like to listen to music with bigger headphones on or when you are going to sleep, these will be poking into whatever is touching the side of your face.<br/><br/>Cons:<br/>- Cable can coil in on itself a bit. Just hanging around your neck it may twist into a loop from time to time. If you roll these up and throw them in your gym bag or pocket, they will probably have some of that coiling stay in them when you pull them out later.<br/>- Standard not-great silicon earbud tips, I would get some foam ones if you really want to make these comfortable for more than a few hours.<br/><br/>My father purchased these for christmas, and I had just asked for something "cheap." In the past I have had earbuds that were in the $100-$200 dollar range, but these seem to have a frequency response range that sounds better than those were able to produce with their escalated pricetags. These honestly sound better to my ear as 2 of the 3 more expensive earbuds that I have tried. The only better performing model in wired headphones being a pair of Bose earbuds that I was given 2nd hand years ago. For a price of $25.99 these are a steal, for $49.99 they are definitely competitive and worthwhile.<br/>At $100.00 these should be in the top few to choose from, at $26 if you want some spare earbuds you should try these. If you need some earbuds at $26 just get them.</span>

<span>Wanted to use these on my PC to listen to music but also for meetings, etc. The description reads as if there is a microphone and controls to answer calls, adjust volume/music tracks etc. but none of this is evident looking at them. I did get to listen to music a bit and the sounds quality was actually pretty decent for cheap earbuds. To be honest, I did not try the microphone feature as I had no need at the moment, so the tiny plastic bit on the wire could have been one. However, there were no controls anywhere on the device to answer calls, adjust music tracks, etc. Actually, nothing on the box indicated that there were any of these features so either the description on Amazon is inaccurate or they sent the wrong ones. Also, the wire itself is very stiff/inflexible and kept curling up and getting in the way which was exceptionally annoying and kept rubbing on the desk and my shirt so as to interfere with the sound - so I can imagine if there is a microphone this would be very distracting to whoever is on the other line. Would not recommend.</span>

<span>I was looking for new earbuds for my 16 year old son.  I was sick of disposable earbuds; I've thrown so many away that have bad cords.  So I searched on Amazon for earbuds with a nylon cord.  We had gotten a auxiliary cord a few years ago that was wrapped with braided nylon and it has proved to be much more durable than previous cords, hence the search for tougher earbuds.  We've had them for a few weeks so long term durability has yet to be determined but so far they are working great.<br/><br/>But on the plus side, I borrowed these from my son a few days ago to listen to a You Tube infomercial without disturbing my husband.  I was totally blown away!  I thought I was listening to stereo theater sound, surround sound, THX, Dolby Digital, whatever you call it.  I wonder what it would be like if I actually listened to music...  I read tons of reviews to decide to purchase these, and considering the crap earbuds we last bought from T*t for $18 that didn't even last a week, I consider this as $25 well spent.  My son has worn these with his Ipod while running and had no complaints that I know of.  If I have any further feedback, I will try to post a later update, especially on durability.<br/><br/>Personal rant, feel free to skip:  Unlike many reviewers, I DID NOT get these free or for any kind of discount.  Seriously, how do you get into that racket?  I would love to get free or cheap stuff but I have to say that I tend to not take those reviews very seriously, especially when they are all the first listed reviews.  I research pretty much everything I buy, both because I want value for my money, but also because I don't want to contribute any more than necessary to the landfills and the disposable mentality.  And I've been discouraged by the high number of products I've run across that look like they are buying their positive feedback.  Anyway, I feel I haven't done enough to post my own product evaluations, so cheers, here's to doing my part. :)<br/><br/>Update(12/08/2016):  the beloved earbuds have finally gone kaput after over two years of excellent service. If earbud years are like cat or dog years, that makes them about 150 years old.  The have had plenty of wear and tear and their final demise was due to the wood cracking...(possibly being stepped on, sat on, shut in a car door...(who knows with a teenager)  In any case, I am enthusiastically planning to buy another pair for each of my sons.</span>

<span>I purchased these headphones as a way to fully enjoy my music experience but I am in no way, shape, or form a profesional in this area. I urge you to keep that in mind as you scroll through my review. When I recieved this item I was disappointed in its appearance which isn't a big deal to some but to me it placed a factor in the purchase. The turquoise/teal cord is extremely vivid but alongside the cheap appearing silver sections of the headphones gave off a tacky vibe to me and those who commented on my headset agreed to it as well. The wooden bit does feel smooth and look beautiful but again I wish they paid more attention to the material in the silver linings because it made the whole earbuds look .. off. The storage bag included was a nice touch though. Be careful how you roll this item up however as they seem to conform to the shape and stay that way for a small period of time. These headphones are best enjoyed in a sedentary environment I learned that as I heard the cord scrape against my clothing while I ran or took a walk with my pet which I heard when my tunes were playing. A large annoyance. Allowing two coloured versions of the buds did add a small but reliable creative touch to these headphones. The sound I deemed to be subpar.  It didn't sound different from another pair of headphones that I bought for a much cheaper price from another brand/manufacturer, so I'm unsure about the premium factor and how it comes into play. Sound also leaked considerably because it would not form a seal properly no matter the nib size put on. It's very uncomfortable to wear with a hat on and when I formed a somewhat okay seal it would detach itself in a matter of seconds , or when I made a slight movement, leaving me to constantly adjust it. I gave up after my ears began to hurt from constantly changing the nibs,positions, and techniques in which I'd put them on. The little remote was plastic and aided in producing a tacky appearence. I did not own these longer than a week and have given them to my younger cousin who hasn't given me any sort of input at the moment. I added a star solely because customer service was superb in its quick response time frame and willingness to ship out a replacement pair if I encountered problems with the current one. The gal I spoke too was friendly as well and it made the chat much more enjoyable. I will update my review if I'm presented with any sort of malfunction /praise.</span>

<span>The Shure Aonic 3 Sound Isolating Earphones are the ground floor for the new Aonic series of earphones but don’t let that fool you. These are well made, upgradable, beautiful-sounding earphones and with a huge swath of included eartips, the Aonic 3’s are squarely in premium territory. The Aonic 3’s are notable for being Shure’s smallest earphone design, and with the MMCX connector system, you can swap the cable for either the Shure True Wireless Secure Fit Adapter or the </span>
<a class="a-link-normal" data-hook="product-link-linked" href="/High-Resolution-Bluetooth-5-0-Communication-Cable/dp/B07HYMWSGY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">High-Resolution Bluetooth 5.0 Communication Cable</a>
<span>. Despite all of the references to Bluetooth in the instructions, out of the box, this specific kit is 3.5mm wired only and can be configured to work with either iOS or Android phones with the flick of a switch on the in-line remote. These earphones have a sensitivity rating of 108 dB SPL @ 1mW and a modest 26Ω impedance which basically means your phone (and most other portable electronics) will be able to produce loud and clear sound without the need for a separate headphone amp.<br/><br/>My primary issue with the Aonic 3 is that it takes a lot of fiddling to put them in. The combination of the pill-shaped body and freely rotating MMCX connector results in an earphone without a clearly defined structure. If you look at the pictures, the earphone body is not really supported by anything other than the foam eartip in your ear canal and the cable, and the MMCX connector allows for free rotation, so although you can bend the over-ear hooks to your desired shape, nothing prevents the earphone body from getting out of alignment. Therefore, wearing the Aonic 3 becomes a two-step process where you first get the ear hook in place and then insert the earphone, and even after a few weeks of ownership, that process still requires conscious effort. The Aonic 4 and 5 use a more traditional shape that sits in the ear so they shouldn’t have this issue.<br/><br/>I was initially skeptical of the Aonic 3’s promise of providing striking full-range sound using a single balanced armature, but I was pleasantly surprised. From my experience, many single balanced armature earphones are able to render mids and highs with nuance and clarity, but the bass tends to be thin and relatively weak, especially when compared to even cheap dynamic earphones. With the Aonic 3, Shure used a vented design for the balanced armature which extends the bass response, and in my opinion, the results are surprisingly good. These earphones are pretty well-rounded, with clear and precise highs and mids that just aren’t possible from most dynamic earphones, and there’s enough oomph on the low-end to make most genres of music sound good, as long as they don’t lean too heavily on the bass.<br/><br/>It’s worth mentioning that Shure’s emphasis on sound isolation means that with proper eartips, these earphones are able to block outside sounds nearly as effectively as earplugs so you don’t need high volume levels to enjoy to your music, even when it’s noisy outside or you’re on the bus, etc. The caveat, of course, is that you need to pay extra attention if you’re walking around with these in your ears. If you’ve never used foam tips before, please note that they need time to fit themselves into your ear canal. You should compress them by rolling them with your fingertips before inserting, and then hold the earphone in place for about 5-10 seconds to let the foam expand.<br/><br/>Overall, I like how the Aonic 3’s sound but the process of wearing them is somewhat annoying. I’m not fully convinced that they’re really worth the full $199 MSRP, since at the same price, the Shure </span>

This is my first set of Shure earphones, so I will definitely be paying attention to their other product offerings down the road.<br/><br/>Notes:<br/>1) These have a 2-year warranty.<br/>2) Accessories in the box include a 1/4" adapter, soft flex sleeves (S,M,L), foam sleeves (comply-like) (S,M,L), yellow foam sleeves (one-size), triple flange sleeves (one-size), and a zippered carry case.</span>

These are tiny, but pack a punch.<br/><br/>Some of us still do like the sound quality, consistency and other benefits you just don't get with most Bluetooth sets. And yes these do include instructions for Bluetooth connectivity and they CAN be converted to Bluetooth with a (purchased separately) Shure wireless adaptor. This makes them a great value in my opinion because there are still many good applications for wired headphones.<br/><br/>But the rest of this review is about these as a standalone, wired set of headphones. They were chosen for use in a secure environment that doesn't permit Bluetooth. They stay snugly in place even while working out or on the job undertaking vigorous tasks. There is an entire bag of different buds (sleeves) to ensure these fit you properly. Just be sure you follow the instructions to get a good fit.<br/><br/>I do wish there was a cable allowing use with devices that don't have the 3.5mm jack, but there are dongles/adaptors for that. The raging about how these will become obselete is ill-founded because there are limitations to wireless.<br/><br/>I love the sound quality on this, especially listening to live recordings. Shure is a favorite with audiophiles for good reason. I am not the tech geek that can generate graphs and charts showing its performance, but I love my music and everything from classical opera to Duke Ellington to Jai Wolf to Led Zeppelin comes through my buds and it all sounds great.</span>

<span>These Shure earbuds are really nice earbuds. The sound quality that they produce is absolutely amazing really. The only one thing that I really don't like about these earbuds is that they fit in a really unusual way like to wrap around your ear. I have a really hard time getting these earbuds in my ears most of the time. When I do finally get them into my ear they are not very comfortable. I couldn't sit and wear these earbuds for more than an hour. I wish that there was an alternative way to wear these earbuds but to get them to fit in correctly at the same time. This is why I knocked one star off. I wish that they would just go in like regular earbuds. Other than that problem these earbuds are good quality and they have an amazing sound that is clear and crisp. If you really like the over or wrap around the ear style earbuds then these are probably for you.</span>

<span>I’ve known about Shure iems for about 15 years, and I’ve owned 2 pairs of the 215’s (the first pair were stolen). In the past, even the 215’s seems pretty spendy  to me, so I ever thought of trying out the higher models.<br/><br/>I was never totally stoked with the 215’s. I eventually ended up using the silicone earpieces because I used them to play drums and those earpieces isolated the sound the best. But I always felt that they were weak in the treble end.<br/><br/>I still use my headphones to play drums (or at least that’s why I bought these headphones), but now my kit is electric. I still need isolation, but not as much. Because I’m recording a lot, fidelity is very important. Reading other reviews, many noted that the 425’s had a much better high end than the 215’s. I also noticed that in the marketing blurbs Shure says that they made this model specifically for the purpose for which I wish to use it, so I put down my money.<br/><br/>Unfortunately the first model that arrived had a faulty cord. It was hard to tell at first, but when I turned my head the right side would cut out. I realized it was cord when I pulled off the cord from my 215’s and tried it on the 425’s, at which point they worked perfectly. So, got a replacement in a couple of days (thanks Amazon!) and second model has a good cord, I’m good to go.<br/><br/>Once again, I’m using these as IEM for playing my electric drum kit, so my review of their performance is based on how well they work for me in that application.<br/><br/>The difference between the two models (215, 425) is in my opinion dramatic. The high end and midrange is much better in the 425.  And it should be, with a whole additional driver to handle that spectrum.<br/><br/>In comparison with my Sony 7506’s, which is a good standard (or so I’ve heard) the sound stage feels wider. This means that my drums sound more uniquely situated and the stereo imagery is crisp and wide. It was almost disorienting at first, but I find it hard to live without once I got used to it. I very much prefer these to my 7506’s, which is what I was hoping for.  They are more comfortable, more isolating, and have a superior soundstage in nearly every way. I hear things with these clearly and prominently that I could barely make out in the 7506’s. I find that they have a full sound across the spectrum, so that my kick sounds full and deep, but my toms are easy to distinguish from my kick. The cymbals and high-hat are crisp and brightly warm, but not tinny.<br/><br/>I decided to go with the orange foam tips after trying all of them. I feel they sound the best and are very comfortable. I have no problem with them staying in my ears. After just a few minutes I will forget I’m wearing them, which can cause some cord issues...but still it’s a good problem.<br/><br/>In conclusion I’m very happy with these as in ear monitors for musical performance. They are not inexpensive, but I am not disappointed with what they deliver. If you can afford them, I highly recommend them.</span>

<span>I finally broke my Shure E3C earbuds after almost seven years of faithful service.  I crazy glued the stem back onto the earbud and the buds still work, but I felt nervous about the stem breaking again and getting stuck in my ear.  So I decided to get a new set and was wavering between the SE315's and the SE425's.  The 315's are probably close to the equivalent to what I was replacing, but the other reviews I read for the 425's praised their better bass response (deep, but clean), the wider range, and the superior noise isolation.  So I decided to spend the extra hundred dollars to upgrade to the 425's.  I am very happy that I did.  My old E3C's were great, and I would guess the SE315's would be equally good, but the 425's are a significant step up.  I have a wide taste in music but at least half the time I am listening to classical, so strong, clean bass, and a wide range to handle every orchestra instrument and the occasional classical vocal piece are essential.  I'm also in airplanes every week so sound isolation is important.<br/><br/>I might mention that in addition to my old E3C's I also have a set of Bose Quiet Comfort 15's, bought when I thought noise cancellation might be better than noise isolation.  I was wrong.  The Bose are great at killing jet engine noise, and are truly eye-watering in a turboprop, but they don't cancel out babies and rude adults.  The E3C's did a pretty good job of those problems, but the 425's are really amazing when it comes to sound isolation.  With no music playing, I can still hear conversations, but they are very muffled.  With music playing, even at fairly low levels, there is no ambient noise to intrude.  Somehow, Shure tweaked the angle of the earbuds so they get a perfect seal.  That being said, the 425's would be truly dangerous to wear while jogging or cycling.<br/><br/>So about the sound quality of the 425's.  Better than the E3C's; better than the Bose QC15's - but not quite at the audiophile level.  My guess is you need to spend considerably more to get something that will sound as good as a quality THX-certified home surround system.  On my home system, I can pick out exactly where a particular orchestra instrument is placed.  Can't do that with the 425's but the stereo separation is very good and gives you the full depth you would expect.  The quality of the 425's allow me to listen at lower volume levels, which is far less fatiguing (and quite a bit better for the ears!).  The quality of the bass presentation I noticed when I played my Boston Pops recording of  76 Trombones.  This piece has bass and kettle drums plus a tuba.  On my E3C's and the Bose QC15's all three instruments sound the same and kind of mush together.  On the 425's I can hear the difference between the drums and the tuba, and the sounds remain distinct.  If you've never used noise isolating earbuds before, it is absolutely critical to get a good seal in your ear - otherwise the bass will be very weak.  If you can clearly hear the conversations around you, you don't have a good seal.  Conversations should sound almost like you're under water if you have the earbuds inserted correctly.<br/><br/>A couple quibble points.  As other reviewers mention, getting the foam sleeves off that the 425's ship with is no small task.  Even using the trick of putting them in the freezer isn't a quick fix.  Knowing that the stems the sleeves fit on are fragile, it took me almost 15 minutes of gentle twisting and pulling to get the foam sleeves off.  Hey Shure, how about shipping the 425's without the sleeves installed?  The good news is, if you don't use foam sleeves, the other sleeves (soft rubber in three sizes, and yellow memory foam) are much easier to get on and off.  And once you find the right sleeve for you, you will never have to mess with that problem again.  The other quibble I have is the semi-rigid, 3" wire cover adjacent to the bud.  This wire should be bent to the curvature of the outside of your ear to help keep the bud securely installed.  It absolutely does that; there is no way these buds are going to fall out accidentally.  But the wire also makes the buds much harder to install in the first place.  Getting the buds inserted and secured is a two-hand task, and takes a while even once you think you have the hang of it.<br/><br/>If the quality of sound and excellent noise isolation are critical to you,and you don't plan to use them for jogging or cycling, and you can live with the quibbles I mentioned, these are the earbuds to buy!</span>

<span>I got these to listen to high-quality music with a snug-fitting wearing method. I don't produce music, but I do like to edit tracks here and then. Just to shed a little light into the kind of person reviewing this product.<br/><br/>============REVIEW================<br/><br/>I'll be splitting up the review in sections to make reading digestion easier. :P<br/><br/>---------THE FIT--------<br/>They fit very well. The over-the-ear method of wearing them provides the most amount of security from accidental tugs and movement. It did take some time to get used to how they hug the ear. The first long music-listening sessions made my ears hurt a little, but the pain subsided with prolonged use.<br/><br/>The 425's ability of noise-isolation is better than what I've used in the past. The use of memory foam tips for creating a seal works better than most other earbuds that use a silicon or rubber seal. Shure stresses for a good fit in the ear canal to provide the best sound and noise-isolation. When a good enough seal is created, it's good enough to take onto the gun range! Provided you use the correct sized memory foam tips and insert them properly however, but proper discretion is advised. :P<br/><br/>--------THE SOUND-------<br/>The sound is very true to the original recording. Other reviews were right in that Shure is more known for "bright" sounding products, products that focus on treble. With that in mind, the SE425s are no exception to that rule. I used to listen to a set of very "warm" sounding earbuds before listening to these, which caused the transition to the 425s very underwhelming. Warm-sounding products focus more on bass, and as a result, I was not used to a more neutral and flat-sounding product before these.<br/><br/>That fact actually made me consider returning them for a more warm-sounding set!<br/><br/>However, after using them for a while, I've grown accustomed to how they sound. The break-in did improve the quality of the sound in general, but it didn't improve the bass a whole lot. Determined to get these buds sounding the way I'm used to, I started tweaking my equalizer a bit.<br/><br/>First impressions after increasing the bass frequencies was phenomenal. I had to bump them up a fair bit, seeing how the 425's frequency response curve shows less bass response, but after the change, these buds respond to bass extremely well. The dual-driver nature provides for lots of bass with no distortion of the highs, and the balanced nature is able to yield clean-feeling bass with no muddied sound. Even ramping the bass up to unimaginable levels yielded no distortion whatsoever!<br/><br/>The fact that these are naturally neutral-sounding buds makes them perfect for music composition and editing. Equal representation of all sounds allows for unparalleled accuracy in composing, mixing, and editing tracks.<br/><br/>---------THE BUILD QUALITY----------<br/>I have yet to put them through anything that tests their limits of physical resistance to wear and tear, knowing that I put $238 out of pocket into these little investments...but with my daily use, I have yet to see any sign of damage. Granted that my use involves treating them like a newborn baby, but the 425s feel very solid and well built.<br/><br/>I love the fact that the parts are replaceable. Broken speaker? Speaker units are available for sale. Need a replacement bud tip? Shure has you covered. Snapped the cord? There's also something for that too. Each part is detachable for easy replacing of broken parts. No need to toss the entire thing and buy a new one.<br/><br/>What's more, is that the actual speaker unit is able to rotate separately from the wire! This allows for easy ear insertion and storage.<br/><br/>I believe the cord can also be upgraded by buying the cord with an inline microphone, or by buying the Bluetooth cord, and attaching the speaker units to those ones! I've read that the 425s can do that, but I haven't actually tried it.<br/><br/>&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;-OVERALL-&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;<br/><br/>Pros:<br/>+ Snug and secure fit<br/>+ Excellent noise-isolation<br/>+ Accurate and neutral sound<br/>+ Dual-driver clarity<br/>+ No distortion at high volumes<br/>+ Durable construction<br/>+ Easy replacement of broken parts<br/><br/>Cons:<br/>- Flat-sounding nature of buds might not be for everyone, especially those who like lots of bass<br/>- Insertion method might be a little tricky; definitely not fast on, fast off<br/>- Memory wire part of the cord causes entire thing to tangle more often</span>

<span>In short, these are the best IEM's I've ever tried, but I'm not 100% convinced that they're worth $300.<br/><br/>I'm not really an audiophile, but I did a lot of research on IEMs (earbuds that sit deep in the ear), and I thoroughly tested a few of my finalists. So, in this review I'm going to compare the Shure SE215's ($99), Shure SE425's ($299), and Etymotic Research ER-4PT's ($299). My main selection criteria were comfort, sound quality, and ability to block out outside noise (note that for this reason I first tried the Bose QuietComfort 20i's, but the active noise canceling pressure made my ears hurt).<br/><br/>SHORT SUMMARY: I easily recommend the SE215's in terms of price-performance; but, if you have more to spend then get the SE425's. The ER-4PT's are very crisp, but they have some significant physical downsides.<br/><br/>LONGER REVIEW:<br/><br/>First of all, I hear that it's important to choose headphones based on the kind of music that you listen to. So, for my tests, I used ten songs representing my favorite genres of EDM (house/trance), synthpop, and pop rock. Songs included Instant Crush (Daft Punk), Good Morning Kaia (BT), Crush (Dave Matthews Band), and A Sky Full of Stars (Coldplay).<br/><br/>Overall, the SE215's are excellent, especially for the price. When switching back and forth between them and the 425's, I could notice a clear difference, but not necessarily a $200 difference. If $200 isn't a huge deal to you, definitely get the 425's; but, I think you'd have to be a very discerning listener to really appreciate the increase in quality.<br/><br/>So what's better about them? Everything is clearer. After listening to the 425's, the 215's feel almost like a light blanket was thrown over the speaker -- everything is just a little muddier and the individual instruments are less clear. There's less separation between the layers. But again, this wasn't a dramatic difference, so you'd still be very safe with the 215's (and I understand that $300 is an insane amount of money for most people to spend on earbuds).<br/><br/>What about the ER-4PT's? They were even clearer, but almost clinically so. It felt a bit like I was in a perfectly empty room listening to every little nuance of the sound, but that sound was less warm than that of the Shures. To be honest, though, this difference was minimal -- in most cases, there wasn't a hugely noticeable difference between the ER-4PT's and the SE425's. I most preferred the Etymotics in songs involving crisp cymbals and complex background noises; but again, it wasn't a huge difference, and overall I slightly preferred the warmer bass of the Shures.<br/><br/>More importantly, I found two dealbreakers that meant I couldn't keep the Etymotics: (1) That crisp clarity of sound sadly translated to the wire as well; every time I moved my head I could powerfully feel/hear the wire moving, to the point that it was quite distracting. I believe that this is called microphonics. (2) The plastic piece connecting the wire going to each ear was surprisingly heavy, to the point that its weight very quickly became annoying compared to the other earbuds.<br/><br/>The other nice thing about the Shures is how easily they slip into your ears. Fair warning that it took me a while to figure out how to get them in right -- I was about to return them because it was so confusing at first, but I watched a youtube video and realized you have to actually significantly bend the rubbery part. Once you get the hang of it, it's extremely fast and easy to fit them in compared to the Etymotics that I really had to work in every time while holding my ear open with my other hand.<br/><br/>So, like I said, I recommend either one of the Shures depending on how much money you can spare on headphones. One other tip, by the way: Be very careful about trying all the different types of tips that are included. I noticed a dramatic difference when I finally found the right set that made a truly tight seal in my ear canal -- the bass became significantly stronger and the overall sound became tighter and cleaner.<br/><br/>Overall, I definitely recommend IEMs over regular earbuds (unless you're riding a bike or something that demands attention), but keep in mind that none of these will fully block out nearby voices on their own -- I needed to play white noise or music to achieve the true isolation I was looking for.<br/><br/>UPDATE AFTER ANOTHER WEEK:<br/><br/>After going back and forth some more between these and the 215's, I can safely say that the 425's are clearly better for anything but casual background listening. For certain songs especially, the 215's now sound like they're covered in a blanket when immediately compared to the 425's -- they're just much duller, muted, and bass-heavy. I'd still certainly recommend them for the price, but I've decided to spend a little more and keep the 425's.</span>
