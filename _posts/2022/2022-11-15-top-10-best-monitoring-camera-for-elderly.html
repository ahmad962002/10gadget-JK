<span>Updated Review<br/>----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>A criminal who had been released from jail on probation because COVID, robbed my garage 2 nights in a row.  I got a crisp and clear video, posted to the Ring app, other neighbors checked their video and found the same man on their property, the police were involved immediately and the perp was taken back to jail.<br/><br/>From the press release of our local PD:<br/><br/>"On 5/11/20, [city] Police Department Patrol responded to a residential burglary that occurred the night before. The victim had left their garage door open and went for a walk around the neighborhood. During that time, from about 8 pm to 8:30 pm, an unknown subject later identified as [nam,e] entered the garage, rummaged through the cars and stole the victim’s mountain bike. While [name] was in the garage, the victim’s family was at home in the house.<br/>...<br/>When the victim realized his bike had been stolen, he checked his Ring Camera video and saw that the suspect had been inside his garage. He posted the video onto the Ring Camera Neighborhood App, warning others in the area.<br/>Many community members had seen the video of the suspect and had been in contact with the [city] Police Street Crimes Unit (SCU). SCU and PROS (Post Release Offender Supervision) Detectives along with Patrol officers began looking for the suspect.<br/>...<br/>This was an excellent example of the community working together to put a criminal back into jail.<br/>...<br/>A review of the [city] Superior Court website shows that [name] has prior convictions for stealing a vehicle, robbery, using pepper spray to commit a violent felony, being under the influence of a controlled substance, possession of drug paraphernalia, and possession of narcotics. [name] is currently on PROS/AB109 and was in custody and had recently been released from jail on May 8th by Probation due to Covid-19 concerns."<br/><br/>For a $60 camera, this was a great investment.<br/><br/>Original Review<br/>----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>I had 5 of the Amazon Cloud Cams, purchased about 18 months ago.  Amazon then acquired Ring and Blink, and discontinued the Cloud Cams, although they still provide support (for now).<br/><br/>I needed two new cameras, so I went with the Ring.  Primarily because I heard nothing negative about the security, as opposed to Wyze.  However, Ring has some real downsides relative to the Amazon Cloud Cams.<br/><br/>1. More latency.<br/>I have great WiFi.  I have multiple wi-fi mesh routers throughout the house with no dead spots.  Still have to wait ~5-7 seconds to connect to live view.  Cloud Cams was 3-5 seconds.<br/>2. No zoom<br/>I could tap and zoom on Cloud Cams.  Can't do that with Ring.<br/>3. No live view via Web Browser.<br/>Apparently you can download an app on Windows 10, but I'm on a Mac and wonder why I can't view the video in a browser.  I could go with Cloud Cams.<br/>4. I can't see multiple Cameras at once.<br/>With Cloud Cam, I could stream audio and video from all five cameras at once over the web.  It was great. Having to switch between cameras, one at a time, and having to wait 5-7 seconds per camera, is a big downside.<br/><br/>I get that Amazon needed to simplify its product portfolio after their two most recent acquisitions in this space, but it's a shame the Cloud Cam isn't sold anymore.  It was a superior product offering in this space.<br/><br/>Design, Packaging, Ease of Setup, and from what I can understand, Security is all excellent in Ring, and I have no complaints.  The app, in spite of the one camera at a time limitation, is well-designed too.<br/><br/>*** UPDATED 3-Jan-2020 ***<br/>I found the Rapid Ring app.  It works in conjunction with the regular Ring app.  Rapid Ring has limited functionality, but it does everything I need.  Somehow, it manages to reduce latency to connect to the cameras.  When I pull up the Rapid Ring app, I can connect to anyone of my cameras in &lt;1 second.  The app will also continuously reconnect to the camera after the 5 minute timeout period, so I can stream a camera indefinitely.  I have upgraded my review to 4 stars.  If Ring ever develops a generic web interface to view all cameras simultaneously, I will give 5 stars.</span>

<span>Bought this to monitor my pups when I’m out of the house and it does the job for which I bought it for.  Motion, clarity, alerts are on track.  I can view my pups when I’m out, listen to them, and able to speak to them if I need them to behave.  Great purchase for the price.👍🏻</span>

<span>I love this camera. I purchased only one just to see if it would do what I wanted it to do - AND IT HAS! It has great panoramic view once you review a recording, and wonderful motion view as it's recording. I will definitely be purchasing additional cameras! Highly recommend.</span>

<span>I own 5 Ring indoor cams, along with a Ring Elite doorbell and a stick up elite POE cam.  This is just my input regarding these cams as I have been testing them and using them for quite sometime.  First thing is not every indoor cam works the same, some arrive with older firmware and need updating.  Plug in close to your router and do the full set up and do your updates.  Once you add the cam to the app and it’s working well, unplug it and move it to the area you want to monitor.  Do your set up either by mounting it or setting it on a shelf.  Get the angle of view your looking for and then set up your motion zone and sensitivity.  Make sure you check the “health” box to see your signal sensitivity.  If you are using a mesh router network, you should reconnect to the closest link for it, if not you may have to reconfigure to the nearest of it isn’t automatic.  Make sure you turn on the snapshot option as well.  If you don’t want to have the indoor cams record or send alerts while your home, you can turn that ability on and off with the new quick access buttons in the app.  You will get 30 days of free recording for ALL your cams, with each cam you buy. So if you decide to buy one a month, till you cover all your angles in the home, you will literally get an additional 30 days for every cam on your network covering the 50 days of cloud storage for free.  Why not use this option while it’s still available.  After you cover your needs, opt for the yearly service.  I have 5 indoors cams, covering almost 4000 sf.  I love that I can drop in and watch over the home as well as hear and talk through the cams.  Night vision in a room is great too. Makes a great baby cam as well.  I have had 2 indoor cams give me problems in the past, either dropping off my network, or the snapshot option not working.  If you have read my ring reviews before, I am well versed in networking and I have found that some ring reps want to always point the finger at every else but their devices.  I can say I have found problems in a couple of their devices and once they were replaced, the problem was solved.  Don’t allow them to drive you insane, the community forums are good but they only can go so far for help as well.  Sometimes a quick swap of the unit with a new one solves the problem.  Amazon has always backed me and they are truly behind their customers.<br/><br/>4/2020:  I wanted to be able to watch the main entrance and hallway in my home, have an eye level view, no wires at all showing, and nothing that stood out of place.  So review the attached pics, maybe this install will gravitate people who are inclined to custom installs, know there is no limit to what you can do.  Just plan out your work and never rush.  I was able to recess an indoor cam into my wall, and still provide me with all the aforementioned needs.  I used a double electrical box as it provided me the necessary room without modifying the box.  I used an indoor/outdoor ring power supply and reused the indoor cam plug on the power supply as it fits perfect and locks in.  I obtained 120v power from a nearby electrical outlet, and brought my wire into the box from behind the wall.  I mounted the ring power supply on the back of the electrical box, and prepped the box to accept the camera.  I created a clear acrylic template and was able to use that to cut out the blank wall plate.  What’s really nice is I can still unscrew the wall plate and easily remove the cam if I need to do a reset or adjustment.  This solved many issues for me and still provided an eye level video shot of persons entering the front door.  Since the ceilings are 12’ high, mounting the cam at the ceiling with a downward angle wasn’t conducive in getting a good facial shot.  This is just one example of several I have designed myself to combat issues most of us have dealing with wires, angles, placement, etc.<br/><br/>11.21.20:  After almost a year of Ring use, I have to say I am disappointed in the Ring community forum, their tech support, and products.  Just recently, I had two of the ID cams drop offline.  No matter what I did, no luck getting them back to work.  I actually unplugged a back up ID can and went to move it, that one also dropped offline and never came back up.  Tech support was of no help, and the community forum mod just tells you to call in.<br/><br/>I would think using 10 ring cameras, I know a little about them.  Based on my research, they connect to WiFi, but can’t get to the internet.  It appears that there is a high probability that my ISP is blocking the camera for possible threats, even though I turned off my firewall, set up a DMZ zone, and just about created a WiFi bridge to push the Ring cameras too, they still won’t work.  They don’t play nice since the last firmware update.  So as they fail, I am replacing them with another company.  Honestly, I don’t care what brand I use, as long as it works.  Read the community forums, and see for yourself.  Setting up cameras is not really that difficult, troubleshooting isn’t either as long as you have full control of all devices.  Ring doesn’t allow for device control outside of normal settings.  Also, Ring devices CAN NOT, be wiped clear of stored memory setting for your home network.  It’s embedded in the device.  Even if you remove it from your home network, and sell it.  It still has your network mirrored in its memory.  Found this by pure chance.  At the very lease you should have the cams IP address to clear out stored info and reset it.  Wow</span>

<span>This a review about the outstanding customer service from Wansview. I did purchase this camera a couple of years ago and I'm totally satisfied with the purchase. This is about an older model that I got from my daughter, the Q3S indoor camera. I couldn't get it to pair with the app so I contacted Wansview thru email at their site. Next day the communication started. The detailed but easy to understand steps to fix the situation was very impressive. I ended up sending them a photo of the label on the bottom of the camera, next day they sent me the fix. Older camera needed an older app. The app I was using was for this camera above which is newer and uses the cloud camera app. They sent me the link and I downloaded the older app and bingo! the camera was online like it was new. This kind of C.S. is what we should expect from any company. Two thumbs up  to Jessie and Monica at Wansview who help me solve this problem, thanks again .</span>

<span>The camera is most impressive with its day and night resolution This is my first Wansview camera and we love it. We tried many brands and for the resolution this little camera is very competitive with the big brand names. We use this camera in our living room for our cats and it serves it purpose. We wish it had more of range of motion so we can really see where the cats go when we’re not home. Overall it’s a great camera and I recommend this to all home owners and business owners that are looking for a camera that will amaze you and won’t break the bank with its low cost.</span>

<span>This is great camera for those locations where you need active monitoring.  I carry a couple with me as I travel to use at a location doesn't need a full blown camera security system, but just a way to remotely monitor an area or employees.  For that these cameras are great.  Setup can be done in about 5 minutes, and the ability to remotely move the field of vision is a great feature on such an inexpensive web camera.  Picture quality is also great, and the night vision works well too.  I which the desktop software worked better and was easier to use, as I would rather store my video locally than in the cloud.  Overall though if you need a quick and cheap monitoring solution, this is it.</span>

<span>I'm no security camera expert so take my review as you wish lol<br/>This is the first camera I've bought for security purposes indoor. The quality of the video and sound is good. I liked how the camera could move around and the real-time kept up with the app when watching from the video feed.<br/><br/>The app itself crashed 50/50 when used. I wasn't a big fan. The layout of it was decent, so it was pretty user friendly, I just felt like it was a bit unreliable.<br/><br/>I'd say if you are looking for something to casually keep an eye on an area this is a good cheap buy but if you want something more reliable, look elsewhere.</span>

<span>I'm just shaking my head in disbelief by Wyze's haggling, aggressive and deceitful marketing, and greedy sales strategy.<br/><br/>In short, you're paying twice the price over a v3 camera and you're getting MUCH less for your money with this new v3 Pro camera.<br/><br/>So far, I've purchased two original v1 cameras, two v2, two v3, three of those light bulb socket USB power adapter thingies, and now, regretfully, a v3 Pro.<br/><br/>Throughout the years, I've seen Wyze slowly and gradually remove completely free and somewhat revolutionary features from their products. These features were in fact, the reason why I bought their products in the first place.<br/><br/>With the new v3 Pro there's no free 12 second clip recordings, no more RTSP, and the list goes on. It's all going away! You want those features? Cough up a monthly subscription, pal!<br/><br/>As other mentioned, the 2K resolution is barely an improvement over the 1080p from the v3.<br/><br/>The one and only reason why I bought this is new camera was because it comes with a built-in motion activated light. But the shortcomings are too great. The price is also just about twice that of the regular v3 camera. It's just not worth it. It takes a long time to get the video streaming going. It's a mess.<br/><br/>I'm definitely returning this half-baked product, crippled by pure greed. That's right, their greed clearly got in the way of common sense this time around.<br/><br/>Dear Wyze-a$$ corporation and founders (Yun Zhang, Dave Crosby and Dongsheng Song): If you're expecting a monthly paid subscription from me, after butchering the release of your most revolutionary camera yet, so badly like this, not only you're not going to have it, now you've lost yourselves a loyal customer altogether, that could be purchasing your new hardware today and in the future. I'm not paying for a subscription. Ever.<br/><br/>I'm done with Wyze products moving forward.</span>

<span>I bought these cameras in 12/2021 and it has taken a few months of experimenting with the different settings and positions in 4 of my windows and viewing angle placements on four entry points of the sides of my house. Not good for above ground level apartments or 2nd story dwellings. I wish the cameras had the ability to tilt and pan, at least a little, I still have some blind spots but major views of most important places. They are very sensitive to motion detection so there are constant motion detections it picks up and records even though I have it set only for "person detection" only and works well with the only have 2 bars of the signal strength.<br/>Often light reflecting off the window and from outside car lights passing by will set off a "person detected" warning. The Set Detection option works only for up close views in the front vs. the background areas, so using that will blot out what the camera catches up front as well. Even on the very low setting, the cameras pick up windy branches moving, dripping rain drops, birds and of course critters for motion detected.<br/>Picture quality is amazing, clear and detailed, even at night. I can see up the street and beyond depending on the daylight hours, and if I zoom in up close, although the clarity diminishes more than 50 feet away. The clear views at night are enhanced with a separate motion detector already installed.  Wary of battery replacement, I love the electrical power cord option and the SD storage disk, having no subscription. I used an extension cord where needed. I love the different options in the app for recording and formatting which I have to do daily because there are so many motion detections. However, I've learned how to speed through "Rapid Playback" viewing the videos on the fast forward button and having it set to record when motion is first detected. It's become easy to locate actual motions in the alerts to view and the various select and delete options. I love how the videos can be viewed in time blocks or singular views. I love being able to download to my iPad for larger screen viewing or to keep. I have not used the permanent attachment strips to hold the cameras in the windows yet because I open two of the windows outward in warm weather. It's a good idea to remove and replace the camera ever so often as directed and you get reminders to do this in the app. Also, the sticky pad has detached from the face of one of the cameras and I will have to replace the suction cup eventually or apply the camera with the permanent strips. Not sure how long the suction cups last. The camera detached from the window. If your window gets a lot of sun, the camera can heat up from the constant running. The camera is set to record when movement is detected, I may have to play with this feature setting some more. There are a few seconds at the start of viewing a recording where the white task bar is up and blocks the view and I wish I could delay or turn it off, even though it slides down out of place, you loose a few seconds at the very start of video viewing. I still like these cameras and am learning the various features in the app. Because these cameras work pretty well, I wish Panasonic/HomeHawk would improve their Indoor Floor camera (sound issue, lighting issue) for indoors and make a similar quality. I like the ability to control lighting from a distance. Also make a better more compact, two-way sound, with siren wired or wireless, microSD card, outdoor camera also to be used with their app. The one that they have is large and bulky, has motion detector light built in and I already have that, it is also reachable for tampering with.<br/>I recommend these cameras for single level homes with ground level windows and door windows. They cost a bit more. No subscription needed, storage slot up to 240 GB, time stamp, LED status control, works on your network, works away from home (not sure out of state, will see), gives warnings on the phone within seconds in the app, overwrite recording option and other settings I am still reviewing.</span>

<span>I wasn't sure this was going to work through our screens on the windows but it does works great. There are two issues and it might be how we have it set up. First, it disconnects from our network once in a while for some reason and hard to get it to reconnect. Should not do this based on where our camera is to our router; secondly, it doesn't always pick up a person. We had someone come to our door, drop a package off and the notice that motion was detected did not happen until they were walking away.  These are very small issues  to us since we really love this camera that we now have purchased 3 of them for around the house.</span>

<span>I love it!!!!  I put the camera on our garage door window, using the blue wide masking tape, a extension cord and some hooks that the camera stays on the window and the cord won't touch on anything when garage door opens.  It works out great looking over our driveway.  I wish I could angle down a little bit, but I still like the fact that the camera is securely installed inside of the window, I don't need to worry about the battery, and on the top of it, there is no monthly fees (WooHooooo!!!)!!<br/><br/>Like many reviewers say, the app could have some improvements probably because I'm used to Ring app. (I have a Ring Doorbell Pro.)  I wish I could delete the video clips in the "recording list" by swiping it out (or check multiple photos to delete them all at once).  Setting up the camera in the app is a bit confusing.  First, you need to turn on your location on your device. Then I suggest you to be near router when you connect your camera to your wifi, then the camera to your device following the in-app step-by-step installation guide.  After you finished setting up the connections, then you can simply unplug the camera and take it to wherever you want to install it.  Once wifi is all connected, you can easily plug/unplug the camera from the power outlet and no need to set up the wifi again and again like Ring Doorbell cameras which is very frustrating.<br/>(UPDATES: I found a quick delete selection in the app! "Show All"&gt;"Select".  And I started to like this app as I'm getting used to it!  I lower the sensitivity on my motion detection, but there are still a lot of videos recorded.  What I like about this app is that I can chose "Person Only" recordings to review the recordings.  That way, I don't have to waste my time looking for the ones that shows some human activities in my property.  Another option that I like is that I can easily protect some of the video clips with one click. I used to use Ring app.  That's why it took for me to get used to the Homwhawk app.  But now I actually like this app better than Ting app.  It's well coordinated once you get used to it. )<br/><br/>It takes some delay to watch the live view, but I personally think it's slightly faster than Ring. (It depends on my wifi strength too.) But it doesn't really matter to me since I don't have to "answer" to the camera activities.  If there is any action going on, then the camera is already recording the activities anyway.  So I won't worry about the little delay so much.<br/><br/>My garage windows are all tinted dark.  But the picture quality is excellent even at night!  We have a street light 2 houses away across the street which seems to give enough lighting for our camera to be able to pick up the images in color! (I don't even have the highest quality setting.)  I also lower the motion sensitivity but it catches all of the activities in the area I chose.<br/><br/>There is no microphone on this camera.  So the noises won't trigger the recordings. Your privacy inside of your house is protected.<br/><br/>I purchased 128GB of micro SD card for the camera as Amazon suggested, and it's working just fine although I later noticed that the camera is supposed to take up to 64GB of micro SD card as some reviewers stated.<br/><br/>I can choose if I want to turn the LED light (which is located on back of the camera) on/off in the app, and there is no light shown in front of it.<br/><br/>My daughter also downloaded the app to check her car on the driveway.  It seems like up to 4 devices can be connected to this camera at once.<br/><br/>Overall, I'm so happy with the purchase!  I don't have to worry about my neighbor getting on to our camera when I'm setting it up as they have no idea when we are setting it up.  (My neighbor who also has the Ring doorbell has sneakily gotten on to our camera once (this really happened) when I had hard time setting up our Ring Doorbell Pro for the first time. Now I know why I had a hard time connecting it because they were stealing our Ring signal before we were trying to connect with it. Creep!)  Even we get power outage, this camera would just reconnect the wifi itself when the power is back.  You can relocate this camera anywhere you want in your house.  You don't need to recharge the battery.  It's Panasonic.  They are good and I trust many of their products!<br/><br/>Lastly, I'd like to request to Panasonic to make more products like the doorbell cameras, the outdoor motion detection driveway/front porch alarms (with no camera--to be less expensive), and less expensive window cameras, outdoor gate camera (like a peeping hole camera with weather proof) which all come with wired or wireless.  I would definitely buy more Panasonic products to protect all around my property!<br/><br/>Anyways, I'm really happy with the purchase, and HIGHLY recommend it.  It's impressive!!</span>

<span>Getting the camera to connect to the WiFi took some experimentation. If you have a 2.4/5 GHz router you must use only the 2.4GHz band. To do this I finally connected to the camera with Ethernet directly to the router and manually selected the 2.4GHz channel and then entered the WiFi password for the router manually. The audio based communication to enable wireless via the smart phone to the camera didn't work, I believe due my router defaulting to 5GHz, which they do tell you in the instructions won't work so definitely read the instructions.. The pan/tilt/zoom functions are as expected and even though it's digital zoom it works nicely for me in my application to watch the dog while we're out.  The mic and speaker provide intelligible speech both ways. Once wireless was enabled I was able to take the camera to anywhere in the house and use it. I might get another one to do additional surveillance. The app (I have Android) was easy to install, had no hiccups along the way and functions very intuitively. BTW I am writing this review on the day I did the install so it's still pretty fresh in my mind.  If you write a review they'll send you 16GB micro SD card which just pops into the back base section of the camera.  The mounting 'stand' was essential for how I mounted it and I thought it was well engineered as it works in either vertical or horizontal orientations. They also provide an Ethernet cable so you don't have to go scrounging for one. I would have given 5 stars across the board if the camera worked on both bands and also the speaker audio while perfectly intelligible sounds a little tinny which I guess is to be expected given the small size of the thing.</span>

<span>I thought I loved these cameras.  I have two of the older model with lower resolution and they connect quickly and reliably and provide excellent picture quality.  Unfortunately I bought two more and they are terrible.  At first I thought I needed a firmware/software update but even after that, they take a long time to connect and sometimes they don’t connect at all.  Getting service from the company is torture.  It’s hard to find an email to them and when I finally did they told me to update the firmware.  When I did and told them the problem still wasn’t fixed, they just stopped responding.  I guess I would call this a lesson learned.  Mind you, when they do work they are great.  But if you get one that doesn’t work right immediately, return it for a refund before the return window closes or you’ll be stuck.</span>

<span>I love the image from these cameras. Now, you're definitely not getting Arri or red cinema camera quality. These are meant to be security cameras, and to be honest, the night vision and normal footage from these cameras are great. Two major issues for me that kill the benefits though.<br/><br/>Many times I attempted to record something, and it seems it is recording, yet later I find out nothing records. Turns out, the micro SD cards will not work for me. No matter what card I try and how many times I format outside and (successfully) inside the camera. The cards do not work, and you don't really know until you record and later find out nothing is there. Thats absolutely horrible!<br/><br/>The second thing is the field of view. An individual must be quite center or far out of the frame before they are in the field of view of this camera. When I purchased these, one thing on the comparison charts was the field of view. I paid no attention to it, because why would a security camer need me to be directly in the center of it, or at least 7-8 feet away from the camera until it picks me up? That makes no sense.<br/><br/>Another side note, I purchased the Kami mini camera option which is titled (face detection). Turns out the other model has firmware hacks which allow you to record to RTSP streams but this model doesnt. The Yi models can (by hacking them) allow you to stream a live feed to something like facebook or youtube. This would be great to have as you can then just constantly stream to a private RTSP stream on your own facebook or youtube and have a backup without worrying about memory cards or subscription services. Unfortunately, the model I purchased doesn't have this option.<br/><br/>If it is possible to change the field of view, or anyone knows the trick to the sd cards working, please let me know.</span>

<span>I have had to spend way to much time learning how to navigate the unit, it's functions etc.  hours and hours, just because the user manual does not address how to use the functions.  I am wireless using a wireless hot spot because they don't Dish Cable doesn't have internet out where I live.  I still have not figured out how to set the sensitivity for when it hears something it takes a picture.  One morning I woke up with over two hundred pictures on it and the house was quiet all night, and then you have to delete them one at a time I guess.  The pan function of the camera hangs up quite often also.  I purchased a 32gb sd and that's where I will store my data. Picture is good on 720, the night camera is not that good, I leave a light on in the living room on low and that helps.  Don't like the red motion detector light flashing every 3 seconds or so, makes it to easy for someone getting into your house to spot it,  should be a way to turn that off.  Still trying to figure things out after playing with it 2 weeks.  Installation was about an hour until it was working, not bad.  I guess it serves its purpose, wife said she cant hear me talking to her when I am on line and away from home, so the intercom is not that hot.  Maybe its just my unit.  Overall it works, and the price cant be beat.</span>

<span>Overall:  Excellent Camera<br/><br/>Pros:<br/>Unlike some other cameras, the instructions for this camera can actually be understood<br/>Good quality picture<br/>Videos where motion was detected have red icon in the upper left corner and red spots on the scrubber bar making it easy to find out what happened<br/>Admin functions are easy to use<br/>Can view recordings without pulling the card<br/><br/>Cons:<br/>Ear splitting tone for configuring Wi-Fi.  When you are configuring the Wi-Fi, the smartphone app plays an ear splitting sound.  You are to hold your Smartphone speaker up to the mic (on the left side of the unit as you are facing it) until it starts the connection process.  It reminds me of the old dial-up modem connection tones, but 1,000 times worse.<br/>This is the ONLY con I have found so far and in no way affect the star rating.<br/><br/>Setup was very easy.  Make sure that you have a QR Barcode  scanner on your phone prior to beginning the setup process.  First, you will scan a QR code to get the SereneViewer App.  From there, just follow the instructions and the camera will set up very quickly.  However, you might want to have some ear plugs handy prior to starting the Wi-Fi configuration process as the sound is ear splitting.<br/><br/>After you have the camera set up, you can begin to tweak the admin settings, such as motion detection, recording, etc.  The instruction manual lists a website you can also go to for access to your camera and the very same admin type functions.<br/><br/>After it has been running for a bit and recording, accessing those recordings could not be more straight forward.  Any recordings where motion was detected will show a red icon in the upper left corner of the thumbnail. Then, when you launch the video, the scrubber bar has red marks where the actual motion was detected.  It is such a great piece of functionality.  I have attached a few images to this review to show the red icon and red marks on the scrubber bar.<br/><br/>I am thoroughly impressed with this camera.</span>

<span>I used this to watch my dogs while I was on vacation. It was set properly to scan back and forth in the living room area but stopped moving all the way to one side. And when I tried to talk to whoever was there, they couldn’t understand very well. But, it was inexpensive and did what I needed it to do for the most part.</span>

<span>For the price, I wasn't sure what to expect.  But this camera will allow me to keep an eye on my office during nights and weekends, especially with the increase in break-ins in my area.<br/>The down side is that the micro SD card goes into the camera for automatic recording upon motion detection.  So if there's a break in, the thieves only needs to steal the camera and all record of them is gone.  There is an option for cloud storage as an alternative, though - for a fee.<br/><br/>Since I'm mostly checking in during the night, I'm impressed with the night vision.  I can easily tell if someone is in my office when they shouldn't be.</span>

<span>I purchased this product Not only to keep an eye on my personal belongings but also as a deterrent for potential thievery.  I just moved into a Living  arrangement with a roommate and while I kind of trust him, he does allow some who are HIS friends to remain in the apt while he’s away. Not cool. So, as he refuses to inform me of this and for my own piece of mind, I purchased  this device.<br/>I’m giving this a 3-3.5 out of 5 stars here why: POWER source- it needs to remain plugged in at all times and has no alternative power source (ie. batteries). If the power goes out, the camera is ineffective.; WIFI Connection REQUIRED- At all times for this device to work. If you’re like me then you’re rarely home and have no need to pay for internet service when you can connect all devices using your phones hotspot. I now pay for internet service just to have security but don’t love doing so. Having said that, if the power is interrupted only briefly or if the device loses internet connection for some other reason, you would need to be there to reconnect. This is why I took more points away.  But if you can manage to keep this device powered and connected, it is a neat security device. The night vision isn’t the best quality but it gets the job done. Equipped with motion detection this camera also begins to capture And record a video clip once movement is detected. An alert is sent immediately and footage is available so i can see what’s happening in real time  The picture quality is pretty good, and there’s a two way microphone so your voice is heard loud and clear when  addressing any intruder. Good product but because there’s no alternative/backup power source<br/>Which means there’s a greater chance for malfunction and thus less confidence and piece of mind AND a WiFi network is REQUIRED for the device to do any part its job, I have to give this product 3.5 out of 5.</span>

<span>This device is worse than awful. It took 6 attempts to set up, the instructions are absolute garbage, poorly written and grammatically incorrect. There was no apparent way to disable the alarm from motion tracking, there was no apparent way to simply set up a recording and walk away, recording stopped when you turned off the screen for the device that you connected the camera to, there is no way to fully verify the resolution other than setting the mode to "FHD" which, yes, should mean Full HD, but with this devices track record so far, who knows. Attempting to remove the SD card is a nightmare in itself, the motion tracking went haywire when all i did was move my hand up and down.....and lastly, and perhaps the most troubling, were the permissions the app asked for...one of which was to "make and receive phone calls"....FOR WHAT???!!! NO!...and also, my phone began behaving badly after the app was installed...i could no longer bring up running apps (by hitting the square button...android) so close the app which was required for the numerous times i had to restart set up.....<br/><br/>this is literally a pathetic excuse for an electronic device....i am ashamed to have even purchased it....I am a technical guy, but after this, i feel like i know NOTHING. Do not waste your time...find another device and hope you don't have the same issues I did with this one.  just awful, awful, awful</span>

<span>I just finished installing this camera in my home.  The install was a little vague and required first scanning a barcode which installed software on my iPhone.  I would have preferred to be given the name of the app to install myself as I don't like anything that instantly installs itself.  Then you have to scan a code on the bottom of the camera, and finally the camera scans a code on your phone.  I had trouble on this step until I realized that they had put a protective seal over the camera lens (likely to protect it from scratching).  Once I removed that the phone and the camera communicated and it was set up and ready to use.  I haven't used any advance features such as motion detection - again the documentation is pretty poor, and what is shown on their website in terms of menus in the software, etc... don't always corresponds.</span>
