<span>I finally got it working.  My wifi is fine, so I suspected the phone advice might be wrong.  I loved how easy it was to get someone on the phone, who was kind patient and very helpful getting me back on line, however briefly.  But wifi was not the problem she expected.  Actually I just rewired same position of camera to different, closer plug, AND I ATTACHED THE ANTENNA.  I am not sure which worked, but it has not fallen offline since.  Motion detector is extremely inconsistent.  At night, the lights in the actual camera flare, or something, and motion detector goes on ALL NIGHT.  Every bug, every breath of wind, every flash of headlight of a car passing, even out of range, will create an event.  BUT WHEN MY TENANT ARRIVES AND LEAVES THE DRIVEWAY fully into and out of range of camera, THE MOTION DETECTOR DOES NOT ACTIVATE.  There is no rhyme or reason to this, as it may have been windless with no events, and SUDDENLY THE CAR IS BACK, or is gone, and no event of this!!!!  No rhyme or reason.  I am so relieved to have saved the expense of the wifi booster, because I realize the only way I can have an accurate available account is with the CLOUD SERVICE.  I run an AirBnB, and this January a malicious tenant actually popped my tires.  700 bux.<br/> Although I didn't see him, there is no doubt in my mind, as this is a crimefree street, where I have lived safely for 20 years.  I had no proof, no recourse and so installed the camera, as I suspect he will be back in the area next season, and may do the same.  My other problem is that the heavy demands on my phone seems to be breaking it.  My brand new economy Samsung Galaxy phone is getting weaker and weaker since the camera started working.  First the sound went, and now it nearly holds no charge, and the sound is almost completely gone.  I will have to purchase a new phone, will have to purchase cloud coverage to capture all the motion that the camera does not send to my events.  I will need to install a second camera to other side of home in the hopes that the two together will truly cover and capture any criminal activity on the property, as the night vision is blurry and the motion detector more confused than during the day.  Although during the day, camera  ALSO DOES NOT MOTION DETECT WHEN CAR PULLS INTO DRIVEWAY!!!!!!!  It is positioned on the soffitt at the eave, sees whole driveway, and stays dry and safe.  I am mystified that the smallest visible slice of wheels going by on the street will activate an event, but the whole car pulling slowly into the driveway will not!!!  AND REMARKABLY ALTHOUGH IT CATCHES SLICES OF THE WHEELS OF EVERY CAR PASSING BY, IT DOES NOT MOTION DETECT THE SLOW POST OFFICE VEHICLE!!!! which would be a great aid to me, when out, as much of my other business works by mail.  It occasionally captures me walking in range, cleaning leaves etc, but mostly not.  Is the motion detector activated by fast speeds?  No that isn't it because it captures the wheels of the neighbors car, at the very edge of the range, every time he SLOWLY pulls in and out of his driveway next door, it just will not capture the MAIN CAR PULLING IN AND OUT&lt; directly in range!!  I will keep adjusting it.  Maybe it works better with motions at the very edge of its range?  Just can't understand it.  But when I  actually can have the phone off the charger, for fewer and fewer minutes per day, it is a great delight to see the driveway and the property, see the stray cats, without needing to peek put the windows.  etc.  Love the whole idea, just wish the motion detector worked consistently.  Motion detection thing does not make sense!  Next camera will be further from driveway, but must angle it between trees.  Hope the two together will help me capture the creepy scary guy if he comes back.  Unfortunately I am too broke to get a bigger more qualified phone, or the second camera, or the cloud service.  I will probably have one phone for calls and one for the cameras. Hopefully in time!</span>

<span>I have been using these for a couple months now and would like to inform potential buyers that the videos are marginally available.  I have experimented in different ways to see how often motion is sensed, video is available, image quality and overall reliability. I have a strong background in technology but am not a representative of any company or being paid to evaluate these products. I purchased these for my private use to improve my home security.<br/><br/>I purchased these after 2 incidents where someone was coming to my front door at odd hours, which alerted the dog, and finding a suspicious person at the front door.  Asked them what they wanted and in response: "I have the wrong house, I was looking for a friend".  The local community web page noted the same description of this person.  Thank the dog for alerting us.<br/><br/>I try to access these cameras from my home computer using the web site they provide.  I also installed the mobile app on Android mobile phone.  It is possible to view the same video from more than one device, simultaneously.  I have a very strong and reliable internet connection.  However, I frequently have problems accessing the camera videos.  Sometimes the site says Camera not available, sometimes it is just a black screen (see image).  One of the cameras is in the same room as the wifi router. I have not determined if the camera is the problem or the service of Zmodo and server.  I tried to unplug and plug in the camera when it was unavailable, which appeared to work, but again just waiting for it start working again which it did.  Sometimes it is just one cameras while the other is working fine, sometimes it is the other way around and sometimes neither is showing. My guess is the Zmodo server.  I need to add an evaluation step to ensure I can ping the zmodo server while the camera is inactive.<br/><br/>Initial motion sensing: When I first started using this camera, it picked up some brush motions when the wind blew.  You can use the mobile app to adjust the motion sense area, but this is not available on the web site.  Motion sensing produced 5 image clips that automatically steps through them, which is neat.  However, I would prefer video during all motion sensing because we do not get additional images after the first 5 so there is no telling what happens after that time.  The camera that is on the second floor (image) gets some notifications but the object has to be right of the camera frame though the area should pick up closer objects.  The front door sometimes catches images (cars) in the street too.<br/><br/>Issue with Microphone: I check the setting each day and notice the Microphone is often turned on.  I keep turning it off.  I do not want the mic on in case I am speaking with a client and/or if it is hacked or viewed by someone other than myself.  If the device gets hacked, how will you know?<br/><br/>Night vision does not work when mounted behind a window.  If you mount the device outside, or facing into a room, it should work fine.  My cameras are both inside pointing at the street/cul-da-sac and front door entry way. through a window.  I am considering mounting one outside but not before I finish evaluating these device and trying to gain direct access.<br/><br/>Recently, Zmodo sent a service option to pay for video, image, and notification storage online.  I do not believe these services will improve the quality of service that I am experiencing.<br/><br/>I requested technical support to provide me a way to access the camera directly so I could use my own software but they have not replied, for the obvious reason, that they want to make money with the services they provide.  However, the company offers a recording device that can be purchased and used within your home.<br/><br/>Additional security available: I noticed that I can add a "device password" to each camera.  The User guide says "The password provides an additional layer of security but you will not need the password when access the camera from the Zmodo app".  It is not required but recommended.  So, set the password in either the app or the web site.<br/><br/>As a word of caution, anybody using the Zmodo, or other cameras that have a dedicated usage through the company web site, should ensure their password is hard to crack; at least 24 characters long including numbers, Uppercase, lowercase, and special characters.  The password should be changed in frequency of 30-60 days.  Why?  These cameras are part of the IoT (Internet of Things) and hackers have been able to find and take control of them for their own use.<br/><br/>Summary:<br/>When I was shopping around, these appear to be an inexpensive way to increase the security of my home.  They may not be as reliable as getting a dedicated system that offers recording in house, but it appears I am getting above 50% of the notifications I feel I should be getting.  Two more purchases I made: 1. motion sensing/auto on/off dusk-to-dawn lights for the house, where there were not-so-bright lights and we turned them off at night. 2. A sign that says "24-hour video surveillance" that is placed in the front yard.  Probably the best deterrent whether you have cameras or not.<br/><br/>Hope this helps<br/><br/>Update:<br/>Zmodo has been improving their mobile app and the app is a lot better.  I like the motion detection feature that now records 1 minute video when triggered.  Flipping through the cameras is nice, too. Still, access of the cameras is about 50% in my experience. I am still trying to determine the cause whether it be the camera or the service.  Since the camera reappears my guess is the service.  As stated, the only way to access the camera is through their app or website.  Most of the time I am use the browsers/website.  The video appears on it's own if not visible when first accessing it.  I can get the camera visible when unplugging the camera and back in and waiting for a short while for it to reconnect.<br/><br/>Update Jan 2-19<br/>Still trying to get notifications to no avail.  Support stopped communicating with me.  Notification stopped working months ago.  Contacted support got some responses but they wanted my password to test my results. Poor security suggestion to change password to 123456, Not good.  You should use strong password!!!!<br/><br/>Notifications still broke and still not resolved.  I recommend you pay more for better equipment.<br/><br/>Support said they would reset the cameras and I would have to add them again.  Not a problem but they are still in my account.  Support not responding after a couple emails after proposed reset.  My conclusion is they suck!  Cheap... "You get what you pay for".</span>

<span>Well, I did a lot of reading and researching on buying my folks some security cameras. They had some stuff taken from their back yard on different occasions, so it was time to place something to see if they can see anything. This is my honest opinion on my install to the use.<br/><br/>Set up- 2 out of 5 stars.<br/>So my parents have AT&amp;T, which has a dual router for 2.5 ghz and 5 ghz, however the cameras were not picking up the router. I had to change the 2.5 ghz network name as a result to split out 2.5 and 5 ghz. The actual process of getting them on the network was a pain, because I had to restart the application after 20 mins of failed attempts to getting them on the network. With that said, if your network is not detecting the camera’s make sure you have a 2.5 ghz modem. If you have verified that, then try closing the app and start over. I still have one more camera to install because I was not sure of the install piece as it was one that detected the network.<br/><br/>Install 4 out of 5<br/>I cannot put much of the install on the product, as with any system that is not battery operated has to have a cable installed. The reason I am not giving this 5 stars ie because the wires are not extremely rugged, meaning running them through ceiling, wood, or sheet rock I feel you have to use great caution or you will mess them up. The cords are not very long either, but you also have to find a power source, so finding a plug can be challenging, but again this is the owners issue not the product. I was lucky enough to have plugs close to where the installs were done, so a few drilled holes and I was good to go. However, I do recommend having extensions cords available.<br/>App Interface 4 out of 5<br/>The UI is ok, but the response is pretty solid. You can easily view these cameras as needed and you will receive notifications as motion is detected. You have the cloud, but can pay 4.99 a month to have a 7 day recall of footage. You can cut and trim footage as needed, you can also take screen shots of footage. You are also able to crop the area for motion detection, I am sure most people want the full picture to be detected, but if not, you have that option available.<br/>Camera’s 4 out 5<br/>The cameras seem durable and although they are light weight, look like they could take a fall, but obviously you do not want that to happen. The overall image is pretty good, I mean 720p is 720p and not 1080. When you go into the app there is an option of LD and HD. Not sure why LD is even there, because obviously you want the HD. The cameras have a good detection system of night and day and you get a decent picture even at night. There is no audio, so do not get these if you’re looking to scare of a potential robber through 2 way talking because there is 0 audio.<br/><br/>Overall I am satisfied with this purchase, not bad for $120, which included 4 cameras and 1 day shipping. The brand I had not heard of and was told the bandwidth on owners internet would be boggled down and customer service is nonexistent, but I can say I have not had any issues with either. Customer s service was available and provided screen shots in the app of what I needed assistance with (setting up a camera that was already on the network). I do look to buy 2 more of these cameras in the future. Another set up of eyes at the house when we are not there.</span>

<span>Purchased the 10 piece bundle.  Installation and setup were very simple and hassle free.  Everything works as the descriptions say it should.  "Professional monitoring" for this system at $27/monthly is roughly 30% of what I was paying that other company who's name begins with the letter "V", who reneged on their contract multiple times and who's "customer service" is in Guatemala (this week).  I am extremely satisfied with this purchase and will be adding more sensors and cameras in the future.  If you've been considering a Simplisafe system purchase, fear not!  You can do this.</span>

I don't have anything negative to say about this system so far.

<span>I love the image from these cameras. Now, you're definitely not getting Arri or red cinema camera quality. These are meant to be security cameras, and to be honest, the night vision and normal footage from these cameras are great. Two major issues for me that kill the benefits though.<br/><br/>Many times I attempted to record something, and it seems it is recording, yet later I find out nothing records. Turns out, the micro SD cards will not work for me. No matter what card I try and how many times I format outside and (successfully) inside the camera. The cards do not work, and you don't really know until you record and later find out nothing is there. Thats absolutely horrible!<br/><br/>The second thing is the field of view. An individual must be quite center or far out of the frame before they are in the field of view of this camera. When I purchased these, one thing on the comparison charts was the field of view. I paid no attention to it, because why would a security camer need me to be directly in the center of it, or at least 7-8 feet away from the camera until it picks me up? That makes no sense.<br/><br/>Another side note, I purchased the Kami mini camera option which is titled (face detection). Turns out the other model has firmware hacks which allow you to record to RTSP streams but this model doesnt. The Yi models can (by hacking them) allow you to stream a live feed to something like facebook or youtube. This would be great to have as you can then just constantly stream to a private RTSP stream on your own facebook or youtube and have a backup without worrying about memory cards or subscription services. Unfortunately, the model I purchased doesn't have this option.<br/><br/>If it is possible to change the field of view, or anyone knows the trick to the sd cards working, please let me know.</span>

<span>Guessing that a lot of these purchases are event driven and mine certainly is.  We have a cabin and a barn on a 6 acre piece of property.  The barn is where we park the tractor and store the supporting tools and supplies.  The barn was recently broken into and everything of value was taken.  While that is deeply disheartening, it really only affects me.  If the cabin were to be robbed and ransacked like the barn was, I have several young children that would likely never want to go/stay there again.<br/><br/>I do consider myself handy when it comes to mechanical and electronic projects.  I also believe that I am a good researcher and analyst.  I found that there are a lot of great alarm systems available at very affordable prices today including DIY professional systems. Several of the professional systems now have videos on installation and configuration—configuration used to be the tough part of installing one of those.<br/><br/>In my case, I was looking for a balance of price, ease installation and options for monitoring.  Given the recent break-in, I also wanted to get this project started and completed quickly as the cabin is just as vulnerable as the barn.<br/><br/>This next statement may make you question my research, or at least, reading abilities.  While I did plan to have the system monitored, I didn’t realize until after I purchased my SimpliSafe system that you can’t monitor the system remotely at all with the app without one of the SimpliSafe plans, and, at the time of this writing, March, 2021, you have to have the $25/mo. plan to do any serious monitoring.  I would have putt off having the system monitored for a while if that were not the case.  Perhaps it is better that I was forced into a plan earlier than I wanted.  As an aside, SimpliSafe gives you 3 days of ‘practice’ use after you activate your system.  This means they won’t contact local law enforcement if the system detects and alarm.  On the one hand I wanted my system monitoring to start immediately but, do understand the logic of giving me time to learn to use the system without causing false alarms.<br/><br/>The installation was truly easy.  Once you plug in the basestation and pull the battery tab on the keypad, you are off to a great start.  Installing any of the sensors is as easy as removing a paper battery tab, using the keypad to tell the basestation that you are installing a new device and naming it from a list once the basestation announces that a new device has been detected.  The preinstalled double sided tape makes mounting the sensors easy.  Our cabin has numerous unfinished roughhewn wood surfaces and I decided to mount sensors that had to be on those surfaces with the included screws.  I didn’t try the included self-adhesive on the roughhewn wood which, may have worked perfectly.<br/><br/>SimpliSafe tells you how far away you can mount sensors like the glass break and motion sensors but it was less clear about how high to mount them given the space I was working in or, for the glass break in particular, the angular range that it could work with.  For example, if you have windows on opposite sides of a room with no option to mount the sensor in the middle, can it detect glass breaking behind it or beside it?<br/><br/>SimpliSafe sensors are relatively inexpensive, and, as such, perhaps an extra sensor or two isn’t a bad thing.<br/><br/>The App is easy to set up and use and definitely slanted to the easy side rather than the comprehensive side.  That said, if a sensor were to drop off the app will alert you to that.  I am not looking forward to changing batteries but would rather that to running wires through an older structure.<br/><br/>SimpliSafe has done a great job making system purchase, installation and operation easy and straightforward.  They even sent me an e-mail letting me know that the county where my cabin is located requires a form and payment to be completed and sent to authorize monitoring and, more specifically, response.  Not only did they tell me about it, they sent me the exact link to the form.  They also let me know that no paperwork or fee was required for the fire monitor.<br/><br/>The cabin can be a relatively harsh environment with high humidity in the summer and relatively cold nights.  I am hoping the sensors, base station and keypad are rugged enough to function for years to come.<br/><br/>If you are looking at one of these systems, read all you can to understand what you can and can’t do with and without SimpliSafe’s monitoring options.  Watch or read about sensor placement and plan your own install.  I don’t think you have to become an alarm expert but each install has its own challenges. I found plenty of good information available from a lot of sources on the Internet to address those challenges.  I have not interacted with SimpliSafe’s customer service at this point and can’t comment on that aspect of the product.<br/><br/>Overall, I believe I made a good decision for my family and have only positive things to say about the installation and operation of my SimpliSafe system.</span>

<span>If you are on the fence about buying this, just do it!<br/>Here are my personal Pros:<br/>1) The cost. The quality of video and sound you get from this, you would expect to pay way more. However, there are companies who are selling cameras at a higher cost and the quality doesn't even compare to this) The quality. Both the sound and video quality are very well, even though the camera is on the other side of the house than the wi-fi receiver.<br/><br/>2.) The ease. This is by far one of the easiest cameras to set up. It is super user friendly and is practically ready to use out of the box. There is no waiting for charging, just set up an account, plug the camera in, follow the easy directions and you're done.<br/><br/>3.) Flexibility of storage. You have the option to pay for cloud storage OR you can simply purchase an TF card and use it for storage instead. Honestly, if you are using this just as your second pair of eyes as you leave the room for a bit, you may not even need storage. However, having the option to either pay for a subscription or purchase your own, is a huge positive. Most companies force you pay for a storage subscription in order to even work.</span>

<span>I used the SimpliSafe App on an iPhone to setup my new system because keypad setup process was slow and awkward.  One of the menu options is "Location Profile" which includes Property Name, Address, Add Primary Contact, and more.  I set up Property Name and hit Save, no problem.  Then I set up Address and hit Save -- the result was an error message "Device Connection Problem".  After checking the usual suspects and finding no cause, I called the support number.  The customer support person set the Address for me remotely, when I asked why I couldn't set it, she said it must a glitch with the app.  I tried changing a different field and it failed as well with the same error message.  I pressed the issue and was told that I have to subscribe to one of their services before I can set those fields.  There is nothing on the screen that indicates this area is for service subscribers only -- just an error message about device connections.  There are lots of ways for the company to deal with this, using misleading error messages should not be one of them.<br/><br/>On the positive side, the system seems to work well but I haven't had it for long.  Aside from the time I wasted with false error messages, the setup was ok --- just don't try to use the keypad unless you like a very awkward way to enter names and numbers.  Attaching the devices to walls was not easy since the adhesive tape doesn't hold very well (other's have warned about this) so I used screws too.  The screws do work but they are tiny and the Philips heads are too soft and way too easy to strip so use a screw driver with an exact fit.  The voice prompt is nice except when you are setting up a sensor in another room where you can't hear the voice prompt.  Overall, it is a good system with some really poorly done details and horrible UI design of the app and keypad.</span>

<span>I bought this system in early spring 2022 in order to replace my old system that had stopped working. I picked the SimpliSafe system because it offered cameras, door/window sensors, and a motion sensor all in one package. I wish I had chosen differently.<br/>PROS:<br/>1. The all-in-one system is convenient and there's no need to worry about piecing together different brands.<br/>2. SUPER easy to set up. I'm not a 'techy' person and I was still able to get the entire system set up in about an hour.<br/>3. Picture quality for cameras is clear and crisp – when they work.<br/>CONS:<br/>1.  The cameras are almost worthless. There is a delay in the motion sensor of about 30+ seconds. I have time to pull into my driveway and get all the way to my front door (about 25ft) before the camera “catches” me.<br/>2. When I receive a notification that the motion detector has triggered, it takes about 10 - 15 seconds to access the camera in the app, then another 10-15 seconds for the camera to activate. Then I get a message that the camera connection has been dropped and the camera is offline. My internet is working fine now (I've tested this at home) and it still happens. By the time I get the camera to work, whatever triggered the motion sensor is long gone.<br/>3. Without a monthly sub, there is no way to access the history so I can't see what caused the camera to trigger in the first place.<br/>4. Camera batteries are weak. I’ve only had my system up and running for about 2 months and my driveway camera battery already needs recharging. In comparison, the battery on my Ring doorbell lasts about 3 months.<br/>5. If your internet is down, there is no way to disarm the system. You can access the SimpliSafe app but the app won’t “talk” to the base station to deactivate the alarm. I came home one day and wasn’t aware my internet was out, and the alarm would not disarm. It screamed at me for the full 4 minutes before it finally quit. The pets were not amused. I’ve since installed a keypad so hopefully this won’t happen again.<br/>6. Cameras are mounted with a magnet. The camera base is screwed into the wall of the structure then the camera itself is held to that base by magnetization. If thieves are aware, they can just pluck them down and take them. I was not aware of this when I bought the system!! Super easy to install but not very secure.</span>

I have had to reinstall the software and the record and store option doesn't work well.  I have a good SD card installed, but the camera doesn't recognize it.<br/><br/>Sorry, it shouldn't be this hard to make this camera work and continue to do so.

<span>This "Konnek Stein 1080p Indoor Security Cameras" is low cost, but feels kind of flimsy and of low quality. I guess "you get what you paid for". This is camera's resolution is only at 1080, so it is worse than many webcams. But for a 1080 camera, it is relatively good (the resolution is just not high), so for indoor monitoring (to figure out whether there is someone or there isn't someone there), it is kind of ok; bit if you want to point it out a window, to try to get something detailed, like getting a license plate etc... this is not sufficient (you are better off trying to get something that support 4K). This camera also only support 2.4GHz wifi (not 5GHz). Also, lots of hiccups in using the software; the experience is not pleasant.<br/><br/>Thank you for reading this review, I hoped that this review is helpful to you in support of your purchase decision.</span>

<span>I picked up this security camera for my son and daughter-in-law's new house -- they were worried about a weak back door and wanted a camera to keep an eye on possible intruders.  It wasn't difficult to install, and the video image, when it worked, was good.  But it didn't work consistently.  Sometimes, it was great.  But most times it didn't work at all.<br/><br/>I'm not sure what the problem was.  The internet at the new house has been good, with no problems or interruptions.  It was just often difficult to get the camera to connect.  My son has been working with the camera for a few months now, trying to make changes that would help with its performance.  But the problems have persisted.<br/><br/>I do see that other reviewers have had similar problems.  The camera is a good one when it works.  But its inconsistency a big negative.</span>
