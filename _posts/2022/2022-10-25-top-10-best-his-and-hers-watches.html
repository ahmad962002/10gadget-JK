<span>I've owned alot of watches in the past so when my last fossill watch broke I didn't like the new ones  tested alot of different watch brands that would not leak water and would be made to last. I tested this Invicta in the ocean swimming, shower, you name it haven't taken it off now I understand why people like to collect these now I'm hooked! I bought this one on sale can't believe what I paid for a great quality watch!! One thing it's heavier and a little bigger than the cheap watches on the market but it grows on yah just love it!</span>

<span>Couldn’t tell if this watch was real or not. The watch back didn’t have Michael Kors written across. Typically Michael Kors watches have this. The box didn’t have the name Michael Kors on the edge like it’s suppose to. The color of the box was a light white color but the real one has a brown color. There was no manual, real Michael Kors watch has this in the box. There was no extra link in the box, real Michael Kors watch comes with this. The watch was very nice, the name Michael Kors was engraved like it’s supposed to be. The dials all have different functions like it’s suppose to. The knob on the side of the watch was engraved with the MK. Oh and the real Michael Kors watch is suppose to have a gold clasp this watch was gold but the inside of the clasp was stainless steel. Over all I just couldn’t tell if it was real or not so I returned it.</span>

<span>My previous wrist watch ran out of batteries so I either had to buy more batteries for the watch I was wearing or to buy a brand new watch - which is what I did - and, in retrospect, I'm so glad I did!  This watch is so beautiful!  It is chock full of fake diamonds which actually look quite impressively real!<br/><br/>The fit is tight but not uncomfortable.  The band is made of gold, or at least looks like gold and is very pretty and feminine.  There are several fake diamonds that are placed around the face of the watch.  There are no numbers on the watch, per se. However there are small gold dots placed in each space where the five, ten, fifteen, twenty, etc, etc go.  I think when the batteries die in this watch, I am going to take the time to replace them.  This watch is well worth the money - and the beauty it resonates is amazing!</span>

<span>I liked this watch, but I did not realize how big and heavy it would be.  My wrists are slim, and it felt like I was wearing an anvil on my wrist.  The face of the watch was definitely too big for my wrist.  I returned it, and I will find something smaller to buy.  :(</span>
