<span>Very easy to install on pre wired RV.  Picture quality is good as well as sound. I like seeing the road behind me. If I bought again, I would get a larger monitor. The 4.3 screen is a little small but still good.</span>

<span>Just ok, these should only be couple hundred bucks, not worth it for the money way over priced!</span>

<blockquote><em><div class="a-row a-spacing-small review-data"><span class="a-size-base review-text review-text-content" data-hook="review-body">
<span>As a stand alone unit it is about right BUT what is not mentioned is that it can not be used with the side cameras because the screen is way to small. If you check on the side camera addition it does say that they work with "S" series screens. But what the side cameras do not state is that you must have the 5 inch screen or bigger. Yes the 4.3 inch screen does work with the side cameras but you can not see anything bigger than a postage stamp. So needless to say since my coach is 40 long looking at a postage stamp is not going to work. But if you want a back up camera that is wireless for your vehicle this one will work fine and the price is right</span>

<span>It seems to be working ok so far. Screen seems somewhat cheap but had been giving very crisp images until I turned it on for the picture in the review, it now has vertical lines. Guess we will see if the lines go away now. Cameras give good picture. Wish the rear camera had more of a fish-eye lens so I could see more. Record function hasn't worked yet, doesn't seem to recognize the sd card but that feature was not a must have for me. Overall, I guess you get what you pay for, but it does the job for a somewhat reasonable price.</span>

<span>I paired these right and left side cameras with a rear camera and 5-inch screen on a  38ft 5th wheel.  I guess I've become accustomed to driving and backing without side camera assistance. After 2 trips with the side cameras in place, I never found that the cameras gave me any advantages. For me, the 5inch screen seemed cluttered with 3 camera views plus it didn't provide any additional visual information that I wasn't getting from my rear camera or side mirrors. The same thing with backing. The cameras just didn't provide anything extra. If I was unsure of a side obstacle while backing I'd rather just get out and look for my own visual reference.<br/>Otherwise easy install and pairing</span>

<span>OK; this is a great backup camera &amp; monitor system for just about any vehicle.  And yes, as others have stated the wiring diagrams/instructions are useless, hence the 4 star review.  I did the installation myself in a 2008 Ford Fusion for my son - it took us about 3.5 hours.<br/><br/>Here are some very helpful hints if you plan to do this yourself:<br/>1.  The actual backup camera must be installed right-side up.  Which way is that you ask?  The adjustment screws for the camera must be facing downwards.<br/>2.  The video cable (yellow RCA plugs on either end) also has a red wire that runs alongside (not pictured in the product photos!).  Do not ignore as others have done, as this is used to automatically power on the monitor when reverse is engaged.<br/>3.  The camera has two leads off of it; one is yellow, and this is the video feed that will connect to the long video cable to the monitor.  The other is red - this will be your power source to the camera.  It has a corresponding plug that ends with a black &amp; red wire.  Take the red wire and splice into the power lead to your reverse light, and connect the black wire to a ground source (tap a screw on your vehicle's frame).<br/>4.  Remember the red wire that runs along the video cable?  One end of this should ALSO tap into the powered line of the reverse light - WITH the red wire from the camera power feed (as noted above).  Note that you will almost certainly require extra wiring in order to accomplish this, so have it on hand before the install.  It simply isn't long enough and ends too close to the video RCA plug.  The other end will be spliced to the green wire from the monitor (this wiring bundle is also not shown in any of the product pictures here).<br/>5.  Before ordering this system, look over the interior of your vehicle and try to determine where you will run the video cable.  You could opt to run it beneath the carpet floor on up to the front of the car - or look for a cable channel found in a lot of cars - this can usually be found in the bottom of the car's door frame sills.  If you do run the cable underneath carpet - make sure you have a wire fisher; this will help considerably.  You can also remove carpeting, but I don't recommend this...<br/>6.  Both the mounts for the monitor are a little flimsy (there is a square nut in both mounts along with a tightening wheel - DO NOT OVERTIGHTEN or you will crack the back casing of the monitor).<br/>7.  The easiest way to power the front monitor is by using the cigarette lighter socket and a plug is provided; just splice the corresponding wires together.  Otherwise, you will either need to find a 12volt power lead inside the car (fusebox or even tap the cigarette lighter from behind).<br/>8.  You may need to be prepared to drill a hole somewhere near the rear license plate in order to run the camera's cables into the interior of your vehicle; this may be vehicle dependent but again, be prepared.  Look at your license plate beforehand and imagine running the camera's two cables (power and video) to the inside for a better idea.<br/>10. Be prepared to remove interior panels (most likely in the trunk) in order to route wiring.  Usually it's just plastic plugs that pop out (gently use a flat-bladed screw driver) and will pop back in.<br/>11.  My last tip (and this helped me quite a bit): before your installation, place the camera on a table or floor.  Start hooking up all the wires and lay it out like it will be in your car.  Look to see how it all connects together BEFORE you are halfway through your install :-)  As others have mentioned, go to the PyleAudio website and navigate to the product page; there you will find only a slightly helpful wiring schematic but it is marginally better than what comes in the box.<br/><br/>If you wire/hook up as I have above, then when you engage reverse the monitor will automatically turn on and you will have an instant backup view.  As soon as you disengage from reverse the monitor will turn off.  Done!</span>

<span>So far, so good.  Installation was not too difficult.<br/><br/>* I ran a good quality shielded RCA cable from rear backup camera yellow plug to front yellow plug on monitor wiring harness.  There are two up front - only one fits - the AV2.<br/>*  A separate trigger wire taps off the backup light +12v and runs to the green wire on monitor harness.  Check which backup light wire is +12v with a cheap meter.  Put one meter probe (black) to bare metal on car frame like trunk latch.  Then use the red probe to see which backup light wire is +12v.  The +12v backup wire will cause meter to show a voltage value when in reverse (be careful).  That is your trigger connection.<br/>* Also connect the red on the backup camera to the +12v on the backup light.  When the backup light comes on in reverse, the camera has power and the monitor is triggered on.<br/>*  Ground (black) is to car body at the camera and up front at the monitor harness.  Must be bare metal.<br/>*  An add-a-circuit fuse box tap gives the monitor +12v ignition on.  These are little plugs that replace a fuse.  Find your ACC fuse slot, plug in the add-a-circuit, put two new fuses on the add-a-circuit (I used 10amp) and run the red wire from the add-a-circuit to the monitor wiring harness red wire. When the ignition is on, the monitor has power.<br/><br/>Picture in day is wide at 16:9 and clear with bright colors.  Picture at night is OK and a bit grainy.  I did replace stock backup bulbs with brighter LED and disabled license plate light above camera.  The monitor is BIG.  Almost true double DIN and Pyle engineers could have improved the product with double DIN mounting ability. As it was, I bought a Metra double DIN radio mount and modified to fit on 2003 Honda Accord.<br/><br/>And if monitor is always on when you turn the key and says "no signal", press the Power button to turn the monitor off and let trigger circuit turn it on.</span>

<span>Tested on a lab power supply, looked GREAT so I installed it on the truck.<br/>It only works if the battery voltage is over about 12.5, can only be used it when the engine is running.  Checked that battery voltage was getting to the camera and video display.  With engine running there is interference on the screen but I suspect it is related to the power supply problem.<br/>Control buttons no longer work or actually some do, some don't and the others have switched functions.<br/>Minor item, there is no "Invert Screen" if you have to mount the camera upside down ( or at least I couldn't find it with the corrupted controls).<br/>Minor item.  The cable exit from the camera frame only exits one way (up) so if you have to mount at the bottom of the  license plate (because top is obstructed by the license plate light) you have to loop the wire over the camera.  An Invert Screen feature would have solved this!<br/>Minor item.  The bright blue illuminated buttons make viewing the picture difficult in the dark - no way to dim them or turn them off.<br/><br/>I've ordered a replacement, I'll update here if it works correctly.<br/><br/>UPDATE New one is working fine BUT AN INSTALLATION WARNING<br/><br/>The cable between the monitor and the camera includes an extra wire for running +12 volts.<br/>Since it was easy to access the backup light power near the camera at the rear and since it was nearly impossible to locate the backup circuit in the cab and since I didn't want an ugly cable going to the cigarette outlet, I opted to use this extra wire to feed 12 volts from the backup light to the monitor - MUCH NEATER.<br/>BUT DON'T DO IT.<br/>The extra red cable (that runs along with the video cable) is totally inadequate for carrying the current to the monitor and aggravates the low voltage sensitivity.<br/>Since there are virtually no installation instructions you have to discover this the hard way and create a warranty return.</span>

<span>The goal was to be able to see the rear and sides as we travel, backing up is just a bonus. Easy install.</span>

<span>Two hour installation. Instructions for direct pairing of backup camera was understandable. But instructions for how to direct connect side marker camera light assemblies to monitor, for pairing, was less then helpful. Box did contain the appropriate connector but you need to have some electrical experience to figure it out. You'll need to install small grey connector, with red/black push pins, to pig-tails of side marker camera/light assy. Then connect to Y cord used also for backup camera. This allows you to pre-pair cameras to monitor, verify operability, and adjust orientation prior to mounting on trailer. You of course need to provide 12V power to monitor &amp; side camera via provided cigarette plug, plus provided 3 way power connection cord.<br/>My trailer was pre-wired with Furrion bracket. I remove U bracket from camera, installed provided adapter bracket and mounted camera to Furrion cover plate which I modified so I could reuse it.</span>

<span>I love these cameras! I got the rear view and the side view cameras for my 33 ft Entegra Odyssey and what a difference. I seldom even need the wife to guide me into any camp site and I can now see all around my vehicle when I’m driving. The only complaints I have is the wiring was very small, brittle and cheap. I actually broke the wires several times during the installation. My other complaint was the mirror mount I was forced to buy separately because I didn’t have enough space for any of the other mounting solutions. The mirror mount is basically a thick rubber band and a flimsy plastic base plate that holds the monitor to the mirror. The mount itself was fairly cheap but once you add the incredibly expensive shipping fees it was over $40. For the price they should include a choice of mounting solutions including the mirror mount. What a rip off!</span>
