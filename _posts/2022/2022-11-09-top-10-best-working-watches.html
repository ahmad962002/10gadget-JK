<blockquote><em><div class="a-row a-spacing-small review-data"><span class="a-size-base review-text review-text-content" data-hook="review-body">
<span>***UPDATED***<br/><br/>First Review:<br/>I recently had a malfunction: the stopwatch function “froze” and I can’t reset or get out of the “time” mode.  I just checked and am beyond the Amazon return window (purchased in May, return window expired in June…it’s now late July).  I’ve read a ton of reviews that say the company doesn’t stand behind their product.  The jury is still out in my case so let’s see how they respond.  I’m not going to mention my occupationS or experience, that is reserved for review #2 after I see how they respond.  For the record, I also own an MC-2 Compass (made by the same company) and it’s world renowned, so I have high hopes they do the right thing.  We shall see, more to come.  July 23, 2022<br/><br/>Review #2 (September 18, 2022):<br/>It’s a good watch!  I’m in Law Enforcement (Highway Patrol &amp; Marine Unit), so I NEEDED a good watch.  This one is hard to read at night (small numbers/characters and low backlight brightness), the included “Quick Guide” (all FOUR of them) only tell a small part of the story of this watch.  To fully understand its capabilities and how to use it effectively, you’ll need that quick guide and all 33-pages of the user manual that you’ll have to download from their website.  When I said “and”, I literally mean you need them BOTH (photo attached) to understand how to use all of the functions because neither does an effective job explaining how the thing works!<br/><br/>I’m my first review I mentioned a malfunction.  Well, it ended up being operator error on my part because I literally didn’t understand that it had gone into locked mode AND I couldn’t see the teeny, tiny little padlock icon that said it was in locked mode!  Did I mention it’s hard to see/read?  That became even more challenging because I had accidentally changed the language to something other than English and what little chance I had to recover was totally gone once it changed to some other language.<br/><br/>If you wear glasses, be sure to use them whenever you’re setting or using anything other than the most basic functions (cycling through date, sunrise/sunset, stopwatch, timer, compass, altimeter, barometer).  The user interface isn’t user-friendly or even intuitive so prepare to start memorizing which buttons perform which function when you’re doing anything other than cycling through available menus.<br/><br/>Again, it’s a good watch…very good even!  I returned it for repair and they promptly returned it with the explanation that I didn’t know how to use it (those are my words, they were much more polite and professional…thanks to them for that!)<br/><br/>I was so frustrated when it was stuck in locked mode that I bought an Ironman (100m waterproof model) on-sale for $39.95.  I can actually read and manipulate its functions at night, without reading glasses and the buttons are ultra-intuitive!!!!  Sure it doesn’t have a compass, altimeter or barometer but for a basic rugged watch you can see (even at night without glasses or a magnifying glass), it’s kinda hard to beat since I swim often and waterproofing really matters.  This Suunto cost $125 on Amazon and it’s a better watch than the Ironman I just mentioned simply because of its highly advanced capabilities.  Just be prepared to do a ton of learning to use it effectively and efficiently in the field!<br/><br/>I give the Suunto Core All Black a solid 4-Stars for quality, aesthetics, capabilities, and durability.  The manual(s), display readability, and intuitive user interface all SUCK but I’m only going to dock them 1-Star for all of those because they should be easily correctable.  …it’s a very good watch!</span>

<span>*15 month(ish) later update. Surprisingly there isn't much new to say that I didn't already mention in my initial review, so I just wrote additional commentary in the relevant sections instead of writing a full-fledged update. I did have to do a battery change at 14 months and it's currently running on its new battery, more details on that in the appropriate section.*<br/><br/>I will continue to keep this review updated as I spend more time using the watch.<br/><br/>I'm a long time outdoor instructor and a working and sport dog handler. My cheap analog/digital watch of the last 9 years finally gave out on me and I decided it was time to upgrade to something better. I liked the idea ABC functions in the watch form factor. Historically I relied on larger handheld units but it's nice to have the capability of ditching them for shorter excursions and everyday use.<br/><br/>So far, I really like the Core. In my opinion the unit ticks off all the necessary functions for a good work watch. The utility of date and seconds mode are obvious, the stopwatch and countdown clock are wonderful functions for use in the field and training, and dual time is an excellent feature when traveling. It's not the most unique feature but I really appreciated the easy access to the sunrise and sunset times. It's really great to be able to click a few buttons so I can make plans for sun down accordingly. *Still love the sunrise and sunset display. It's great for K9 detection and tracking*<br/><br/>I haven't had a ton of time to play with the atmospheric barometer and altimeter but my quick tests have found it to be consistent with the results that my Foretrex spits out. I look forward to putting it alongside some other units and testing out the 'automatic' profile when I'm done with trials. For users like myself who are accustomed to atmospheric barometers that auto recalculate with a GPS, be sure to remember to set your reference altitude. The current heatwave means I haven't been able to try the storm alarm yet but I can't wait to test it out because it could prove to be extremely handy in the field. I was glad to find that the unit includes a thermometer. It should be noted that the thermometer spends its time pressed up against your wrist so when wearing the watch the readings will be wrong. To Suunto's credit they do mention this in the user manual found on their website. But it's readings appear to be pretty accurate when removed from your wrist for a few minutes. And even then in this current mid-90s degree it's readings on wrist have been pretty close. *Barometer still works really well as long as you update it. Storm alarm has gone off a few times but hasn't done so before an actual storm. I don't think this is an issue with the alarm just the ambient pressure of my location. Thermometer is great to have. This year I had a contract at a location that had obscenely high temperatures, and a dozen and a half years working in the outdoors it's the closest I've ever gotten to a heat-related injury. The on board thermometer help me track my status and recovery.*<br/><br/>One of my teaching specialties is land navigation and I'm a bit of a compass nerd. So I was very curious to see how the compass mode would perform. It is my opinion that a electric compass in this form factor will never replace a good analog compass. The utility of a unit like this isn't in its accuracy or precision but in its convenience. To that end, this unit is very convenient to use with a few hiccups. Initially I had a lot of issues with the compass being wildly inaccurate. And I had no success with recalibration. I found a YouTube comment on the official Suunto tutorial about compass recalculating that suggested a reset. That suggestion worked wonders and the compass worked extremely well after calibration... for a few hours. I put the watch down by my phone and computer while doing some work and then left it there when I took a nap. When I woke up and tested it again it was out of whack and I needed to do another factory reset. In retrospect this is blaringly obvious but the magnetic interference for my computer equipment was responsible. Keep that in mind if you're having issues with the compass. Like any compass, this unit needs to be kept level if you want accurate readings. At least for me, it can be difficult to judge what's level when the unit is on my wrist. With practice and more use I'm sure this will become less of an issue for me but it does introduce a degree of mistrust in the readings when not checking a known direction. It's a shame that Suunto didn't include the bubble level that was found on the old Vectors. Like any good compass, the unit has adjustable declination. In 0.5 degree increments, larger than I would like but adequate for a unit like this. *Have still not been able to calibrate the compass. In the last 15 months I have spent hours trying. So whenever I need to recalibrate I just reset the watch.*<br/><br/>You'll see a lot of complaints in the Amazon reviews about the dim display. Personally I have not had that issue. It is very readable in bright light. In low light I find it just as readable as a regular analog. It does have a backlight which is just bright enough to illuminate in low and no light. I do miss the utility of having glow in the dark watch hands but that's just one of the trade-offs of going digital. Is my understanding that you can adjust the contrast after a factory reset but I haven't felt the need. And this is from someone who doesn't have particularly good eyesight. *Absolutely no problems with the display in a wide range of lighting conditions*<br/><br/>I don't like the included silicone watch band. It's comfortable, easily adjustable, and breathable in hot weather but it means that watch can't lie flat when the watch is removed and I found it made compass calibration more annoying than it needed to be. I can't speak for the durability of the band yet but even outside of the world of Amazon reviews these new silicone bands are notorious within my professional communities for breaking unexpectedly and at the worst possible times. I would have greatly preferred the NATO style bands that ship with the new Alpha Stealth version of the Core. I will probably replace the band at some point in the future with a aftermarket band. *Still don't like the included band but it's held up and haven't had any issues with it. Haven't found an aftermarket alternative that I like.*<br/><br/>Can't speak for battery life yet but I like that it uses the same coin batteries as my RMR. What concerns me is the somewhat inconsistent information about battery replacement. With Suunto simultaneously providing instructions and kits for battery replacement but also suggesting that trying to replace the battery on your own voids the warranty. And when investigating further it gets even more unclear about who actually is authorized to do the replacement. I may end up calling my local REI and asking if that's a service that they actually provide (the Suunto website claims they do) just to have options open. *Battery gave out on a contract about 14 months after receiving the watch. Because of the timing I just replaced the watch battery myself and didn't deal with any of the warranty maintenance stuff. I had a surprising amount of trouble opening the case, the coins I had on hand were either too thick or thin to adequately turn the coin slot. Ended up using a shotgun hull. Make sure you look up replacement instructions so you know what to do with the silicone o rings.*<br/><br/>I also can't speculate on long-term durability yet. As a precaution I did purchase one of those extended warranties/insurance policies from Amazon for the first time. Much like the silicone watch bands, Suunto is infamous for it's for poor or inconsistent warranty support in my communities. Hopefully I won't have to find out or see how well the third party one works. *Still looks pretty good after 15 months of nearly daily use*</span>

<span>I like just about everything about this watch.  I use it primarily as an altimeter for map and compass land navigation while adventure racing.  As near as I could tell, the altimeter tracked well after factoring in changes in barometric pressure.  The display is a bit dim in daylight, but I was always able to read it.  My teammate has a similar watch, and both read reliably within a couple feet of each other.<br/><br/>My one complaint is the number of button presses required to recalibrate the altimeter when crossing a point where we knew for a fact the elevation.  I didn't count, but it's gotta be 5-7 presses just to get into and out of the correct menu.  I used to run a cheapo timex or casio (can't remember) and it was a grand total of two button presses.<br/><br/>It's a minor complaint, and I'd gladly buy this watch again.</span>

<span>I will start my review with an admission:<br/><br/>I hate digital watches.<br/><br/>I think 7-segment numbers look ugly, and I prefer the ability to see the 'distance' between times visually that you get with an analog face.<br/><br/>But I needed the timer and lap counter for my job, and I have always wanted to do interval training to improve my speed and endurance while cycling.  This watch had everything I needed and more.  I was aware that Timex was a respected brand, and the T5E231 was the only watch in my price range with the ability to count 199 laps.<br/><br/>I have to say, though, that after a week of use, I actually love this watch.  Not only does it meet my needs functionally, but it actually brings me pleasure to wear it and operate it.  The yellow trim around the inside of the bezel clearly identifies it as a sport watch, yet it seems to fit in well in formal settings.  The interface is incredibly user-friendly and satisfying to operate.  I never thought I would refer to a watch's "interface", but this watch actually has one.  Pressing most of the buttons results in actual text being displayed on the screen telling you what the button did, or what will happen if you hold that button down just a little longer.  In most modes there are even little labels that appear on the screen by the buttons telling you what they do in that mode.  Figuring out how to use almost all of the functions only required five minutes of random experimentation.  The only thing I had to consult the manual about was how to switch the chronograph into lap counter mode.  I just wish there instructions explaining how to fold the manual back into a size that fits inside the watch stand.<br/><br/>There are so many little touches that make it clear the designers at Timex really take pride in their work.  Here are my favorites:<br/><br/>-When turning night mode on, the Indiglo lingers for another few seconds after releasing the button.  But when turning it off, the light extinguishes immediately!  It should, since if you are turning night mode off, it's probably daytime and you don't need the Indiglo anymore.<br/>-Being able to scroll numbers backwards and forwards while setting times.  On other watches it is so frustrating to 'miss' the number you want and have to press the button 60 more times.<br/>-Little icons appear on the home screen letting you know if the timer, chronograph, or alarm is running in the background.  Most watches only have an icon for the alarm.<br/>-The speaker plays a different sound for the alarm and the timer, so you know which one is going off without looking at the screen.  Also the Indiglo light flashes.<br/>-The Indiglo system is clearly a masterwork of engineering.  It looks evenly lit and is very easy to read, yet it doesn't illuminate anything other than the display (unlike the backlight on a phone, for example).  This must save a lot of battery power, since lighting up other objects around the watch is a waste of electricity.  Besides, you have your phone for that!<br/>-In timer mode, you can see what time the timer was originally set for on another line below the countdown.<br/>-The AM and PM appear in the same place on the display; there is just one little segment that lights up to turn the P into an A.<br/>-Many of the buttons that perform an irreversible or potentially unwanted function (such as resetting the chrono or clearing workout data) require being held down for several seconds so you don't trigger them accidentally.<br/>-The watch tells you how much memory is free for storing workouts.<br/><br/>There is only one problematic thing about this watch (and it may actually be a problematic thing about myself).  In order to activate the FLIX system I am required to wrench my arm so hard I nearly dislocate it.  It is painful, and takes way more effort than just pressing the Indiglo button.  This doesn't bother me, because I didn't buy this watch with the intention to ever use FLIX, but it is somewhat frustrating that it is so hard to use.  However, it is possible that my technique is flawed, and there is an easier movement that will activate it.  But I don't really want to experiment; I like my arm in its current uninjured state.<br/><br/>In all, I am very satisfied with my purchase.  I love everything it does, and the only 'negative' probably says more about me than it does about the watch.  Considering my abhorrence of digital watches, I am surprised that I like this one so much.  I don't plan to wear it any other time than while at work or working out, but for those times it is not only tolerable, but actually enjoyable.<br/><br/>I highly recommend this watch!</span>

<blockquote><em><div class="a-row a-spacing-small review-data"><span class="a-size-base review-text review-text-content" data-hook="review-body">
<span>I am coming from a 2 year old Fitbit Ionic that isn't working well any longer.  Garmin is one of the big names in fitness tracking, so I thought I would give them a try.  So far I've tried the Fenix 6s Pro and the Venu.<br/><br/>There is a lot to like about the Venu.  The screen is very bright and colorful.  I had some concerns that because it is an OLED screen, it would be difficult to see in direct sunlight.  There was no need to worry about that, however, as it is easy to see even with the sun directly overhead.  Unfortunately, Garmin is under-utilizing the screen technology pretty badly.  There are not a lot of good watch faces available.  One would expect that to change, though, as the watch becomes more popular. Though not as robust as the Fenix 6s Pro, the Venu has more fitness metrics than I know what to do with.  What it has is perfect for my fitness regimen.  Though the Fenix 6s Pro was a nice watch, it was too much for me.  The Venu fits perfectly with what I need and is so much more than my Fitbit ever was.<br/><br/>Where it falls down, at least for me, is in heart rate measurement.  It simply is not accurate.  To test this out, I spent a lot of time taking my heart rate manually and checking it against the Venu.  When sedentary, it is pretty close.  But as soon as I get up and move around, the Venu displayed a much higher heart rate than it should have.  I'd stand up and walk 10 feet and the Venu would display 101 as my heart rate.  When I took it manually, it was 77.  It was also badly inaccurate when working out with weights or pull-ups.  In those cases, it measured way too low.  One great thing is that a separate heart rate monitor can be attached to it.  I bought one and use it whenever I am doing any exercise.  Oh, and the one place where the heart rate does appear accurate is when walking or hiking.  Strange as it is to say, my old Fitbit Ionic did a better job of measuring heart rate on a consistent basis than any other device I've ever had.<br/><br/>Another complaint is just the layout of the menus and options on the watch.  None of it is particularly well thought out or easy to work through.  Different items are not where you would expect them and it took some time to figure out where different settings were located.  Fortunately, Garmin has great instruction manuals available online.  After a while, I got used to where to find everything.  And this complaint extends to the Garmin Connect app itself.  All of the settings are buried in different watch independent and dependent menus and it's a guess where anything is.  It took some time to work through that as well and I still find myself hunting around for things a month later.  The display of the fitness data, however, is great.  Everything can be found in Garmin Connect and on their website.<br/><br/>Sleep tracking on this watch is just plain poor.  Ridiculously, embarrassingly  bad.  There were nights when it recorded just a minute or two of awake time.  I am not a good sleeper and I routinely have over an hour of awake time each night.  This is one area in which Fitbit devices excelled.  After two nights, I started taking the watch off at night and putting it on the charger.  And I had to turn it off, otherwise it still recorded sleep when not being worn.<br/><br/>The other measurement that is very important to outdoor activities is GPS and I can say after using it for a while that it is very accurate.  Especially coming from an Ionic where it would routinely be a quarter of a mile off in either direction at any time.  The Venu will measure the same walking path within a couple of a hundredths of a mile each and every time.  As I stated earlier, there are two Venu watches being used in my home.  They usually show the exact same distance.  This is about as good as it gets and was a nice surprise after being on the Fitbit for so long.<br/><br/>Regarding connectivity between the device and my phone, I had no problem.  It connected immediately and stayed connected.  Notifications came through with no problem.  It is easy to set up notifications for only certain apps, all apps, or just to completely shut it off.  The one negative that I noticed is that the bluetooth does not have the range of other devices connected to my phone.  For it to be reliable, you have to keep the phone pretty close.  This isn't a big deal for many people, but it was a bit bothersome for me as I tend to keep my phone on the charger in a different room.  One thing that I did almost immediately was shut off the not connected notification because it was going off frequently when I'd walk away from my phone.  It got annoying.<br/><br/>Pros<br/>Plenty of fitness metrics.<br/>Battery life on it really is great and lives up to the Garmin hype.  It does last days, even with a decent amount of GPS use.<br/>The GPS is spot on.<br/>Great, easy to read screen.  No need to worry about visibility in even the brightest of sunlight.<br/>Very light and comfortable on the wrist.  I have a more slender wrist and it still fits well.  For the size of the watch, I would have expected it to be heavier but they use some lightweight materials in the case.  In spite of that, it feels sturdy.<br/><br/>Cons<br/>At least for me, the heart rate monitoring was badly off, and an inaccurate heart rate can lead to other inaccurate metrics.  Searching the forums and the Garmin subreddit, I do see others complaining about it as well.<br/>Sleep tracking simply does not work.  I no longer use it because there just wasn't any point.<br/>The layout of the menu needs a rework.  It is not intuitive and there is a bit of a learning curve to learn where everything is located.<br/>The screen is very nice, but Garmin is not taking full advantage of it.  They could do so much more with it, but it has the same layout as all other Garmin watches of its type, including colors.  Hopefully in the future, Garmin will take more advantage of the technology that it offers.<br/>Bluetooth stays connected very well, but at a shorter range than typical bluetooth devices.  I have to stay closer to my phone for a reliable connection.<br/><br/>I still haven't decided if I am going to keep it or not.  An inaccurate heart rate is a pretty big deal for a fitness watch.  The thing is, I am not sure what else is out there that is better.  The fitbit that I'm coming from had so many problems that it was not worth it.  Keeping it connected to my phone reliably was a daily challenge.  And Fitbit devices seem to last until just after the warranty expires.  I'm also trying out a Samsung Active 2, but that isn't really as geared toward fitness as they'd like you to think.  They're more concerned with the smart watch aspect of it.  So in the end, this watch might be the best solution.<br/><br/>One other thing - make sure to get a screen protector for it.  It is one big piece of glass and according to my research the Gorilla Glass that they use on it isn't the most scratch resistant.  You will be touching the screen a lot and it will end up scratched.  Unfortunately there aren't a lot of good screen protector options out there.  I just picked up one of the cheap film protectors to cover it until something better comes along.</span>

<span>I've worn this every day since it arrived. I plug it in to charge once a week, it seems to only take a couple hours. I thought seeing my texts, calendar and email would be gimmicky but I really love it now. Sleep tracking, women's health, steps, hills, gps are all spot on &amp; helpful. I'm still wondering if stress and body battery readings are accurate because if they are I might be a walking miracle. So many ways to personalize the watch face and the band options are endless.</span>

<span>First, for years I wanted one of these "Mr Daddy" watches. Diesel has a great reputation, and the watch looked perfect in all the photos. But when I opened the box, I was a little shocked. This 57mm watch isn't just large, it is HUGE. It reached beyond the sides of my wrist! You gotta be a really big guy to wear this without it looking like it should be around your neck on a chain ... rapper style. It is a shame, a little smaller, like 55mm and it might have been fine. It was just too much watch. So I returned it and purchased a smaller Diesel.</span>

<span>I always liked big watches so a Diesel Watch was a natural choice .  I just  had a little trouble figuring out how to adjust the time zone 4 display .  Unlike the other 3 time zones you need to grip it from the bottom instead of pulling straight out when pulling out the crown .  I like the 4 time zone display and the color.  I know this watch goes for over $400 in regular departments stores . So  I paid a really good price,  I can't answer for the watch being water proof .  It probably could take a few rain drops.  My personal opinion ,  I would not wear it in the shower or at  the swimming pool .  This watch is worn to get attention.  Overall a great watch for fans of big display watches</span>

The only thing that makes me want to buy a new one is the single flaw I see in G-Shocks; the little plastic band that holds the strap down in place. After a few years they get brittle and break. An easy fix,(you can get replacement parts through G-Shock &amp; replace the band yourself or even take it to a watch shop) but instead I decide its time to treat myself to a new watch.<br/><br/>This has to be the nicest looking one I’ve bought yet, and I have no question that it will be just as durable as the others, if not more so. The metal wiring around it only makes it stronger. I work in the construction industry and am also a very active outdoorsman(fishing, mountain biking, camping etc etc etc) and almost never take off my watch for any of the above. No, it does not come in the classic G-Shock tin, but its a damn box thats useless once I put the watch on so  I’m well over that.<br/><br/>This watch was released in 2014 so its price has gone down all the way to $77 for the grey/green colored one. The one warning ill issue to anyone who decides to buy this watch is that G-Shocks usually come with the battery already on, so the battery may not last as long as expected due to the fact that its an older model. Another easy fix should the battery die. Overall, a great purchase and I look forward to getting some good years out of this watch until the time comes once again to order a new one. Enjoy!</span>

<span>My 11-year-old son loves his new watch. I cannot attest to the water resistance as he hasn’t got it wet yet. It keeps good time but setting the date is a little tricky because you need to do it at a certain time of day or it won’t be correct. The ticking isn’t too loud and he actually likes that about it. I hope it doesn’t have issues like some of the other reviews I’ve seen with the crown falling off.<br/><br/>Great watch! But… Very upset with Amazon on this order. This was a present and it didn’t arrive until over a week after it was supposed to be received and their outsourced customer service transferred me around in circles and lied to me about the reason why it was over a week late stating someone else bought the last one right before I bought this for my son. They called it a “team-x” What a joke!</span>

<span>An inexpensive alternative to the discontinued Seiko style I wore for over 50yrs.  Clean, attractive, FUNCTIONAL.<br/>Time is easy to read in daylight.  Luminous hands glow faintly all night long, but Timex didn't make hour markers luminous, so the only way to be certain of the time in the dark is to use the "Indiglow" feature (draining battery).<br/>Date too tiny to read, but that's not a dealbreaker for me.<br/>Would have preferred a rubber or metal strap to leather (durability &amp; waterproof).

<span>This is my second Timex purchased on Amazon in the past 4 years, and like the first, this Expedition Scout (left in the pic) hit the mark.<br/><br/>Pros:<br/>- It looks great with a black matte case. The stem is large enough to easily change the minute and hour independently.<br/>- The NATO band gives a rugged outdoors look and made of sturdy nylon to hold up under outdoor conditions<br/>- The face is easy to read even in dim lighting conditions with large numbers as well as a small date window. The backlight function makes it easy to read the time in the dark.<br/>- Based on the brightness of the backlight when I activated the watch (simple step of removing a very small piece of plastic and pushing the stem closed) the watch battery appears fully charge<br/><br/>Cons<br/>- At this time (only 1 week) I see no faults.<br/><br/>Only “time” will tell how it holds up over the long run but at this juncture I’m very satisfied with this purchase.</span>

<span>I have 2 other perfectly good watches 1 a 15 year old Fossil analog Chrono and 1 5 year old Seiko analog  Chrono (both weigh a ton) but wanted to go digital for an everyday knock around watch. I looked around and decided to give this Timex Expedition a try and I'm glad I did. Most important thing the price was right, I liked the look and size it's so lightweight forget it's there. The Blackout display does take some getting used to but so does a new pair of glasses, the Indiglo works perfect night or day.

<span>*** Update 5/2/13*** It is a pleasure to report that it has been almost 4.5 years and this product is still working flawlessly. I used it on a 5.5 mile run and it is as good as the day I got it. See comments to this review -- others have made good tips that I agree with. The bottom line -- if you are still using it after this amount of time, you are either ready for an upgrade or at least won't mind having to buy another unit!<br/><br/>Original Review:<br/><br/>I'd hoped that getting this new running gadget would encourage me to exercise more often. So far so good. I asked for this for Christmas and, well, it has accomplished it's primary function for me... I've been running almost every day since I got it. I was turned off by the gigantic size of some HRMs, and did not need something to keep track of splits as I run on my treadmill at home and the gym.<br/><br/>As a heart rate monitor, the functionality is pleasantly simple. It tracks your heart rate for the whole workout. You hit the big button to start, and it goes to work tracking the length of time, the average heartbeat, and the peak. While you are running, it displays your current heartbeat. That's it -- but sometimes it's better to keep it simple.<br/><br/>I should point out that, as a watch, the watch piece tells the time and date only. If you want/need splits and a stopwatch, you should look elsewhere.<br/><br/>Here's some other thoughts: I was worried that the strap would break but realized after a couple workouts that I was probably wearing it a little too tight. Since adjusting, it is much more comfortable, has not fallen off, and, as a guy, you *almost* forget that you have it on. My wife cracked up when I took my shirt off after a recent workout. She said that, from the back, it looked like I was wearing a bra (or Manzierre, or Bro, if you prefer).<br/><br/>I had no original intention of wearing it while NOT working out, but I've found it addictive, and have enjoyed observing how drinking a cup of coffee while sitting at my desk does raise my heart rate about 10-15 beats per minute on average. Also, as I've started to get in a little better shape over the last 3 weeks, I see that I have to run either farther or faster to get my heart rate up to certain thresholds. And, now my heart rate does not go up as high from merely climing the stairs at home. I believe that these insights, among others, are very encouraging for someone who is just getting back in shape. The encouragement aspect combined with the simplicity makes this a great starter heart rate monitor for anyone considering.</span>

<span>I'm gotten a bit of an obsession with Field watches the past few years.  This one is a great design with a nice balance across the case/corners/bezel, great viewability on the face/numbers, great viewability of the date (somewhere that many field watches skimp -- assuming you want the date, of course).  On top of that, its ecodrive so you never have to change the battery when you're wearing it.  I do have to say, I've had a mixed bag of experience with ecodrive lately with a couple batteries dying if they weren't kept charged.  That's an expensive problem and something to consider if you tend to throw your watches in a drawer when not wearing them.  You must either wear an ecodrive, or leave it somewhere that it gets regular charging light.  But once you account for the management aspect, I'm a fan of ecodrive and this watch in particular.  You can spend a LOT more on a field watch but there's few that will actually look or perform better than this one.<br/><br/>After wearing this watch awhile I'm disappointed with the durability of the crystal which scratches easier than other Citizens. -1 star.</span>
