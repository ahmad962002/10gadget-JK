<span>These comments apply to Beats Flex released in late 2020.<br/><br/>I got this item to replace a set I bought in  early 2020 from another store. That set was great, but the left bud housing cracked when I fell asleep while wearing them. Besides that lack of durability and phone call quality, I liked the original product enough to repurchase it (at a sale price). Even so, I have some issues with the new set. My impressions are below.<br/><br/>Connectivity: These Flex does not connect as easily to my phone nor remain connected as reliably for listening (see the phone audio quality comments below). I use these Flex with the same phone as before, but the performance aspect of the new Flex is not as good. I believe that the Android Bluetooth settings and the Beats app (Android) interact differently with the new Flex. Where the older Flex seemed to connect quickly, these new Flex require different user actions. Finally, on this point, I have not linked these to my Macbook; however, my old Flex worked flawlessly--and sounded great with the Macbook.<br/><br/>Sound quality: These Flex sound good, but the bass is a bit wanting. I prefer a prominent low-end response, and the low-end on the Flex does not sound as good as the previous set. The highs and mid-range are clear, crisp, and not harsh or too bright, even at higher listening levels. I have not listened to Apple Spatial Audio content. The Dolby Atmos feature sounds about the same compared to the older Flex.<br/><br/>Phone audio quality: These Flex sound great and are superior to the quality of my older Flex. The difference is dramatic. The connection during phone use is stable and quiet with little noise.<br/><br/>Comfort: These Flex are less comfortable because the cord between the buds seems shorter or less flexible. I haven't concluded yet. The ear tips also seem harder and do feel as comfortable. If I find my broken set,  I will swap tips. My initial perceptions of (dis)comfort may be due to insufficient break-in time. If I determine this is the case, I will update this point.<br/><br/>Battery performance: The new Flex provide long listening time. I have frequently gotten more than 12<br/>ours of non-continuous use between charges. I am pleased by the battery performance.<br/><br/>Other features/Accessories: Flex comes with an assortment of 4 different-sized eartips and a USB-C to USB-C cable for charging Flex. The cable is much too short for my use, being only about 4-6 inches in length. I have not used the cable because it is inconvenient, and I do not own a USB-C charging adapter; however, I have a suitable adapter supplied with my phone. In the box, as they say, should be a longer cable and an appropriate adapter.</span>

<span>I have had these for about a year now and unlike my many other pairs of earbuds from other companies these have lasted and still work! Battery life is decent as well. After a year I charge them every other day or so and if I use them constantly all day I will have to do it daily.  They don’t have the quality of sound that my over the ear phones do with noise cancellation, but they are decent. I use them mostly for work meetings and listening to books/podcasts so the bass and music isn’t a priority. If it is for you these are OK. I am really glad I bought them since they’ve lasted this long.</span>

<span>Cheap for what you get, however for those of you with past experience wih Airpods will b disappointed. It's always a few minutes to get these up an running after setup. buttons are too small. So if it' no working and on your neck you just can' feel for the switch. Complete disaster in terms of running with them. Battery life is decent. Price is good but expect a headache on the setup an daily use is discourged by the headache of turning them on and gettting them up an runningg. i absollutely hated them for the firs weeek. Sm slowly warming up to them.</span>

<span>I purchased these to use when running and riding my mountain bike.  I've had zero issues with them and I'm quite impressed with the battery life.  The sound quality seems excellent to me, an average person with no musical skills.  My ONLY complaint is the charging cable, which is kind of a big deal and caused it to lose a star.  It would be nice if it were the standard USB connection instead of this weird thing that it is.  I can only plug in to charge if I have my laptop with me.  This is a huge annoyance since I also have no technical skills and don't know the first thing about what kind of adapter I might need.</span>

Bose Sport Earbuds are designed to energize your exercise with acclaimed lifelike sound and a comfortable secure fit. Get ready to beat your personal best, again and again. Bose patented acoustic port design and premium, high-efficiency drivers combine to deliver big sound from a small acoustic package. Bose signature Volume-Optimized Active EQ automatically adjusts the bass, midrange, and treble based on how loud or soft you play your music. And Bose new StayHear Max tips create an airtight seal with your ear canal — critical for hearing the deep low notes that add impact and emotion to your music and for blocking the ambient noise around you so you can focus on your music and your workout. Bose Sport Earbuds come with three sizes of StayHear Max tips, so you can find the right fit for you. Every surface that touches your ear is made of soft silicone. Meanwhile, the unique umbrella-shaped tip and the extended flexible wing keep your Bose Sport Earbuds securely in place — without need of an ear hook — no matter how much you shake your head or jump up and down.Bose Sport Earbuds go through rigorous quality testing for durability. They’re also rated IPX4 for water resistance, which means they’re protected against sweat and light rain. The electronics inside are wrapped in special materials that protect them from moisture, so your earbuds stay in top shape, just like you. Bose Sport Earbuds feature a capacitive touch interface. On the right Earbud, tap to play or pause music and to answer calls. And on the left Earbud, double-tap to engage a Shortcut function of your choice like checking your battery level. If you get a phone call, instead of interrupting your workout, simply tap the right Earbud or press and hold it to reject. If you answer, you’ll hear the call clearly in both ears. Meanwhile, your caller will hear you clearly, too — thanks to the beam forming microphone array that separates your voice from surrounding noise.Bose Sport Earbuds provide up to 5 hours of battery life per charge. They’re charged by placing them in the included charging case. If the case is charged, it will automatically charge the earbuds. The status lights on each Earbud will pulse white, while they charge before turning solid white and then off when fully charged. When the case is fully charged, it can provide a 15-minute quick charge for up to 2 more hours or two full charges for up to 10 more hours.Bose Sport Earbuds offer complete freedom of movement. As long as you’re within 30 feet (9 meters) of your device, you’ll hear whatever you’re playing. And with Bose custom-designed antennas hidden inside each Earbud, dropouts are rare.Bose Sport Earbuds connect to the free Bose Music app, which lets you name your earbuds, set the controls the way you like them, check your battery, and more.

<span>I own Bose QC 35 wireless II headphones, and the Soundsport Wireless Free earbuds. Both pair simultaneously with with my smartphone and tablet through the Bose Connect app, so I rarely have to worry about connecting/disconnecting a device. My Soundsport Free’s battery finally died after two years. They are great earbuds...great fit, sound. So it was natural to order the new Bose Sport earbuds to replace them.<br/><br/>To my surprise, the new Sports required that I use the new “better” Bose Music app. Whatever it’s mysterious advantages, the new app will only connect the earbuds to one device at a time, so I have to swap the connection every time I switch between my smartphone and tablet. This is better? And I have to use two different apps for two Bluetooth wireless headphones from the same manufacturer? Makes no sense. Bose...it’s simple. One app that can control all your Bose wireless products...like Sonos. Really your current approach makes you look very second tier from a software perspective. Get with the program.<br/><br/>The Bose Sport earbuds don’t fit quite as well as the Soundsport Frees for me. I use the midsize tips, and they look to be the same size on both but on the Sports the material is a little stiffer and more grippy (intentional I’m sure), but this makes them have more pressure against the ear which is a little less comfortable than the Soundsports, but I don’t notice after a while and they are still comfortable, just not AS comfortable. All depends on your ears though, and they are light and will never fall out, and a great design overall IMHO.<br/><br/>The controls operate through touchpads on each earphone. People rightfully complained that there were no volume controls, but they added it to right earbud through a software update and it’s hit or miss but works okay when running, though very imprecise. The overall limited controls...no ability to skip back a track, but can skip forward, doesn’t really bother me, but maybe it does others. Overall I think the approach is to have fairly simple controls on the earbuds that you can operate without searching for a little button. I think it works overall, and once you get used to it you can execute basic controls without breaking a step - but you’ll still “miss” a lot. Oh...and a  feature where if you take out the right earbud the music stops is actually very useful..a feature I can say really makes things easier for a runner like me seeing people I know on the street.<br/><br/>The sound is excellent, clean and deep bass (not “tight” or punchy) but accurate, with a wide soundstage with clear highs that you can play loud without hurting your ears. The sound doesn’t hit you up we the head with anything...just tries to present the whole picture accurately, and does this very well.<br/><br/>The phone capability is okay. Fine. No better than the Soundsport Free. Sometimes people can hear me and sometimes they can’t. Blech.<br/><br/>I’ve considered returning them, but for my use...mostly for running, working out and walking, they work well. Still pretty comfortable, very secure, good sound. Case is small enough for my needs but not svelte as many prefer. Battery life doesn’t compete well with competitors. There’s no reason Bose could not have added more charging hours in the larger case. What a miss competitively. But for me, 15 hours from a fully charged case and earbuds is plenty. There’s no noise cancellation...but I want to hear the cars coming. Not a need for me for this device.<br/><br/>The software thing really grates though. They need to add multipoint connectivity for this device via the app, and allow older devices to use the new Bose Music app. Like soon. They also should add some equalizer capability on the app.<br/><br/>Another weird thing. The bluetooth connectivity button is on the case, not the earbuds. Probably a way to make the earbudy ligher or simpler. BUT, as happened to me, if you go out or on a run and the earbuds are not connected to your device, there is no way to connect them without the case. I did the software update which disconnected them, then went on a run and by the time I realized this I was a half mile away and had to go without. Annoying. Im not sure what advantage this confers to the consumer. Maybe that's why the case is larger and doesnt have more battery supply. Who knows? I wish manufacturers would explain why they do things like this.<br/><br/>From a competitive feature standpoint, these earbuds don’t compare well with, say, Jabras, but if you appreciate the sound and comfortable, secure fit, you might end up preferring them anyway, especially as new software updates come out (I hope).</span>

<span>Let me first start off by saying I’m not a audiophile per say but I do know and I appreciate a good quality sounding pair of earbuds or headphones. Bose never disappoints when it comes to sound quality as far as I’m concerned. I’ve owned may Bose brand audio equipment and all of them have been top tier in that category. These are no different. Bose even included a custom EQ setting in their app software which is absolutely fantastic. Many other earbuds don’t give you that kind of customization. The build quality is also very nice as well. The only downfall these ear buds have going against them is the pitiful battery life. The manual says you’ll get 5 hours of run time. I have not once even come close to that. At 50%-60% volume (which is usually the levels I listen to music at) I normally get 3-4 maximum, hours of runtime before the battery goes into the red (20% or lower). This is very unacceptable in my opinion especially in this modern age of battery technology and advancement. I understand that when the EQ is enabled and you are running a custom sound profile that also eats away at the battery life. However Bose leave’s much to be desired when it comes to the battery life. I’m confident with a software update they can remedy this. Even with the sub par battery life I would still recommend these earbuds given the amazing sound quality and build quality. They hold up nicely when working out and I am not afraid of breaking them or causing damage when doing strenuous activities. If you are like me and appreciate and desire the best sound quality from a pair of earbuds, I’m sure you’ll be very happy with your purchase if you choose too.</span>

<span>Purchased these when I was in the market for new headphones and can't believe I didn't have them sooner. I previously had airpods before I ran over the right earbud and the left earbud eventually stopped working. The sound is immaculate and pretty comfortable. My only complaint would be the black bar that's meant to hold the bud in your ear tends to hurt after an extensive amount of time (5+ hours). Aside from that, I'm able to workout, run, even dance around and they won't budge. I've always known Bose to be a top tier sound output (along with Sony and BeatsbyDre) but they were on promo and I couldn't beat the price.<br/><br/>Love music? Get these. Love blocked out noise? Get these. Don't mind a little discomfort with phenomenal sound? Get THESE.</span>

<span>So I really like these headphones. They are comfortable, the sound is great. But after a few uses the charging contacts don't work as well. The smallest vibration causes the to lose contact and quit charging. There have been many time i have left them "charging" over night only to have them give me a low battery warning 10 minutes into use. For this reason I will be looking for a new set.</span>

<span>I won't lie, I was VERY skeptical of these earbuds. As someone who usually goes all out with electronics, I got these because they were cheap and looked really cute, and I didn't think they'd be all that great. I was WRONG.<br/>I never expected them to exceed my expectations so heavily. The sound quality is great, the noise cancellation is AMAZING, and they're very comfortable.<br/><br/>Sound quality: The bass really hits, the vocals sound incredible, and the volume is great. It's the tiniest bit airy, but the sound quality is definitely better than my Skullcandy Hesh 2's, and those cost me at least triple when they'd first came out.<br/><br/>Noise cancellation: As someone with sensory issues/environmental overstimulation, it's hard to find something that blocks out sound while feeling light &amp; comfortable. These are all of the above! When I'm not listening to anything, it blocks out most sounds and noises, minus maybe loud talking or the TV. When I'm listening to music, there's no noise whatsoever. I can't even hear my boyfriend if he's shouting in the same room as me (which he only does to get my attention since now I can't hear him with them in haha).<br/><br/>Microphone quality: Not great at all, I won't lie. But, I doubt anyone would be buying these for the microphone capabilities outside of maybe taking calls. They're good enough to take calls, but not much else.<br/><br/>Battery life: For the price, the battery life is great. 3-4 hours of consistent use and you can put them back in the charging case for 45 minutes for another 3-4 hours. The case charges fully in about 5 hours, so I charge it overnight &amp; it's great for everyday listening. I use these when I'm cleaning around the house, riding my bike, cooking, and for gaming at my PC as well. The battery lasts through all of it, and if you're inactive they'll enter power saving mode as well.<br/><br/>Aesthetics: These remind me a lot of Beats earbuds. But, I genuinely prefer the looks of these. They're bright &amp; fun, the Skullcandy logo is cute &amp; minimal. The charging case is cute, but when the earbuds are out the two slots are open, so I might opt for getting an extra case around them. The case is about the size of a car key remote, and it can fit nicely on any keychain or lanyards.<br/><br/>Overall, I'm EXTREMELY happy with these earbuds so far. Definitely the best bang for your buck, and maybe even better than some of the $50 earbuds I've tested.<br/><br/>They're great. If your intuition is telling you to get them, do it. You won't regret it, and if you do, there's a one year warranty.</span>

<span>These earbuds are great, they feel smooth and the case is sturdy and comes with a little keyring attatchment which is great for people who don't want to put the case in their pockets or bag.<br/>The extra ear tips are also good quality and necessary for good sound cancellation!<br/>Like most Skullcandy earbuds these are quite bass-y which depending on who you are is either really good or really bad... personally I don't like it so if you are like me then I recommend installing an equalizer and playing around with it until you get the perfect sound.</span>

<span>The earbud were easy to pair,<br/>sound great, could be slighly louder. Charging cable (only 4 inches long)! Would only work plugged into a power strip on the floor, or plugged into the side of my laptop (All USB ports being are already used for peripherals). The other option was letting it dangle several inches from the floor which would eventually destroy the cable and put stress on the charging port. Be ready to buy a longer cable of decent length if you buy this product unless you're using a power strip on the ground or usb port of laptop. I wish the manufacturers of these kind of products would spend the extra few pennies to make the cords longer! If the sound quality hadn't been so good I would have returned these for a refund!</span>

<span>I wanted to write a review that was as non biased as possible. I own a pair of AirPods Pro’s. I bought these beats for my job, where it can be it very loud. I didn’t want to run the risk of losing my AirPods. I saw the beats were on sale.<br/><br/>I like them a lot, for it to be a cheaper alternative for AirPod pros. The noise cancellation isn’t as good as the AirPod pros. In my opinion it’s not that much of a difference between the two. It’s noticeable difference but not an inconvenience either.<br/><br/>With either ANC or Transparency mood is on. The beats sacrifice some of the audio performance for either one. Sounds the same in either mood. When you turn noise control off, the bass, treble, and etc are amplified. For the AirPod pros it’s the complete opposite from the beats in terms of noise control. The bass is amplified in ANC or transparency mood; and sacrifices the audio performance with noise control off. Make sure to figure out what ear tips fit best in your ear to get the best quality.<br/><br/>To me they’re worth 89-110 dollars, I wouldn’t pay anything over it. Especially not at 150, but it’s a great quality for that price range I set if you can find it on sale. Whereas I’d pay full price for the Pros, and did.<br/><br/>All in all they’re a good quality pair of ear buds to get the job done. They’re a good cheaper alternative to AirPod pros. Would still serve as a great gift or to satisfy the average everydays needs.</span>

<span>This is the first set of earbuds that actually stay in my ear with my piercings. I have a big conch piercing as well as both tragus and I have tried to shake the buds out. They're not budging and I don't have to constantly readjust them. This alone is enough for me to give it 5 stars.<br/><br/>I am super impressed with the sound quality. Listening to O Fortuna was an epic experience. Noise cancellation provides for a great isolating experience and transparency is a welcomed option as well. Listening while being aware of your surroundings is always important and these do the job as long as you don't raise music level above maybe 75%.  I haven't had it long enough to know how good the battery life is so I can't really speculate on that just yet but the ease of pairing actually shocked me.<br/><br/>I will say I'm not that fond of the casing. It feels a tad flimsy and it doesn't handle well. It is that type of material that could easily slip from your hand so I highly suggest a silicone case cover. Also, fitting the buds into the case is almost like playing Tetris to me. Figuring out the orientation it should go in as well as trying to get a good grip on it to remove it from the case can be somehow daunting.<br/><br/>Overall I am very pleased with this purchase. It was on sale for $89 so this was a steal for such a great product.</span>

<span>These are amazing. So much I had to order a second pair for my wife. I’ve moved to other brands, until I just lost one of the earbud. I was skeptical because they’re only 99$. That said, you will be amazed at how simple these bids are to operate. Long hold to activate noise cancellation. The color selection and the features you think would price these much higher. My first purchase was the blue, then the second pair was gray.  The rich bass comes right in the ear. You can hear the bass thumping, which I need when working out.  I like the feel and the ability to place the buds in my ear using the handles. The noise cancellation worked just as good as other headphones I’ve had. The fast delivery was great since I had to give up the first pair. Now my son wants his pair. Great product!!</span>

<span>For $99.99, I’ve bought it without thinking it twice. I have the headphones and thought it’ll be the same with the buds.<br/>Though it’s slightly different<br/>-the sound quality is lower<br/>-the case itself is plastic.<br/>However, this has a lot of potential!<br/>-unlike the apple with a touch is sensitive it’s a button that’s on the earbuds and you can click for different commands.<br/>-for me doesn’t hurt for having the buds in for a along time and has various sizes for the buds if it doesn’t fit your ear. ( I’d say about two different sets in the package)<br/>When the battery is low ( which lasts 8 hrs) a sound tells you in advance around 15%.<br/>If you take one earphone out while the other is on, it’ll keep on playing music or videos.<br/>I had no problem with the pairing.<br/>Also, in the setting of the beats, there is an option for noise cancellation or ambient. Which is pretty amazing! The noise cancellation is the best.<br/>The charger is really short in length. It’s a type C. So I recommend getting a longer charger if you want to.<br/>Overall, it’s a great buy! Though you do need to get a case cover for this because it feels fragile with the plastic case it has.</span>

<span>Overall these earbuds met my expectations. Great sound quality, great battery life, small compact sturdy carrying case, smooth connection, fit comfortably for long periods of time. Personally I really like that the side control buttons on the earbuds are physical buttons rather than touch controls.<br/><br/>With the side control buttons you can perform the following actions:<br/>Next Song - 1 press left<br/>Previous  - 2 press left<br/>play/pause - 1 press right<br/>accept/end call - 1 press right<br/>siri/google assist/bixby - 2 press right<br/>You can also just use only the right or left earbud in mono mode and then 1 press will be play/pause and 2 press siri...<br/><br/>Cons<br/>These earbuds are not on the list of supported devices for the JBL headphones app so you won't be able to do any EQ customization or personalization.<br/><br/>There are no way to change volume with the buttons which would have been nice to see. The one time I've found this to be a headache is when using the earbuds with my Samsung smart tv which didn't allow me to change the volume of the earbuds from the remote or settings. Unfortunately there doesn't seem to be way around this because these earbuds are not supported on their app.</span>

<span>The noise cancellation was not great. The sound quality was good and the battery life was excellent. The sound when you are playing music is very good, but when they are being used for phone calls, it can be a little choppy and fade out. For phone calls I don’t really recommend them but for music I would definitely recommend!! They are the first ones that I bought and I was happy with them. What I like is the price is not that  expensive and they perform well. I am glad that they are not so expensive like the other brands out there.</span>

<span>These have some incredible battery life. Also the sound is excellent. Sometimes i do wish the sound would be louder to hear voices on movies, but it defintiely is sufficient. I like the different sizes that comes with to fit your ear properly and that the headphones magnetically snap into place in the case. Best part? They dont fall off when working out - Earbuds without fail always fall out when I'm at the gym - these don't! Some of the other reviews do have credence when they say your ear gets sore when wearing them for long periods of time. I find this to be true, but what pair of headphones does this not happen with? Honestly, these headphones are great - im very happy with my purchase.</span>

<span>Quality of sound is really good, it’s very comfortable, it worth! Cause is not too big how I imagined! The only three things I can complain is about there is no noise cancellation as AirPods Pro, the volume is not loud as airpods and if you’re listening any song, if you change the tab, the sound fails for a few seconds!  it's pretty annoying! if AirPods had a way to hold them in the ears, it would be the perfect and ideal earphone!  much better than powerbeats!</span>

<span>I have had my Powerbeats Pro for about a week now and after a bit of a rocky start and an adjustment period, I find them to be almost perfect headphones. When I first put them on, I was wildly disappointed. They were uncomfortable and sounded tinny with no bass at all. I genuinely believed I would be returning them and getting second gen Air Pods instead. But, given how excited I was for the Powerebeats Pro to come out and the cost, I decided to put in a little effort and give them a chance. It wasn't until about 3 or 4 days in that I decided to keep them.<br/><br/>So, if  you are like me and think your new Powerbeats Pro sound like garbage when you first put them on and you wonder if all the positive reviewers are high, experiment with all the tips before dismissing the headphones as crap. In-ear buds need a good seal to sound good. I have freakishly small ears so I always start with the smallest tip available when trying out new headphones which usually works for me. Not this time. It sounded awful and I was briefly outraged that I had paid $250 for garbage. It was counter-intuitive, but I finally tried the biggest tips instead which gave me a good seal and let me wear the headphones without having to go as deep into my ears which made them more comfortable too. Once I found the right fit with a good seal, I discovered that yes, in fact, these things do actually have some nice ear-thumping bass. I think the bass is better than original Air Pods but also not overwhelming as Beats products have a reputation for being. It's satisfyingly skull shaking without being distorted and is balanced out nicely by clear highs. I'm not an audiophile by any means, but I won't listen to any old crap either. I like a little bass and good clarity and the Powerbeats Pro deliver.<br/><br/>My biggest issue with these is comfort. As I mentioned, I have freakishly small ears and while I have been using Air Pods for a couple years, I was doing so with discomfort. I put up with a little paind because of the convenience of function. I love the automatic connection, the ability to use one bud at a time and charging on the go in the case. So, when I first read about the Powerbeats Pro, I was expecting something that would have the convenience of Air Pods with better comfort and something that wouldn't fall out of my ears all the time. Generally, I do okay with headphones that have different sizes of silicone tips so I was expecting the Powerbeats Pro to be a comfort upgrade. Initially, they actually hurt my ears more than Air Pods, especially my right ear. I fully blame this on my freakishly small ears. I'm one of those people who often finds "one size fits all" to be laughably ridiculous. Again, I was determined to love these things so I tinkered a bit to find an acceptable level of discomfort. The largest tip allows me to get a good seal without having to put them in so deep, relieving some pressure and cutting down on pain. When I first tried them, I could only last about 20 minutes before the pain forced me to take them out. After adjusting to find a good angle and replacing the silicone tips with Comply Sport tips, I'm a lot more comfortable and can last 2 or 3 hours before I feel discomfort. Even then, I would call it discomfort and not outright pain. It's discomfort I can live with and not any worse than what I experience with Air Pods. Also, my discomfort is only in my right ear instead of both like I get with Air Pods. Since I go with one bud a lot of the time, I'll just use the left one. No biggie. I can't blame the manufacturer for my tiny ears which is why I'm not taking away a star.<br/><br/>On the plus side, the fit is very secure. I have worked out in them several times and they don't budge. I never could work out in Air Pods because they fell out all the time. I can also wear these while laying down which I couldn't do in Air Pods without them falling out periodically. Also, the connection is great. Original Air Pods used to randomly lose connection or not connect when they were supposed to. The chip upgrade in the Powerbeats Pro seems to have resolved this little annoyance. They connect faster and after a week, I haven't experienced a drop or glitch once.<br/><br/>The Powerbeats Pro do come with a tradeoff when it comes to the size of the case. If you are used to carrying around Air Pods in your pocket in their tiny case, forget about it with Powerbeats Pro. The case is significantly larger. It goes in a bag or purse without taking up a ton of room but it's too big to fit comfortably in a pocket. The extra battery life for Powerbeats is nice though. I frequently use one bud at a time and used to drain an Air Pod and have to switch ears regularly. I'm using the Powerbeats Pro the same way and haven't drained a bud yet. I'm okay with the bigger case since the better battery life makes me feel secure about leaving the case at home when I need to go bagless.<br/><br/>So in summary, these are the best sounding buds I have used. They are super convenient, easy to connect and won't fall out of your ears. If you have normal human sized ears, they will probably be comfortable and the battery life is great. You have to deal with a bigger case but the positive improvements over Air Pods make the size trade-off worth it. If you don't hear the bass, try different tips and twist them around a bit before you give up. Hopefully you won't have to work as hard at it as I did to find your happy place with Powerbeats Pro but the effort has been worth it. These are really great headphones and worth the price.</span>

<span>I did not have a good experience with a previous Jabra bud.  In 2018 I purchased the Elite Active 75t, initially it performed as expected and served the purpose for what it was intended.  I ran into an issue at 13 months following a firmware upgrade to Sound+ that was supposed to have added ANC to the unit.  Shortly thereafter I began experiencing loss of audio volume in the left bud.  Did the typical troubleshooting recommended by Jabra without success.  I filed a warranty request and was sent a replacement, a refurbed product it turns out, and again initially did what it is supposed to do.  At 7 months the exact same issue recurred the only exception being it was the right bud this time around.  No resolution from Jabra support nor able to find a fix after scouring internet forums and warranty was no longer valid for the replacement pair which would have cost me $99. Not into throwing good money after bad so NO.  This is a common problem apparently and continues to be for the 65t and 75t Active series so I was very reluctant to give Jabra another go.  But here I am and in this case trying out the Elite 7 Active.  After 30 of hours of use I'm satisfied but time will tell so the jury is out on this one.  It's only fair to mention the extraordinary sound quality of the 7 Active, the ability to fine tune precisely the users listening preferences via preset and custom settings, the superb fit, ANC performance, and configurability of the buds making phone calls as well as the crisp button touches toggling through the menu functions.  I have tried many other brands, Bose, Sony, Samsung Galaxy, (I don't worship at the Apple altar), etc. hoping to find the perfect listening experience and the Jabra buds are the best of the bunch by at least a full length.  I'm unsure what to expect with the history of Elite Active technical problems so it's wait and see, I remain hopeful Jabra has fixed this once and for all.</span>

<span>Update 10/06/2022:<br/><br/>Me again... well, it happened again! (it's becoming a tradition xD )... for 2 straight weeks i haven't charged the case (because i forgot!) and my question is: WHY this thing last so long? it's kinda "awkward" because i'm not use to things last in terms of battery life!... send help! xD but for real now, i didn't expect to have 52% on battery on the case and 100% on the earpieces!<br/><br/>I saw some new reviews again, and seriously, how is it possible that they receive (potentially) defective devices? (if you can call it that)... i'm presuming that they're operating it in the wrong way (i guess?). Oh and i almost forgot: i started using it more on android with a Samsung A53 5G... weirdly enough, the sound quality improved! middle-lows and middle-highs are more noticeable and balanced for me! Well i also gotta admit that i used my airpods on my iphone kinda regularly because as you everyone knows (even better than me) that is HARD to move from one phone to another (including personal data, banking, etc.) specially if both phones are from different OSes....<br/><br/>Anywho anyhow... the point of this update is: WOW! get it NOW!... with every track it feels warm and cozy. i love it!<br/><br/>ORIGINAL:<br/>Well, my journey with Jabra started with https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B005FVNHBI this one that i bought back in 2011, they lasted 3 or 4 years until one of the earpiece sides broke because of too much sweat? i don't know but i regret the day i couldn't use it anymore because it had such a good sound that made me feel that i was at a nightclub... Then i found these little guys and to be completely honest i was kinda hesitant to buy it then i've got it... all fear were gone in a matter of minutes! i've downloaded the app for android and iphone to test it on both and man... just beyond everything i've expected!<br/><br/>Battery, sound, isolation... it's everything i've ever wanted on a headset! i mean, it doesn't fit in my mind how it's possible that such a good product can be on this price range!<br/><br/>I've read some of the 1 and 3 star reviews and i haven't had a single issue with them.... when i first paired them to my devices i couldn't get them to work both sides but then i put it on the case and take them out at the same time and problem solved!... People just hear me normally on calls, i hear them well as well... ambient isolation is SO GOOD that it reaches 98%, meaning that u hear the world almost nothing when u're listening music, and you don't need it to be too loud. I don't have it too loud because i've EQ'd the headset with the app and man... they're the best i've got! (apple airpods pro and regular ones are nothing next to these! i even regret not having knowledge of the existence of this item earlier).<br/><br/>So far i haven't found any single bad thing on it yet... as a matter of fact, last week i went to a long trip and i seriously forgot to charge the case and i felt truly sad because i forgot it XD but then i've opened the case and i saw the yellow light and when i've opened the app it showed 38% on the case and the earpieces 100%... imagine how my face lightened up! it truly made my trip...<br/><br/>people really need to follow up instructions.... and don't forget to download the app!</span>
