<blockquote><em><div class="a-row a-spacing-small review-data"><span class="a-size-base review-text review-text-content" data-hook="review-body">
<span>I'm the owner of a Flexpack Pro from Korin that I've had for a few years. It's started showing the wear and tear I've put on it and I was looking for a bit bigger of a bag anyways. I saw that Korin had released the Flippack Pro and thought it would be a great upgrade given its claimed 23L capacity versus the Flexpack Pro's claimed 18L capacity.<br/><br/>There is no way on God's green earth that this thing has 5L more capacity than the Flexpack Pro. To the contrary, it seems even smaller than that bag, so I have no idea how Korin is making their measurements. For reference, the Flippack is on the left and the Flexpack on the right.<br/><br/>Dont get me wrong, it's still a very nice backpack and there's a lot to like about it, I just haven't made up my mind about keeping it since it is not the upgrade I was looking for.<br/><br/>Update 9/26: after taking this bag on a weekend trip, I've decided to keep it. While the capacity is not as large as they claim, I did find I was able to fit slightly more into the Flippack than my old Flexpack due to the way they've redesigned the storage. I'll reiterate that there's no way this has 5L more capacity, but it can fit slightly more if you're packing tight for a flight and just want the one bag. I've also come to like the magnetic pockets on the side and the quick access it allows to items.<br/><br/>Also, pro tip: when I first got it, I thought there was no way of locking the main compartment, which was a huge disappointment over the Flexpack. I didn't see it anywhere in the advertising, but you can fit the locking clips for the laptop compartment through the zipper loops on the main compartment and then lock it all the same. I'm actually a huge fan of being able to lock either the laptop compartment or the whole bag, since sometimes I want quick access to the main compartment while still keeping my laptop secure.</span>

<span>I love this backpack! I bought this backpack for our trip to Europe last month. We needed something small but large enough and well organized to carry everything we would need for an entire day out and about doing various activities. We also required a pack that would lock, had external pouches for water/drinks, and designed to be weather resistant/proof.  I researched backpacks EXTENSIVELY!  This pack had it all. We were able to pack everything we needed in it including iPad, water, umbrella and jackets. The lock was invaluable. Very comfortable and light weight. We had no problems taking it with us on all of our excursions - many other people were not allowed to take their backpack in because of the size. We took it in: Eiffel Tower, Arc de Triumph, St. Mark’s Basilica and Doge’s Palace in Venice, Leaning Tower of Piza, Florence - Duomo, The Vatican and Coliseum. Whether you are planning a trip or just needing a lightweight, well organized backpack - this backpack is awesome!</span>

<span>Overall this backpack has been designed with high quality materials, a host of thoughtful features and plenty of storage!  On the exterior of the bag, the light gray material facing outward when worn, is made to resist scratches, tears and other type of abrasions.  Although I did not test the bag in rain or snow, I feel that it would hold up well.  The backpack is lightweight, comfortable and easily adjustable.<br/><br/>Under one of the shoulder straps, a USB port can be found and is easily accessible.  Through the interior of the bag, a wire connects the USB port to a portable power source (not included) of your choice.  Inside, a pocket with a battery symbol shows where the USB plug from the port can be connected to a power source.<br/><br/>On the other shoulder strap, inside a zippered compartment, a water bottle holder can unfold out.  Above the same strap, one will find a coiled cord that can be stretched out and secured around an object to prevent theft of the bag.  At the top of the backpack, the two main zippers can be placed into a configurable TSA lock to block inside access.  Behind both straps, on the back side of the bag, there is a hidden zippered compartment for added security.<br/><br/>When the bag is completely unzipped, it opens like a clam shell.  Due to its design, there is quite a bit of space inside.<br/>On one side, there is a laptop compartment, a tablet (or similar) compartment and zippered compartment for the portable power source and other small items.  On the other side of the bag, there are two removable zippered storage bags, two pockets underneath where the storage bags velcro onto, two pockets on the inside walls of the bag and a large open pocket with a built-in zippered pocket.<br/><br/>When opened, both removable storage bags have mesh pockets to quickly locate items, additional pockets and either a hook or carabiner.  Other amenities included are a rain guard that covers the entire backpack, and a small RFID bag to store item that one would like to be shielded.<br/><br/>Overall, I am happy with the backpack. It is the right size, lightweight, comfortable and has a number of the features that I wanted to satisfy both my business and personal needs.</span>

<span>Overall a good bag for travel - took it  everywhere in Scotland and  Ireland.  Loved locking zippers and the cable lock.  Straps needed frequent adjustment as they slipped in buckle even when bag was not heavy.  Roomy but things fall out easily - needs more pickets. Rain cover was super handy and the pouch for water bottle or umbrella is awesome.  Loved the external USB access as I took thousands of photos - wore my iPhone on a lanyard and plugged in so never out of power.  External pockets were good - don’t think the key holder is needed/would prefer more room without it in that pocket.  Price point is high even though is well made</span>

<span>I've used this backpack for a week now and can say it does punch above it's weight (pun intended).<br/><br/>It is decent quality although in person it looks just a little bit worse than the photos. It's well padded all around so you can be sure your gadgets are safe. The compartments are enough for my needs and are decent size. Two things I am missing is a waterbottle holder and a strap for sliding on top of a carry-on suitcase's handle.<br/><br/>The backpack itself is small and slim. My 15.6" lenovo y500 barely fits. and once you throw in a mouse, a charger and some boxed lunch there isn't much space left. That being said, the small profile makes it look clean and sexy.</span>

<span>Had this bag over a year! Holding up strong after almost daily use of back and forth to work. I don't carry a lot with me and was on the hunt for a backpack that wasn't obnoxiously big. This perfectly fits laptop, charger and mouse, plus room for extra items still. My 15" laptop fits perfect in it. Only thing I wish it had was more padding on the very bottom. There have been a few times where I set it down and worried that I broke something.</span>

<span>Great backpack for my daily commute from the burbs to downtown Chicago,  it arrived defective. The velcro on the strap that hold the computer in the padded compartment was fine, but the piece on the padding itself was only sewn in on 2 of the 4 sides of the velcro square.  I will probably sew it on myself because I do like the bag and it's less of a hassle than returning/repurchasing.  Just unfortunate to spend the money on something brand new and have it arrive in this conditiion.</span>

<blockquote><em><div class="a-row a-spacing-small review-data"><span class="a-size-base review-text review-text-content" data-hook="review-body">
<span>It's a decent backpack.<br/>Unfortunately, I fell for the largely artificial hype created by all the professional reviewers reviewing their free or discounted backpacks.<br/>Although it is discouraged, the fact remains that most of these supposedly top reviewers feel incentivised to give 5 star reviews to anything they get for free.<br/><br/>Here's an honest review. I paid for this item in full and felt that I needed to return it, here's why:<br/><br/>1: Minimalist is right! I realize that's just truth in advertising BUT it seems unfair to classify this as a college backpack. It's an elementary school backpack, at best. The size is enough to embarrass most male university students. It really feels fit for a hello kitty symbol somewhere, that's how tiny this thing is.<br/><br/>2. Not much padding at all for the bottom of the backpack. To be fair, this is what a lot of manufacturers continue to get wrong, but the fact remains that if you're going to advertise it as a laptop backpack, there ought to be a little bit of foam on the bottom to prevent damage to any precious cargo when you set your backpack down, as is a common use of backpacks.<br/><br/>3.The lining is paper thin polyester. Really, this part was astonishingly light weight. Your mileage may vary, though I know I wouldn't trust slipping any traditional binders in there for fear of a tear.<br/><br/>All in all, it'd be a fun little pack for a very, very casual user. That is all.</span>

<span>So, I LOVE this magical backpack. WHY? It manages to look sleek and slim at the same time as being truly capacious. ( What alchemy is this!?!?) Slim outside big inside, must be made of the same material as a tardis.<br/><br/>Seriously, I don't know how they managed to pull it off.  But this design it EXACTLY what I needed: it really matches both my 'fashionista' side and my "gotta bring it all with, because you never know...." side of my personality. With this bag, I can have both worlds: I look good and I don't need to worry about leaving essentials behind.<br/><br/>The design is also very practical. I love the sleek slide pockets. They are great for everything from carrying a coffee mug or water bottle.<br/><br/>Or, shout out to my painter/artist friends reading this: I've even packed several watercolor brushes in there and headed out for en plein aire painting. They stay snug to the side of the bag, but they don't get caught or bent. The pockets are designed perfectly: snug so that whatever you put in them is not going to fall out, but also they are 'open' on top ( no flaps or closures.) Which is what I prefer, perfect for art supplies.<br/><br/>It fits my 17Inch 2021 Macbook Pro beautifully, and has just the right number of divisions, without too many secret pockets where things can get lost. This bag is all about simple, beautiful design that is imminently practical and usable.<br/><br/>Look, I love a good bag, so I have a number of backpacks and shoulderbags. Did I really need another one? Hmmmmmmmm......... thinking....This is why I left this in my cart for a long time before buying it, but I wish I had grabbed it sooner. I've been thrilled with it from day one.  It has quickly replaced my former number one favorite to become my primary MacBook bag. If you like me are waiting to finally hit the buy it now button: just...buy it now. Just doooooo eeeet!</span>

<span>This backpack is very good looking with an excellent build quality -especially for the great price point.  It delivers on being super slim, fits and looks wonderful which is its greatest feature.  What was less than perfect were the pockets, specifically the access size at the zippers and any sort of organizational aides within the pockets. There are basically four pockets.<br/>1)Starting from the back, the touted secure "anit-theft" pocket is a great idea but hiding the zipper under the strap for hanging over a rollaboard handle just made it very hard to get access to it. You would keep your valuables there but not if you want easy access to it.<br/>2)The main and biggest pocket is great... nice padded-lined sleeve for up to a 15" laptop; my 2021 14" MacBook Pro was swimming in there.  Outside the sleeve, but still in the main pocket, interior pockets and pen holders were perfect, keeping all the miscellaneous items from piling up in a big bundle at the bottom -which is the biggest capacity/thickest part of this "slim" package.<br/>3)The mid-body pocket has nothing that helps organize anything you put in it so everything piles up at the bottom which is hard to access because there is only a top zipper (unlike the main compartment which has a nice wide zipper that lets you see into it.) so finding and getting to your stuff is poor.  Which is a shame because that's where I've had to put documents that I need quick access to (see why the front pocket doesn't work well next).<br/>4)The very front pocket has only a discrete side zipper and is a logical place for documents that you need quick access to. Unfortunately, the shortness of the zipper and lack of width of the compartment doesn't allow for Letter-sized documents to lie flat in there.  The compartment just needs a quarter inch more width and the zipper needs to open a quarter inch longer. Placement would be perfect but it's not to be... I have to fold documents in half or lose them in the large compartment. mixed in with cables and sunglasses and power supplies.<br/>The final comment is that I wore it all day yesterday with my 3.5 lb laptop, with 0.5lb power supply and cables and maybe another .5lb of pens, business cards...  Good news, it looked great and stayed "slim", bad news, it was very cumbersome to find and get access to stuff -after a couple of hours and the rest of the day, the straps felt uncomfortable for the light weight that I was carrying.  I guess it's really a commuter's bag and not that suitable for day trips.</span>

Last year it was such a hassle trying to fit all his school books and heavy school laptop in his backpack, making it really hard for him to carry as he's smaller for his age. So this year we wanted something easier for him to carry. The school is now requiring him to use a zippered binder this year, which doesn't fit his laptop. And we couldn't find a zippered binder that was big enough for his laptop. We did however, discovered a lightweight zippered binder with a shoulder strap that fits all his notebooks and stuff, and we found this backpack for his laptop. Combined together, it is so much easier for him to carry them both and he isn't struggling so much with a heavy backpack now.<br/><br/>The laptop backpack itself is really well put together. For the price, you really can't go wrong. It's lightweight, thin, fits his 15" laptop perfectly without being heavy. The straps are easily adjustable, and he can sit on the bus seats without having to take it off and put it on again. He can just wear it and carry his zippered binder in his lap.<br/><br/>Personally, I like the bag so much I may order one for myself so I can take my writing with me when I leave the house.</span>

<span>I ordered this bag in pinch when my 16" MacBook Pro wouldn't fit in my new suitcase. I needed bag that I could carry my tech in and this bag was just want I was looking for.  It is light weight and well made.  the laptop compartment holds my laptop securely. I can't accurately assess whether or not it is comfortable to carry for long periods of time on your back.  I have a shoulder and back condition that won't allow me to carry a backpack on both shoulders.  What I can say is, that when I carried this bag on one shoulder for a brief period of time it was very comfortable.<br/><br/>A possible limitation of this bag is that a magnet holds the flap secure for the laptop compartment.  It works very well and feels very secure.  It doesn't feel like the flap will come loose.  However, zippers would be more secure in the long run if one needs to travel on planes.<br/>The compartment that holds your accessories is spacious, and well made. The compartment closes with a zipper that sturdy and secure.  If you need a bag that carries your clothes, or books, or other stuff and a laptop this bag is not for you.  If you're looking for a bag just for your laptop, tablet,  and other tech accessories, then I highly recommend this bag.<br/>I am very happy with this bag and would not hesitate to order it again.</span>

<span>I have had so many compliments on the look of this backpack. Thin, sturdy, classy and light. It easily accommodates my<br/>2021 16.2 inch Macbook pro and it could easily accommodate another 13 inch  laptop or tablet as well. The top part also has room for items (see photo)<br/><br/>This pack is so thin and light, yet can hold a lot of items: so due to the supply chain issues, I bought another one. Seriously folks I am very critical about things, but this backpack is one of those once in 10 year purchases where everything about this product is perfect. I highly recommend this backpack and be prepared for the compliments: it looks really well built and professional.</span>

<span>The design is good, especially for people who have a laptop to carry. It is very easy to fit things in the bag. If I have to point one disadvantage, it will be the volume. Because it has too many layers, so the space in each layer may not be as large as you think.</span>

<span>I bought this for my husband for travel.  It's not huge, but it can really hold quite a bit.  Having the separate zippers makes organizing easy.  The front zipper pocket also folds down for easy access.  He didn't use the power cord yet.  Our flights were only a few hours long.  It's very well made, has the strap to slip over a suitcase handle.  I haven't checked to see if you can add a lock to the zippers.  That would be handy for walking in crowds or crowded trains.  I recommend!</span>

<span>I have been using this backpack for 8 months, and I can say it is my favorite one yet. I carry it everywhere with basically everything you need to survive a nuke inside. It has held up better than any thus far, and I can be rough with some of the things I own. I like the fact that I am able to charge my devices without open the bag with a simple battery pack stored inside and fed through the outer charge port.</span>

<span>Wanted to give my input on this bag. I had been using a Targus backpack for several years. On a recent flight, the zipper got caught in the web part of the magazine holder. When I grabbed my bag, it pulled the zipper off. It had been a diehard bag for many years. I began to do my research and looked at Targus, Swissgear, Samsonite, and others. Based on my particular needs, I landed on this backpack. Great room for my MacBook Pro. Plenty of space for other things. Padded nicely. I needed a handle I could grab and go without worrying about breaking. So far, so good. I needed zippers I could trust because I also ride a motorcycle (Suzuki GSX650F). Also, something that was extremely important for me was having the strap so that once I got off the airplane, I could attach it to my roller bag and hit the ground running. The bag is padded well, with strong zippers that close all the way down to the side and arm straps that are sturdy and padded. Great bag great price. I'm satisfied.</span>
