<span>So like many restaurants who are forced to offer as many take out and delivery services out there we've recently had to sign up for multiple delivery services.<br/><br/>But if you're just relying on the old regular printer ink and paper (using a B/W Laser printer). Its not the cost its the time and space these things take up. Especially if you need to stock up. Since we use a wired LAN order ticketing system - the 3 1/8 thermal rolls are already in use (which this printer uses).<br/><br/>So win win - we have the consumables - now we just need the printer that WORKS with the kiosk locked tablets supplied by &lt;&lt;insert your delivery service here&gt;&gt;.<br/><br/>So I have 3 tablets<br/>Service  Is it compatible?<br/>Seamless/Grubhub  Yes<br/>DoorDash  No<br/>UberEats  No<br/><br/>Setup:<br/>Its straight forward:<br/>1. Load the thermal roll<br/>2. Plug in power<br/>3. Start the installation process<br/><br/>Installation/Setup:<br/>This is the WIFI model.<br/><br/>Standard setup is to set the printer into "connect" mode and you click the WPS button on your WiFi Router and Bam you should be connected ( this is true for MOST setups ).<br/><br/>We installed a more robust and secure enterprise setup (Ubiquiti Access Points if anyone cares) and being enterprise doesnt have a WPS option (security and all).  So to set this up manually:<br/>1. GET your WiFi Network info. SSID (exact case sensitivity name) and Password and security type.<br/>2. Download the printer APP to the phone (IOS and Android Avail)<br/>3. Connect to the PRINTER as it defaults out of box as a Access Point (go to wifi settings on your phone etc etc)<br/>4.  Start up the printer specific App, select the printer you want to edit, click settings and look for WLAN settings.<br/>5. Change printer WLAN from ADHOC access point to Infrastructure mode and fill in with details gathered in step 1<br/>6. Save and Send commits to the printer<br/>7. Printer should flash and if you view printers from a computer on the network you should see this printer available as a network printer if everything worked.<br/>8. Go to Seamless tablet and click on settings<br/>9. Add printer and a PRINTER will show up now<br/>10. Set auto print and the # of tickets you want to print.<br/>11. Voila when a delivery order comes in it auto prints and front end just needs to keep a ticket and 2nd copy goes to kitchen.<br/><br/>My difficulties in setup is due in part to my pre-existing setup. But once it got it going boy was it a time money and reputation (team members kept forgetting to check the app to manually PRINT on the pc) saver.<br/><br/>Oh what about the other two delivery services? I had to order the BLUETOOTH thermal printer... Its arriving shortly and ill update if that is compatible with all three tablets once I get it :).</span>

<span>I have square stand/iPad combo and bought this for my booth at events.  Took minutes to setup. Plug into power source. I then used the included USB cable to plug the printer into the accessory port on my Square Stand.<br/>Loading thermal paper was as simple as dropping in the roll, ensuring it was feeding in the proper direction and closing the lid.  Turned on the power then fired up Square app on my iPad. Added the print station via Hardware menu and ran a test print.  Wow that was easy.  And for the $$ it should be.  I just wish I could have used my DYMO XL instead of having to purchase another printer.  Square just won't recognize it.<br/><br/>The receipt layout and content is setup within Square (web version).  I have a detailed logo and the print quality displays it perfectly.  The anti-curl feature delivers nice flat receipts.<br/><br/>Note: You get a sneeze of a roll of receipt paper so be sure to pickup more with your purchase.  I picked up Thermal King 3.25" x 230'.<br/>You can get the thinner rolls as it comes with an adapter to hold them, but it also requires downloading an app to change the setting to recognize the different sized roll.</span>

<span>This printer worked great and was fairly easy to set up to our POS upserve system - had to change the port on the backside so it was compatible with our system but other than that it was a simple replacement. However - I purchased this printer back in Aug 2021 and it just stopped working yesterday 2/10/22 - I've tried just about everything to get this working again as it is the only kitchen printer we have. Very stressful. And obviously the printer is not cheap which is understandable but spending ~ $600 on a printer for it to stop working 6 months later is very disappointing. Any tips on how this printer can be repaired are appreciated.</span>
