<blockquote><em><div class="a-row a-spacing-small review-data"><span class="a-size-base review-text review-text-content" data-hook="review-body">
<span>It works great for me in the Truck. When I have it on my ear and the phone rings, I can answer by just saying "answer" after the head phone tells me where the call is from, it lets me ignore or answer by speaking. I works well with maps on the phone, in my dump truck I can not hear the phone when I am following the directions but with the head phone I can hear every turn very well through it. No problem with the Pairing of the headphone and the Iphone. Every morning when I turn on the Headphone is auto connects with no problem at all. I could not talk with my spouse on phone for noise in the truck but with the head phone she does not hear noise at all.</span>

<blockquote><em><div class="a-row a-spacing-small review-data"><span class="a-size-base review-text review-text-content" data-hook="review-body">
<span>It's an improvement over the 250.  It seems more durable.  I stuff it in my laptop bag like the I did the 250, but it seems to take the abuse better.  It has the option for over-ear/around neck vs over-head.  I use it when I commute 1 way for an hour, take a road trip by myself, or in the airport.  I've asked about the noise around me and coworkers say they can't hear it during meetings.  It pairs nicely with both my laptop and phone to work with MS Teams or take phone calls.  I can toggle between both devices easily.  I stumble with the voice prompts to answer a call, but that's me.  When I'm aware and respond correctly, it works.</span>

<blockquote><em><div class="a-row a-spacing-small review-data"><span class="a-size-base review-text review-text-content" data-hook="review-body">
<span>To begin these headphones are very good for their intended purpose.  But there are some things that are done poorly and that are inexcusable at this price point.  I will list the good and the so-so below.<br/><br/>1. Noise cancellation/mic clarity:  Very Good but not as good as earlier cheaper models (ie B250 XTS has superior noise cancelling.)  But the noise cancelling here is still very good.<br/><br/>2. Sound Quality:  OK to Good.  The sound quality as stereo headphones is ok to good.  The lows and highs are there but barely and they are a bit muddy, even when you are in low ambient sound environments.  This is understandable as this is not the primary function of this unit.<br/><br/>3. Microphone (not clarity):  Disappointing.  The mic has two negative features.<br/>a) It is encased in a hard plastic boom that only pivots from its connection to the earpiece section.  This is substantially inferior to the gooseneck mic of other BlueParrot models because it is more prone to breakage and it is not adjustable for different size heads/faces.<br/>b) It swings from its pivot point so you can adjust its height relative to your mouth which is good, but it can only be used when the headphones have the mic on the right side of the face.  There are folks who, for various reasons, may need to use it from the other side or change sides from time to time.  With this model it is impossible to put the mic on the left side.<br/><br/>4.  Earpiece Cushions:  Fair.  I love the idea of having two earpieces, i.e. a full headset.  But the earpiece cushions are very cheap and do not offer a premium fit/feel as headphones in this price point should.  The head band is fairly tight, though adjustable, which is good because this keeps these headphones securely on your head. However, the earpiece cushions are not sufficient to mitigate the strong pressure applied by this tight headband.  This makes for discomfort on the ears after just a few minutes of use (I suppose those with very narrow heads will not experience this discomfort or will have less of this discomfort).  I am still working on a way to mitigate this discomfort for me.<br/><br/>5. BlueParrot App:  Fair.  Because it is an app there are many things that could be done to improve - as is the way with all apps, so I will only touch upon one glaringly missing feature and one internal coding flaw.<br/>a) I was under the impression that the firmware on the headset was updatable via the app.  This is incorrect. You must update the firmware via a Windows or Apple computer. I use a Chromebook. I would not have made this purchase if I knew the firmware can only be updated via Windows or Apple computers and not Chromebook or the app.  There are two opportunities missed here, either would have been sufficient for me, though updates via the app would be the best choice for most users.  This would have been a dealbreaker for me had I understood correctly.<br/>b) The BlueParrot app is always running in the background on your phone using both battery and processing power.  As a Developer and Systems Engineer, I understand why it was coded this way.  However, with some thought this app/hardware system could have been architected in a far superior manner.  Settings made via the app could have been stored on the headset thus saving phone resources. (The walkie Talkie feature would take other, creative architecting but the rest could have the app not running in the background.<br/><br/>6. The aux cable that came with mie is faulty.  The sound is garbled when I use it.<br/><br/>Summary:  This product is a very good product that accomplishes its primary purpose very well (though not excellently due to the reduction is noise cancelling as compared to previous models).  The fit and finish, comfort, and features expected at this price point are a bit wanting.  I will keep and continue to use these, once I find a way to mitigate the discomfort of the earpieces, but I will not purchase these again until some of the above mentioned issues are overcome.</span>

<span>I’m a delivery driver and needed a unit I could use while I used my phone for GPS. I got tired of using the Apple iPods that never stayed in my ears (or hurt after a period of time) and noice cancellation that didn’t work. This device is comfortable to wear all day. My wife doesn’t hear all the background noise anymore, and best of all it is simple to work while driving. I love them!</span>

<span>Here’s a pros and cons list;<br/><br/>PROS<br/>* Answering calls and texts hands free is nice. As someone who works full time and always has full hands, this is really nice.<br/>* They’re small and there are no wires, so I don’t have to untangle or worry about wires getting messed up when I put these in my bag. I can also put them in my pocket.<br/>* The charging case is convenient. I like only having to charge the case every three or four days, and always having it on me in case my earbuds get low.<br/><br/>CONS<br/>* They don’t fit in my ears. They constantly fall out, so I’m always readjusting. If I walk at a fast pace, it seems to speed up the process.<br/>* They’re not noise cancelling.<br/>* The sound quality is a bit weak. I have 8 dollar headphones that are better with sound quality.<br/>* They cut out sometimes for no reason and I can’t figure out why.<br/>* They aren’t very loud.<br/><br/>I think that for $100, these could be much better.</span>

<span>This sound great! I have had them for a couple years now and I love them. The only thing I will say is they don't always stay in my ears so I had to get an cord to link them together so when one falls out it stays around my neck.</span>

<span>My oldest niece had been asking for airpods forever! She has beats, but she doesn't want big headphones on. I finally surprised her for her 12th birthday with them and her face lit up like it was the fourth of July! They were easy for her to connect to her iPhone and she was jamming within seconds! They are very comfortable and have great sound quality. It's also great to have the little pod to charge them in and keep them from getting lost. I'm definitely Uncle of the year for this gift!</span>

<span>Taking the Apple AirPods at face value, they're a solid headset for the money! If you already have the original, first generation AirPods and just want to upgrade, not a bad option either. The 2nd generation AirPods feature an improved software chip &amp; runs off of BlueTooth 5.0 vs 4.1 (Gen 1). The software chip allows a faster, stronger, and more stable connection with your device(s). This particular item for $139.00 does NOT feature the wireless charging case. This one must be plugged in via USB (cable provided in the box) to an outlet or USB port. The wireless charging case model is $169. Now if you're looking to upgrade to the wireless charging case later on, you can. Apple does sell it separately. If you want the wireless charging option right out of the box, I recommend sending the $169 vs the $139 product here.<br/><br/>Sound quality: Straight out of the box, sound is pretty solid. No crackles, static, pops, or any abnormal noises created by the more economic-friendly headsets. You have a lot more adjustability &amp; tuning capabilities if paired on an iOS/Apple device vs using for example paired with an Android OS device. So, ultimately Apple users may or may not get a better sound quality experience.<br/><br/>Noise cancellation: AirPods do fit fairly well in the ear without having to be jammed inside your ear canal. Generally they create a snug fit using Apple's "universal" earphone design, it is one size fits most not one size fits all. Some users have upgraded or opted to spend the additional funds on a set of AirPods Pro due to the rubber tips for a better/snug fit. I believe only the AirPods Pro currently has an active noise cancellation utilizing two microphones but I would double-check Apple for accurate information. Also, for Android users. The Galaxy buds by Samsung feature active noise cancellation &amp; wireless charging case on every model so you might want to look into that product before making a final purchase.<br/><br/>Battery life: For optimal battery life, I highly recommend charging both AirPods inside the case. The case itself is a battery pack with a life. So if one or both AirPods are low on battery, you can toss them in the case and charge them up. Apple I believe rates 5 minutes of charging time is equivalent to 1 hour of talk/listening time and 15 minutes of charging time is equivalent to 2 hours of talk/listening. I'm sure this is accurate when they're brand new but I'm sure like anything, normal ware &amp; tare might diminish that over time.<br/><br/>Warranty: Apple provides a 1-year standard manufacturer's warranty on this product. This ONLY covers defects/defaults from the manufacturer. This will NOT cover physical and/or liquid damages to AirPods, case, or charging cable included.<br/><br/>AppleCare: It's $29.00 and 2 years and well worth the extra money. You're already spending this kind of money on a headset, may as well have protection. We get it, accidents happen! But protect yourself and get your AirPods repaired/replaced at no additional cost to YOU! There is no additional fees or deductibles involved.<br/><br/>AppleCare tips:<br/>You don't have to install AppleCare right away. You have 60 days from the original purchase date to contact Apple by providing your AirPods serial number (on outside of the box) and Apple will tell you if you're still eligible.<br/><br/>You can renew AppleCare for another 2 years for the same fee of $29.00 provided you want to keep the same product. If you decide to upgrade to the AirPods Pro or whatever the latest model is, you would have to purchase AppleCare for that specific product.<br/><br/>You can go into an Apple store location and get live repair/replacement on your AirPods.<br/><br/>Using AirPods with Android:<br/><br/>Apple has allowed Android and other non-iOS devices to use AirPods since the AirPods pair/connect via BlueTooth.<br/><br/>If you're using AirPods on an Android platform such as Samsung or LG for example there's 2 ways to pair the headset to your device. You either turn on BlueTooth on your device, pop both AirPods inside your ear, find "AirPods" under available connections, and connect. Or you might have to pair manually using the button on the AirPods case to make available, pair, and connect.<br/><br/>FAIR WARNING:<br/><br/>You will NOT have access to all features that the AirPods have to offer on an Apple/iOS device. You will be limited on functions you can perform.<br/><br/>I was able to find an app on Google play store for $1.99 called "AirPopUp". It is a paid application that unlock access to certain/more features of the AirPods similar to what an Apple/iOS device would be granted. Be aware that you will NOT have access nor the ability to have every single feature since you're not on Apple's network. There may be other apps (most likely paid applications) you'd have to find that may unlock more features such as: AirPods battery life percentage, case battery life percentage, programming LEFT &amp; RIGHT AirPods for certain function(s), skipping/pausing/resetting songs, answer/decline/hang up phone calls, find my AirPods, and more.<br/><br/>For Samsung users specifically, you might want to look into the Galaxy Buds. They're a little cheaper than AirPods, I believe Amazon has them for $109.99 + $22 3-Year insurance through Assurion that does cover physical/liquid/accidental damage just like AirPods.<br/><br/>Galaxy Buds features:<br/>Made by Samsung<br/>Audio powered by AKG<br/>Rubber ear bud tips<br/>Pair with Samsung device to get the most<br/>Wireless charging case<br/>Active noise cancellation<br/>Comes in multiple colors (black/white/silver/yellow/red &amp; black combo with Star Wars edition Galaxy Note 10+)<br/>Includes changing cord and replacement rubber earbud tips.<br/><br/>I know if you pair the Galaxy Buds with a Samsung device it will automatically download an application titled "Galaxy Wearable". This allows users to check battery life status of the case and each bud, prompts you for software updates, ability to program LEFT &amp; RIGHT earbuds to do certain function(s), answer/decline/hang up phone calls, pause/skip/reset songs.<br/><br/>Apple may charge a lot of money for their products on accessories but they never fall short of being a revolutionary, well-designed, reliable product that works as advertised.</span>

<span>The price was reasonable for a Jabra headset, and the brand + price combination was attractive.  The first problem I faced was fit.  Initially, the headset stuck out from my ear at a roughly 45 degree angle, which I remedied by bending the larger ear hook until the device was closer to my ear. Then the earpiece that was on the headset didn't fit my ear at all, and the other two that were included were no better.  Being a packrat at heart, I had saved earpieces from other purchases, and after about an hour's trial and error, I found one that both fit the headset speaker and (fairly well) my ear.  Perhaps because the earpiece wasn't a great fit and the headset position wasn't optimized, the sound seems "distant".  The volume control only helped a little, as it seemed to have relatively little range from quiet to loud.  Many times, I'll switch to the phone speaker because I don't hear the caller very well.  On the positive side, it does seem to remain charged all day, but I'm not a heavy user. In summary, it was fairly inexpensive, but took a fair amount of time to tailor to my anatomy, has limited volume range, but doesn't seem to lose its charge during moderate use.  For heavy users, it's probably not a great choice.</span>

<span>I guess I got spoiled with my Plantronics Bluetooth earpiece because this one does not tell you how much talk time you have left, notifications block person speaking a bit, and overall flimsy. When I pick it up or shake it I can hear the button's moving. Not very well made.

Found this one and figured what the heck, I'll give it a try. Very glad that I did. Sound quality is very good, but I wish I could turn it up one or two more notches, as I'm a little hard of hearing. I used it with the Waze app on my phone driving home from work to see how it performs. It was great and I could still listen to my radio while driving. I have never tested the total battery life per charge, but it worked solid for 6-7 hours a day for me. Have not tried to listen to any music yet but may give it a try. It comes with a wired second bud it you  want the "stereo" effect.<br/><br/>Great buy for someone needing basic ear bud device</span>

<span> After hearing the buzz and seeing the leaks on these over the last few months, I was anxiously awaiting their release.<br/><br/>Now, with them in hand (or ears, rather), I have some serious concerns.<br/><br/>I wanted these for the use of listening to music and equally, if not more importantly,  for hands free phone calls.<br/><br/>For the record: I have paired these with my Samsung S8 phones. I have alternated between two S8's and have found identical results<br/><br/>Being a 100% Android and anti-Apple consumer, I can honestly say that Apple got it right with the AirPods.  Not only for sound but for call transmitting and receiving audio quality.  The Galaxy Buds Live may not be up to the same level in the call quality department.<br/><br/>Call Quality:  From my first call, the audio I heard from the caller sounded quite good. Then the audio I was hearing began to sound a bit distorted and I kept experiencing a lot of digital noise. What I found is, if I put my phone in my pocket, or I'm holding my phone and I put my hand down by my side, it almost seems like I lose connection or there is interference. As if the signal is poor. But, if I'm holding the phone upright, or almost right near my face, the sound seems fine. Shouldn't be like this.  On the plus side, in comparison with my Bose headphones, multiple callers said these sounded equally as good on their end.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, I have to rate the call quality as Very Bad at this point. After being sent a second pair, same exact issue.<br/>I am curious if this is some form of a software incompatibility issue with the Samsung Galaxy S8.  Because the call quality is so poor, and I intended on using these heavily for calls, these are now likely to be returned.<br/><br/>The Fit:  Very interesting but nice. They're light, comfortable and once you trust that they won't fall out, you really feel like they're not even there.<br/><br/>Music/Audio:  Sounds great. I'm not a $1000 headphone audiophile.  It needs to sound clear with your highs and mids defined and just good in general. Sound quality is very good. Here's the catch was that though. I started noticing the same signal issue that I was noticing with the call quality. While I was watching/listening to a YouTube video and I put the phone in my pocket or I walked away from the phone, mind you only a couple feet away, it seems like there's interference or the reception is bad. It cuts out constantly. Again, this shouldn't be happening.<br/><br/>Active Noise Canceling:  I'd have to say that my Bose QC35ii's are my benchmark for ANC. That bar is pretty high.  The Galaxy Buds Live disappointingly offer little in terms of ANC technology.  If you're looking for the same level if ANC that you get from a good pair of over the ear or in ear silicone tip ear buds, this will not measure up.<br/><br/>I experimented with this.  While sitting indoors, in a relatively quiet setting, you almost feel like you notice the ANC effectiveness.  Walking down the street with moderate car/traffic noise, I noticed absolutely no ANC effect. Merely an automatic battery drain at best.<br/><br/>Wearable App:  Good.  It would be nice to have a more dynamic equalizer option rather than the "canned" sound profiles.<br/><br/>Overheating:  I've yet to actually find information on this in the manual, but I believe that they have an overheating prevention feature where the individual earbud will begin beeping continuously in your ear. The audio playing, in my case a podcast, doesn't stop but a continuous beep begins. Not being able to figure out why, my best guess is that this is an overheating warning. I had been sitting outside and my left side was facing the sun. It was not excessively hot out and the actual left earbud did not feel warm or get warm in my ear. However, it repeatedly kept beeping.<br/><br/>General Performance:<br/>- In the home office and around the house: Not bad. I enjoy the lightweight design. As long as my phone is in front of me and not in a pocket, audio and call reception and quality are good.<br/>- On the elliptical: Nice. Comfortable and stay in place. Slight movement as you build a bit of a sweat.<br/>- Outside for a walk: ANC is non-existent. I also notice wind noise if it's a little breezy. By breezy, I mean a very light and intermittent wind. Not a hurricane.<br/>- On a bicycle ride: Crazy wind noise. Very off-putting, unfortunately.<br/>- Online Microsoft Teams Meeting (Android App on S8): I was told that I sounded distant and the audio was thin. As soon as I disconnected and called the person directly, they said I sounded great.<br/><br/>Summary: Very disappointed at this point. This is primarily due to the reception issues.  The price point is great for what I had expected. However, for what they are, I'd just as soon spend much, much less for a set of wireless headphones since making calls with these simply doesn't seem to be a good feature, out of the gate.<br/><br/>After running through all of the same with two separate sets of GBL's, using two different S8's, I've gotten identical results. I'm hoping that perhaps this may just be an S8 compatibility issue, as indicated earlier. I would enjoy editing this review to be nothing short of incredible, in the future.<br/><br/>Because they are so new, Samsung telephone support couldn't be all that helpful. With these being, literally, on the market for only a couple of days, there wasn't a whole lot of trouble shooting assistance available.<br/><br/>At this point, I've gone through two sets of these and have not seen a difference between the two. I'm torn whether or not I should return them. I so badly want them to work out. But, I'm finding that they're just not measuring up.</span>

<span>Sound quality is great! And they are very comfortable. You can forget their even in. Downsides is for me that it seems like my ear produces more for a lack of better word, ear wax trying to remove the foreign object out of my ear. You'll have to continuously push them back in your ear while running. Then the song will pause or skip. And once your hands get moist from sweating it's nearly impossible to pause or skip to the next song. And if your hair gets damp it will pause the song when it bounce up against the buds while running. Would have given 5 stars if smaung sold the case separately if you lose it.

Must bring some level of noise cancellation.<br/><br/>I use an iPhone 11. I bought the following buds:<br/><br/>1. Apple AirPods Pro<br/>2. Samsung BudsLive<br/>3. Master and Dynamic MW07 Plus<br/>4. Sony WF-10000XM3<br/><br/>After spending time with all four, with my iPhone, the first to get the cut?<br/><br/>The Apple AirPods Pro. I did not like these at all. They would, no matter what tip I used, create any kind of seal. This meant they fit horribly, sounded tinny, and had no effect with ANC. This is only due to the fact that they do not fit my ear. I even purchased several 3rd party tips, none changed these. The design, for me, fails. Again, that's my ears. I have large ears, and always need the largest tip with any earbuds to get good sound. The AirPod Pro's were my least fave.<br/><br/>Next up were the much raved about Sony WF-10000XM3 which I thought sounded so much better than the Apple's and I even preferred the design, though they seem a tad large. Big sound, a great seal and the best ANC of these four sets. The negative with the Sony is the size and design. They look like an old school bluetooth earpiece. But value wise, these are home runs. I used the largest eartip and the sound was big, bold and deep. The ANC was very good though not even close to the over the ear Sony's. But, after 2 hours they started to hurt my ears.<br/><br/>Next, the Master and Dynamic MW07PLUS. These are amazing in design and style. They are the best made as well, but they are not comfy for any long period of time. These are the largest and heaviest buds of the ones I have tried, and while they fit better than the Apple pros's, and sounded much better, the noice canceling does nothing, and there is no kind of real transparency mode as the one included doesn't work well. For sound, these best all of th buds I am testing out. Beautiful sound, and amazing battery life. Best of the lot. But when it comes to comfort, these are hard to wear for long. I ordered new eartips to see if I can get an even better fit as I always have to fiddle with them after a few minutes to reseal.<br/><br/>The Samsung Galaxy Buds Live. I was attracted to the bean style, and bought a pair in black. These are the smallest of them all, and the case is as well. I read reviews saying they sound tinny, or there is no noice cancelation. The opposite is true for me. I think these are meant for larger ears like mine as these are the only buds to fit in my ear like a velvet glove. They paired easily to my iPhone and the sound blew me away. They were second best in sound, beating the Sony and Apple's but falling short of the M&amp;D. These have the loudest volume of all as well, which means I can listen at 40% rather than 90% (with the M&amp;D as they do not go very loud). These present a warm leaning sound with fantastic deep bass. Not the most definition or detail but they sound pleasing. The ANC works, and is noticeable. It's not hard to hear. The reason why others do not hear a difference is they are not fitting in the ear right. My wife, she can not use these as they are too large to fit in the ear. So for some, these will not fit and hence you will have weak sound, lack of bass and notice no ANC. When these are in, and music is at 30% I hear NOTHING from the outside world. When music is off, sounds from fans, AC or things of that nature are dropped nearly in half. The app is easy and intuitive and works great on my iPhone. The best thing is, these fit in the ear and never move, I never need to adjust, and they look cool, sound great and offer nice sound cancelation.<br/><br/>I am keeping the beans. The BudsLive are my pick from the four I tested out. For my ears. For comfort these are the best for me. For sound. these are the second best for me. For price, they are the least expensive yet they look the nicest in the ear.<br/><br/>The MW07 Plus are my next faves for the gorgeous audiophile like sound quality but they lack in volume and bass so many will not prefer this sound.<br/><br/>The Sony's feel dated by comparison with all of these, and my guess is Sony is working on the M4's which I feel will be smaller and of course, improved.<br/><br/>For me, I love the little beans. I much prefer them to the AirPods Pro which were. my least fave of the bunch.</span>

<span>I don't usually write review on amazon,<br/>but I was just really not happy with what samsung is doing here.<br/><br/>First of all, let me introduce myself, I am a audiophile that has experienced and owned quite a lot audio equipment from extreme high end ones (the $50,000 hifiman Shangri la system), to flagship overear/in ear (beyerdynamic T1, xelento) that cost around  $800 today, to extreme cheap ones like the under $10 ve monk.<br/><br/>But I am NOT the type of audiophile that only nitpicking sound quality in his/her subjective way and care nothing about comfort, longevity, good features etc.<br/><br/>Far from that, I value a good fit and comfort over many other qualities. and for certain type of headphones, I value  features like convenience, noise cancelling over sound quality.<br/><br/>But I have a MINIMUM BAR of sound quality of course.<br/><br/>HERE COMES THE REVIEW of the galaxy buds live:<br/>OVERALL:  2/5<br/>I give it overall 2 out of 5 because there are products (namely galaxy buds+) that's better then this in nearly every way and has lower price. And buds live has its own issues.<br/><br/>COMFORT and FIT:  3/5<br/>IN SHORT, need some work to adjust the fit, some parts irritates skin after long wearing.<br/><br/>If you absolutely can not wear in-ear earphones, then this is not bad and this is pretty much your only choice for  true wireless headphones along side the original air-pods.<br/>But the issue is, everywhere this little thing touches your ear is hard plastic except for the tinny little rubber tip that sits in the upper part of your outer ear. And that rubber part has a pretty small contact area, your ear will be irritated for usage over 30 min or so.<br/>And it's not the easiest earphones to adjust its position correctly and securely, you'll find yourself adjust it quite a lot before you can finally enjoy your music. And the fit affects the sound quality a lot, by a lot I mean if you don't push down the lower part to ensure the speaker is as close to your ear canal as possible, this thing would sound bass light, and if you push it down all the all, it's absolutely bass heavy. I can imagine different people hearing quite different sound from it because of there ear shape. There's a reason for high-end ear-buds all using in-ear design.<br/>ADD: the case is among the smallest, which is a plus. but it's not a standout quality in 2020<br/><br/>FEATURES: 1/5<br/>IN SHORT: noise isolation is worse then regular in-ear headphones without active noise cancelling feature. and touch controls are usable but nothing special.<br/><br/>The buds live should NOT be advertised as a noise cancelling headphones, this is one of the two reason I'm writing this review. In fact, the noise cancelling level is substantially worse then the galaxy ear buds+ which has no noise cancelling feature.  pretty much ANY in-ear headphones will isolate better then buds live.<br/>The touch control and all other small feature set are nothing special, usable and usual is the word I would give.<br/><br/>THE ESSENTIALS for true wireless headphones 3/5<br/>IN SHORT: good battery life, unstable connection, short connection range.<br/><br/>the good thing is the battery life is good, not the best, but good for most. around 6 - 8 hours without noise cancelling on.<br/>The connection however, is not good. a lot of the time it has syncing issues when connected to my windows computer, usually put them back in case would solve the problem, this problem is quite frequent that it would annoy you quite a bit. And non of my other true wireless headphones have this issue, at least not to the extent that it annoys me. Connect to my galaxy s10 have much less issue though, only have sync issue when switching from device to device occasionally. The connection range is not good too, the signal cuts off completely when I walk from my desk to the bathroom, and for the reference, at the same spot at my bathroom, my airpods pro works normally without any signal loss, my galaxy buds+ would buzz in and out a bit.<br/><br/>THE SOUND:<br/>IN SHORT: acceptable,  3/5<br/>The sound I would describe as V shaped, somewhat muddy in low to mid frequency. average resolution, a better then average sound stage and imaging. I feel the driver in this has potential, but it's restricted by the ear bud design choice, since this thing has no seal, they have to adding quite a lot of bass by eq/dsp to compensate for it. And I think they overdone it, and ironically, the bass is certainly plenty in terms of quantity, but it doesn't have the smooth, fast and deep extension quality that comes out of galaxy buds+ from samsung themself.<br/>The mids are overshadowed by the lows. simple as that.<br/>The highs are average, nothing exciting about it.<br/>The sound stage are good for in-ear, imaging are above average too, but the lack of detail (which is understandable for a bluetooth heaphone without aptX or LDAC support) means you can't really pinpoint, and the muddy bass is not helping.<br/><br/>Conclusion:<br/><br/>this is a complete downgrade from the galaxy buds+ I have. It's harder to wear, less comfortable except for people who cannot withstand in-ear design. It has shorter battery per charge, from around 12 hours from buds+ to around 7 hours from buds live. It has worse noise isolation, which is unacceptable since it's in the advertise. The sound quality is average, not nearly as good as galaxy buds+ in terms of bass and mids, somewhat at the same level in highs and soundstage. And buds live has a higher price tag. And these two product come from the same company, which annoys me quite a bit. What's the thinking behind it, samsung and your AKG department? advertising? something new? "the new open ear noise cancelling?" it's just wrong in my opinion.<br/><br/>My recommendation for true wireless headphones as in time of writing this review:<br/><br/>The utility beast:  airpods pro<br/><br/>Pros:<br/>1. Probably the most stable and furthest connection from named brand, for ios, or for android and windows.<br/>Very good audio/video latency, which makes it very usable for mobile/casual gaming, or even just watching video.<br/>2. A solid noise cancelling and transparent, natural sounding is the word I would call the feeling of both noise cancelling and transparent mode. The mic quality is also among the best if not the best in true wireless.<br/>3. A comfortable fit. less pressurized feeling then most in-ear headphones. a bit chunky, so not the most comfortable for your long session listening, but if you don't jam it too hard into your ear, you can listen to airpods pro for quite a long time, over 2 hours I would say.<br/>4. A relaxing and enjoyable sound. it's doesn't have much detail/resolution, lack some high notes in particular, average sound-stage, not very pin-point in imaging, too. But I gotta say, it sounds good enough, even for audiophile like me. Part of the reason is the noise cancelling helps to make sure you can hear as much performance as it can offer. The other part is that the tuning is just easy to listen to, a good bass extension without too much mid-bass, a bit mid-forward makes the vocal stand out, which is good for a lot of the mainstream pop music, a reduced high makes it easy to enjoy your music for a long period of time during travel. And the sound is also very consistent,  a deeper or shallower insertion doesn't affect it much.<br/><br/>Cons:<br/>less then 5 hour of usage per charge might not enough for some.<br/>and really, besides not "great" sounding for those who can not withstand anything less then true audiophile quality, that's the only shortcoming I can think of.<br/><br/>A taste into audiophile world: galaxy buds / buds+<br/>Yes I have own both buds/buds+<br/>Pro:<br/>1. good fit and comfort, low-profile looking. You may feel a little pressure when you first put them like most in-ears. But they are by far the most comfortable true wireless earphones for long listening sessions.<br/><br/>2. Great sounding. I challenge you to find in-ear headphones that sounds significantly better then these, wired or wireless. Especially for the original galaxy buds, As they are under $100 today and honestly, besides bass not as deep as buds+, I prefer the sound of the original galaxy buds since the mids are not as recessed and highs are more smooth comparing to buds+. sound stage and imaging are both very good in buds/buds+;<br/><br/>3. Great battery life per charge and good mic quality. over 12 hours of battery life per charge and a good enough mic quality is the reason you buy buds+ over buds<br/><br/>Cons:<br/>connection and range are not the best (but totally usable).<br/>battery in case only provides one more charge for both buds/buds+. so if you forget to put your buds/buds+ in the case once over night, you might lose half of your total battery life.<br/>For people need active noise-cancelling for travel, these don't offer the feature, (but it still block quite some noise for everyday use).<br/><br/>For those considering sony and sennheisers's true wirelless, Consider the large size of them, they might not fit you, and the cases are quite large too. So I just don't bother trying them.</span>

<span>These comments apply to Beats Flex released in late 2020.<br/><br/>I got this item to replace a set I bought in  early 2020 from another store. That set was great, but the left bud housing cracked when I fell asleep while wearing them. Besides that lack of durability and phone call quality, I liked the original product enough to repurchase it (at a sale price). Even so, I have some issues with the new set. My impressions are below.<br/><br/>Connectivity: These Flex does not connect as easily to my phone nor remain connected as reliably for listening (see the phone audio quality comments below). I use these Flex with the same phone as before, but the performance aspect of the new Flex is not as good. I believe that the Android Bluetooth settings and the Beats app (Android) interact differently with the new Flex. Where the older Flex seemed to connect quickly, these new Flex require different user actions. Finally, on this point, I have not linked these to my Macbook; however, my old Flex worked flawlessly--and sounded great with the Macbook.<br/><br/>Sound quality: These Flex sound good, but the bass is a bit wanting. I prefer a prominent low-end response, and the low-end on the Flex does not sound as good as the previous set. The highs and mid-range are clear, crisp, and not harsh or too bright, even at higher listening levels. I have not listened to Apple Spatial Audio content. The Dolby Atmos feature sounds about the same compared to the older Flex.<br/><br/>Phone audio quality: These Flex sound great and are superior to the quality of my older Flex. The difference is dramatic. The connection during phone use is stable and quiet with little noise.<br/><br/>Comfort: These Flex are less comfortable because the cord between the buds seems shorter or less flexible. I haven't concluded yet. The ear tips also seem harder and do feel as comfortable. If I find my broken set,  I will swap tips. My initial perceptions of (dis)comfort may be due to insufficient break-in time. If I determine this is the case, I will update this point.<br/><br/>Battery performance: The new Flex provide long listening time. I have frequently gotten more than 12<br/>ours of non-continuous use between charges. I am pleased by the battery performance.<br/><br/>Other features/Accessories: Flex comes with an assortment of 4 different-sized eartips and a USB-C to USB-C cable for charging Flex. The cable is much too short for my use, being only about 4-6 inches in length. I have not used the cable because it is inconvenient, and I do not own a USB-C charging adapter; however, I have a suitable adapter supplied with my phone. In the box, as they say, should be a longer cable and an appropriate adapter.</span>

<span>When I purchased these, they were available new and direct from Amazon (not a third party seller) for $49.95. I see they have jumped up in price by $20, not sure why, but for $50 they are perfect.<br/><br/>I have a pair of JBL Tune wireless earbuds I have been using for years, but they make my ears sore if I use them for more than an hour or so and they never feel that secure, which is why I started looking for a pair of earbuds that are wireless from my phone but still have a wire that connects the two buds together, in case of one falling out and getting lost otherwise.<br/><br/>I have small ears, so the Beats Flex earbuds having a very small earbud cushion option included was a pleasant surprise, these have been the most comfortable earbuds I have ever worn. I used them for nearly five hours straight yesterday and had no soreness after, which I can't honestly say for any other earbuds I've used throughout my life. They also never felt as risk of falling out of my ears, they fit securely. The wire between the earbuds feels very strong and doesn't make me feel like I have to be hyper-aware of tugging on them to prevent damage. The control buttons on the wire connecting the earbuds are placed conveniently. I just need to figure out how to 'un-kink' the wire so it lays a little more flatly.<br/><br/>And I love the color. Yellow is my 'happy color' and when there is a yellow option is almost anything, I always pick that. It's just a small and inconsequential detail but it's a little thing that makes me happy so I appreciate that.<br/><br/>I am no audiophile, and while listening to music and videos using these earbuds sounds really good to me I cannot really rate how these rank compared to other earbuds as I don't have the trained ear for that type of judgement. They do get decently loud though, and that's coming from someone with progressive hearing loss since childhood. But for what I can confidently judge this product on, I'd say it's a really good one for the price. I'm very happy with my purchase.</span>

<span>I purchased a set of these wireless headphones about 8 years ago.  They'd probably still be working if I hadn't slammed them in the car door.<br/><br/>Pros:<br/>The assorted sizes of earbuds fit my ears way better than the clunky Apple earpods, plus they rarely fall out when I bend over, turn my head, etc.  (I love Apple products but their earpods are not made for petite people.)<br/>These are bluetooth.  They have all the controls I need directly on them, so no fumbling for my phone.  Up and down volume and pause, plus on/off.<br/>I also like that they reduce the noise a lot but not so much that I can't hear the cars or other people behind me.  I hope they never stop making these.</span>

<span>I accidentally dropped these outside the weekend before a hurricane through. I had no idea until I had pulled up on Monday morning at work and saw them where I park. There was so much rain and wind I thought for sure these things won't work. I turned them on and the light actually came on! Of course I am still skeptical whether they actually still function properly. After walking them in, cleaning them, and letting them charge a little. They still worked! I am not sure if they are meant to be water proof and I don't  reccommend trying but I was impressed! This is a solid product!</span>

<span>Mixed emotions! Number one I'm here d to say I bought this unit for the third time today. Also, before the 5200 I have owned at least 3 Legends as well. I am very rough on these units. I work in the field as and HVAC service tech. 75 percent of the time I am working in an extreme environment in one form or the other. I simply will use these little guys to their fullest potential. Today when I lost my current unit, rather than turn around and drive back to the last job site 15 mins each way which is conclusive of my lunch break, s if I ever take one.. I chose to reorder immediately! Was glad the price came down 20 bucks!. I did however wanna shed light on a few key points for this unit. After reading all the reviews this evening (an attempt at shutting down and falling asleep for a few hours), I realized that a lot of the reviews are true and consistent with my experience.  I'm not gonna go on and on about how this unit is far less superior than the Legend, but case in point is it for sure has way less battery life. It never charges to 7 hours. 5 most of the time and 6 if I'm lucky. To be honest o have forgotten most of the attributes of the legend seeing I haven't used mine but once in the last 2 years.. it was refreshing though the couple times I did use the Legend.. blah blah.. battery life sucks on the 5200, but I got used to it!<br/><br/>The noise cancelation feature is and has been consistently the best by far. In fact I find myself frustrated when I ask a coworker or client if they can hear the sound I'm hearing while I'm troubleshooting.. they say that they can not gear anything! I want them to hear the slamming of a bad compressor or the hammering of a bent fan blade, but they simply can't hear the background. So for me that's great in a way like when I'm in heavy traffic and other devices are squaking in my rig, i usually have the windows open to "air out" between jobs. It is also great when I'm in a noisey mechanical room. Etc etc.. good and bad all at the same time for me but the noise suppressing tech is amazing to say the least.<br/><br/>From day one I have been merely disappointed with the FACT that the volume buttons do not work!! Several times I have almost wrecked while driving and trying to adjust the volume. In fact.. my Samsung galaxy s21 ultra 5g will not even allow me to turn up my speaker volume manually from the headset (docked on the dash) while the 5200 is on and in my ear.. i mash the volume up button on the phone and it goes a little up then goes all the way back down.. similar to a broken power window on a car or one slightly off track.. uppy downy.. uppy downy.. you get the idea!.. intey to mash thw volume buttons on the 5200 and nothing happens.. unless I press so hard that it actually stings my finger! I've grown used to this BS as well.. let me remind you folks that despite all this negatively,  I dropped a C note this afternoon without hesitation so that maybe I could be hamdsfree again in 2 days. Maybe I should have went back to a new Legend but that darn charging situation is so inconvenient for me.. see I can rejuice the 52 in an hour while I'm on a call that does require telephone or one where I have no cell signal anyway.<br/><br/>Now in the attic, or on a roof top.. or even in damp dingy crawl spaces I sweat pretty bad like anyone (almost) would.. very seldom is it a problem. I do not use the stock earpieces.. I get some others that fit me better on Amazon.. coolatas or some crap.. anyway the little red and clack soft ear pieces work best for me with the sweat. They are more slim than the factory ones and fit more snug into my ear canal. I do occasionally have to scrap out some wax 😅..<br/>I mighy add that it hardly ever falls off or becomes uncomfortable.. when it does.. I hang it up and give a charge..<br/><br/>When I wanna take it off to speak to a client etc..I just throw it in my pocket with all my drill bits and  screw drivers.. it takes the ride like a true champ.. incan remember the legends would break in my pocket then the sharp ass metal on the boom would stab me.. i use gorilla glue on those to fix that.. but the 52 has no issues there...<br/><br/>Well folks there it is folks, pay day is on Friday and sh$! runs down hill! Any questions?<br/><br/>Ps my review is 3.5 🌟</span>

<span>I ordered the Plantronics Voyager 5200 just when pandemic work-from-home in March 2020 began because my beloved Jabra headset finally gave up the ghost.  I was confident the Plantronics would sound good (I have an even more expensive Plantronics headset at work), but was totally unprepared for the utter pain-in-the-(“neck”) it is to charge.<br/><br/>THE GOOD:<br/>- It’s easy to pair and the behind-the-ear style is lightweight and very comfortable to wear for extended periods of time.<br/>- The noise cancellation is really impressive.  If you’re walking outside and a Mack truck passes you, the person you’re speaking to will barely hear it.  Wind noise is likewise cancelled very effectively.<br/>- The top volume could stand to go one step higher, but it’s adequate at the highest volume.<br/>- It’s relatively easy to arrange for right- or left-sided use, although it can be a little confounding to contort it from one side to other.  However, since most people will want to use it on the same side all the time, that shouldn’t be a practical problem.<br/>- The battery life is decent, but nothing to get excited about.  If you’re lucky, you’ll get about six hours of talk time.<br/><br/>THE BAD &amp; THE FRUSTRATING:<br/>- This is an *expensive* headset!  But if you use it all the time, you figure it’s worth the investment, right?  Well, for me it has been a mixed blessing.<br/>- It has the worst micro-USB charging port cover in the history of micro-USB charging port covers.  Opening that *tiny* rubber protective port cover (which has no indentation or tab to grab) without damaging it requires either the sharpest fingernails in the world, a razor-thin knife blade or one of those microscopic eyeglass screwdrivers.  It was tempting just to rip off that stupid rubber cover, but I was concerned that the connector would get full of dust and gunk.<br/>- After a frustrating week of using the micro-USB charging port every day, I basically felt forced to spend another $35 to buy the matching charging case.  (Alternatively, you can spend more up-front and buy the headset *with* the charging case, which I would highly recommend if you buy this headset, assuming the combination pack is cheaper than buying the items separately.)  The case has a built-in battery to recharge on the go, and even has two sets of tiny blue lights to tell you the battery level of the charger and the headset.<br/>- The charging case can be used either of two ways:  you can either contort the headset into exactly the right position and stick it inside the case (which requires that you un-contort it after charging to put it back on your ear) or simply place it on top of the stand (in the little charging slot) and use it as a desk stand.<br/>- The charging stand is quirky and temperamental.  I naively thought a desk-stand charger would be ideal and convenient.  Silly me.  Plantronics, which is famous for their proprietary and annoying charging connections, likewise equipped this charging case with a proprietary, annoying and *quirky* charging connection:  the headset has four tiny copper strips on the back which need to aligned perfectly to the charging strips on the charging stand.  When you place the headset on the desk stand correctly, the little blue lights will come on so you know it’s charging.  Sounds simple, right?  WRONG!  It *usually* connects correctly, but about 1/3 of the time, you have to move the stupid headset on and off the charger multiple times to get the charger to recognize it and flash those little blue lights, and sometimes you have to blow hard onto the contacts to remove dust particles which apparently impede the connection.  But the worst is, sometimes the little blue lights come on and you think it’s charging, but you wake up the next morning to find that, not only did the headset NOT charge, the charger actually *drained* the battery, leaving you with a completely dead headset.  This happens so frequently, I have to remember to check the Plantronics Android app (which is almost as flaky as the charging system) every time I put the headset on the charger to make sure it says “charging.”  Sometimes it saying “charging” and and sometimes it doesn’t, requiring you to jiggle the headset around some more until it actually starts to charge.  (My $200+ Plantronics office headset, which has a different proprietary and annoying charging connection, has precisely the same flaw.)  This is not a particularly fast charger and I have heard no technical justification for this ridiculous connection system, so I have to assume it was created simply to force you to buy a proprietary Plantronics charger.  This is a HUGE drawback in my opinion.<br/>- After a year or so, the headset started randomly disconnecting and reconnecting to my Android phone.  It doesn’t happen that often, but often enough to be really annoying.  I have reset the headset sensors countless times, upgraded the firmware (which requires downloading the Plantronics app and plugging your headset into your computer), re-paired the headset to my phone and done pretty much everything else I can think of short of burning chicken feathers and chanting, but the Bluetooth connection has definitely become less reliable.<br/><br/>BOTTOM LINE:  When it works as it should, the 5200 is the best-sounding and most comfortable Bluetooth headset I’ve ever had.  When it doesn’t, it makes you weep over the money you spent and all the aggravation making sure it’s actually charging.</span>

<span>I have been working with a lightning adaptor into a Sony headset for some time when working in the office at my computer. I'm in IT support so being hands free is essential. The annoyances were:<br/><br/>1) the headset was inline in the cable so didn't always face the right way.<br/>2) The lightning adapter and the headset cable were a bit weak so broke one lightning cable already and I suspect I now had a loose connection in the headset cable<br/>3) Walking around was a nightmare, the cable would snap on the height adjuster on my desk when I stood up, I'd get up forgetting it was on and drag my phone off the desk etc.<br/><br/>I did a bit of research and this headset tended to get very good reviews so I bit the bullet.<br/><br/>A) Its comfortable - It often feels a little loose and out of position but actually it never falls off and I can always hear clearly - I just need to get used to the fit and the fact it doesn't insert in the ear canal which is good as they tend to irritate after a while.<br/>B) The audio quality so far is perfect - It does have a slightly different sound to the phone itself but its sharp and clear and I never had problems hearing and people say I sound clear.<br/>C) The software on my iphone is great- I can check for firmware updates, change the language (for voice prompts etc) and select whether I want music to play through the earpiece or not so it has some good controls.<br/>D) The siri button is good - I can stop/start audio with a push, answer and disconnect or hold it to dial via Siri.<br/><br/>I have only used it for half a day so far but its been great. I just put it on my ear and turn it on and I can walk around and carry on with my day and not have to rush and find my phone and then my headset and plug it all in. I'd constantly say to people "Just a second while I plug in my headset" and hear them continuing to jabber on. Its light, comfortable and doesn't irritate my ears at all and normal earbuds drive me crazy in a very short time.<br/><br/>So really the only caveat is I haven't had it long enough to see how good the battery life is but its filling exactly the need I purchased it for. Time will tell as far as reliability goes.<br/><br/>I've given 5 stars on everything as it reports 5 hours of talk time and so far I've spoken for about 24 minutes on the charge it shipped with and the remaining time is reported as I would expect. Even on my worst days I think I'd struggle to talk for more than 2 hours total.<br/><br/>Ok - Been using it for quite a few days now so to update:<br/><br/>1 - Its VERY fast to connect. Power it on and its connected to my Iphone 12 Mini in a second and ready to use with no delay for Audio. My car stereo takes about 5 seconds to boot and connect and then once connected its another few seconds before the audio starts.<br/><br/>2 - I needed to play with the settings a little - Sometimes I'm with someone and a call comes in, normally I just hit the volume down button on my phone so it carries on ringing rather than actively rejecting the call - When I did this the other day the headset carried on talking in my ear and I ended up answering the call anyway - I realised it says "Answer or Ignore" and if I hit the headset button it answers or I can say answer - If I say ignore it rejects the call. You can turn that feature off in the app on the phone that controls the headset so I have to hit the button to answer so it won't interpret me carrying on talking as a request to answer. This is another good feature of this headset - The app gives good control of options and firmware updates. Some headsets are a nightmare or even impossible to update the firmware, this one is a breeze.</span>

<span>Got this because I'd had issues with other headsets bad noise cancellation. The person on the other end couldn't hear me in noisier environments, especially if my voice wasn't as loud as the sounds around me.<br/>I was mostly interested in the boom mic because I figured that a microphone closer to my mouth would pick up sound better. But this headset goes far above and beyond. With the Voyager the other party often can't even hear sounds around me such as fans or air conditioners that used to make it impossible to talk, but they can still hear my voice with no problem.<br/>My only complaint is the battery life. I get a bit more than six hours, which is respectable, but with the larger size of this unit I was really hoping for a longer battery life. This means that I still need to keep my cheap Bluetooth around to listen to music and audiobooks, and then I switch to the Voyager when I start a call.<br/>Far from a deal breaker, but it would be nice if I could use one headset for the whole work day.<br/>I would also like to see the charging case included at a lower price point. The case is about $40-60 from Poly, but bundles with the headset and case seem to start at about $100 more than the headset alone. Hoping that this is due to supply chain issues and that people will stop gouging so much when things settle down again.<br/><br/>All in all, it's a great unit and I would definitely buy one again.</span>

<span>this is the best model of bluetooth headset I've used, so I've bought four of them over the past 6-8 years.  One was lost, the dog chewed one to bits and one quit working.  I'm starting to get people complaining that the excellent sound quality is going away, although the sound I hear is still very good.<br/><br/>I've been willing to put up with these issues because of the key features this offers.  The biggest is that I can either answer or reject a call by just talking to it, plus anytime I get called by anyone in my contacts it announces them by name.  ie "Susan Smith calling.  Accept or ignore?"  If I want to take the call I just say answer, and if I want to send it to voicemail I say ignore.  This is really handy when my hands are messy so I don't want to dirty up my cell with either the mess from cooking or the grease if I'm working on a car.  I also like the 7 hour talk time and 18+ hour standby time.  It also charges from below half charge in less than an hour.<br/><br/>Be aware that unlike their older models that used micro-USB chargers this uses a proprietary magnetic adapter, so if you lose it (as I did on a business trip once) you can't do anything to charge it.  UNLESS you buy the protective charging case. Then you CAN charge it with micro-USB, plus the case has an internal battery that can charge it once from half charge.  So it protects it from damage when you aren't wearing it, lets it top off the charge if you put the Legend into the case while you're on a flight and lets you easily find a charger to use with it.<br/><br/>The Legend supports A2DP streaming so I use it to listen to podcasts or streaming audio like Pandora, the several hundred songs &amp; audiobooks I have stores on my phone &amp; as well as any other video with audio like Netflix, etc.  At 28 grams it's so light that I have to constantly check to make sure it hasn't fallen off!  I also like that it just goes into the outer ear so both ears are open to hear sounds around you and you avoid the discomfort of having something plugging your ear like an earplug does.</span>

<span>This headset is not perfectly perfect in every way but it is the best that you can buy.<br/><br/>This is the only headset in the Plantronics lineup listed as having "premium" quality sound. It is Plantronics' flagship headset. Plantronics is the industry leader in earpiece headsets. If you are looking for the highest-quality headset you can buy, look no more. You have come to the right page.<br/><br/>The primary complaint I've read about on the Plantronics customer service site is that after two years the battery will die a natural death due to old age. So do realize that this will not last forever. If your battery dies while the headset is under warranty, that's too soon and Plantronics will replace it. If your battery dies in less than 2 years but out of warranty, Plantronics is currently offering customers substantial discounts to buy replacements. (Save your receipt! Scan it if you're paperless. Or buy it from Amazon where they will keep a record for you.)<br/><br/>I just bought my second one - the first lasted about 4 years for me with light use. I did read that some can get extra life out of their battery by putting the headset into a ziploc and then into the freezer overnight... so if you're here for a replacement, you might try that first and buy a little more time. I got a few extra months out of mine by discarding the (optional accessory) case I was using to charge it and by charging it directly through the OEM cord that came with it (so save that too!).<br/><br/>WHAT YOU GET:<br/>Packaging is Easy to Open: there is a large sticker sealing the opening to the smallish box closed. That is easily cut with a pair of scissors. Then pull out the cardboard wings that are tucked into slots on each side of the front of the box and open it up.<br/>- Plantronics headset (battery is permanently installed)<br/>- Proprietary charging cord with separate wall plug<br/>- Two additional ear plugs -- larger and smaller than the one preinstalled on the headset<br/>- Foam covers for the ear plugs, to use or not as you prefer<br/>- Instruction Booklet<br/>- Instructions on Firmware Update<br/>- Safety Warnings<br/>- Some stuff in another language<br/><br/>The cord is USB on the wall end and proprietary on the headset end (only matches the headset). That means that you can plug the cord into the computer to get firmware and software updates from Plantronics (which is the first thing that they recommend you do upon unpackaging your headset). The cord is short, just under 10" long (without the connectors).<br/><br/>It's easy to change the ear plugs in and out so that you can try different sizes. You just press in and turn to the left. To insert one, you press in and turn to the right. (All of this is in the instruction book.) I found that I could use the small or the medium. I'm a 5'7" woman who weighs more than she should but you wouldn't hate sitting next to me on a plane. The ear plug sits loosely just inside your ear. You may not even feel it. It's definitely not a snug fit and you will hear surrounding sounds in both ears. What keeps the headset in place is the rest of it, not the ear plug.<br/><br/>The boom mic is adjustable. I found it was directly pointed toward my mouth in it's lowest position.<br/><br/>The device has a call button on the round part, from which the boom extends. That's for taking and ending calls if you don't want to use voice commands, which also work. On the underside of the boom is another button that mutes calls among other things. There is a volume rocker on the upper back part of the largest part of the device -- the part that goes behind the ear. And below that is the on/off switch. At the bottom of the back is the charging connector -- just a bit of recessed coppery looking metal.<br/><br/>It reads "Plantronics" in very subtle small pale gray lettering at the bottom of the largest part of the device, on both sides. You can see where it is in the small shiny black part at the bottom of the picture.<br/><br/>If you have the right expectations (it's not a magic genie... It may only last for two years... A very few of them will be defective and will require replacement...), you will be delighted with your purchase. You will not find better sound quality anywhere else. If you are used to music headphones, the looser, more open feel of the headset in your ear (or barely touching the front of your ear), might take some adjustment.<br/><br/>I highly recommend this product and am confident that, if after reading this review you still want it, you will not be disappointed.<br/><br/>UPDATE: One feature I have come to really appreciate is the voice commands. Some parts of my house get spotty cell phone reception. So, when I'm wearing the headset (during work hours), I always leave my phone in a "good reception area" of the house. If a call comes in, I don't have to rush back to the headset to pick it up, I just say, "answer" and the headset picks up the call. If the caller is in my address book, the phone will announce who's calling. If I'm silent or say "decline," the call is not picked up.</span>

<span>This is easily the best bluetooth headset I've ever used. I have had the pleasure of testing out many different bluetooth models for various manufacturers, and the issue I always run into is comfort. I have small ears so the over the ear designs are always falling off, and the ones that rely on an earbud alone to stay in place have always been too big to fit properly and end up popping out as well. While the "default" earbud that comes with the headset is too big for my ear, it includes two other sizes, one smaller and one larger. The smaller one fits well and the foam replacements you can buy here on Amazon fit even better. I have worn this for hours while talking to my fiance on a long road trip and it stayed comfortable the entire time and never fell off once.<br/><br/>Comfort and fit is a big deal to me, but call quality is also extremely important. I've tried calling many different people, on various different phones. All reported that I came through loud and clear, which is a big deal for me because I tend to speak softly and if I don't have a boom right in front of my mouth, I'm often not heard well or at all. The boom on the Voyager Legend, even though it doesn't come anywhere near my mouth, is able to pick up my voice easily and deliver it clearly. I also did a few tests to try out the background noise filtration and I am absolutely amazed. I called my fiance while in a car with 3 other people talking and laughing with each other and noise playing quite loudly. He reported that he heard none of it, only some muffled sounds he couldn't distinguish but weren't at all distracting or obtrusive. I didn't quite believe him, so I tested it myself in a similar scenario and was very surprised at how well it blocks out everything but the caller's voice. It's a great feature if you're constantly on the go and around other people. I am buying one for him now because every time he's driving in his Mustang, I can barely hear him over the noise of the car, especially when he's running the AC.<br/><br/>Incoming call quality is also superb. I had been using Apple earbuds with my iPhone 6 Plus for months because none of my other headsets were comfortable for long periods of time or stayed in place. I had been craving a wireless headset as I tend to talk a lot throughout the day and I don't like being tied down to my phone. I can't even begin to tell you how many times I had my earbuds and/or iPhone yanked away because I got hooked on something. The Voyager Legend is so light and comfortable, I completely forget it's there until I get an incoming call. I wasn't sure if I'd be okay with wearing it all the time due to wanting to avoid the whole techie nerd look, but even with the extended boom, my long, dark hair covers it almost entirely. Even when it doesn't, I don't think it looks bad at all. In fact, it's the nicest looking bluetooth headset I've seen.<br/><br/>The Voyager Legend doesn't skimp on other features, either. You have access to a completely hands free device at all times. When a call comes in, you will be told who is calling and then asked if you want to answer the call. You can say "answer" or "ignore". You can also push the call button to answer as well as disconnect. Pushing the talk button while not on a call will prompt you for a voice command. If you have an iPhone, you can hold the call button to activate Siri. The mute button also has multiple functions. It can mute/unmute the call and can also pause or resume music playback. It's nothing super fancy, but it's all I need. One of my favorite features is the auto answer/disconnect feature when the headset is put on or taken off. If I have the headset in my purse and I get a call, I can put it on and it answers the call automatically.<br/><br/>Another huge bonus for me was purchasing the optional charging case. The Voyager Legend provides an estimated 7 hours talk time and it seems to hold true to that. However, I take a lot of road trips and I needed a way to charge it on the go. The charge case charges in 90 minutes and will recharge your headset twice on a single charge. It's fairly compact and protects the headset very well with it's hard shell, so it's perfect to toss in my purse. It charges the headset pretty quickly. From what I've seen, you can't use the headset while it's charging so this was a must have for me. I also purchased the desktop charger which holds the headset in place nicely so there's no fear of it accidentally getting under something and getting broken. Even if the extra chargers aren't needed, an extra charging cable is highly recommended. It uses a magnetic charger, much like the MacBook chargers, and can only be charged with the included cable (unless you purchase the charge case). The included cable is extremely short, but you can buy a spare for cheap here on Amazon and it's much longer. It's always nice to have a back up, especially for such a unique cable that can't be found in most local stores if you happen to lose your original one.<br/><br/>Overall, it was a great purchase and I'm so glad to have it. My other headsets are collecting dust now!</span>

<span>Was hesitant to get another set of wireless earbuds for TV watching as with my current setup, you cannot control the volume and the other pair I have (that cost about 6x as much) were consistently too loud. But then the left earbud stopped working &amp; I decided to get a "bargain" pair &amp; use them only with my phone if volume level was low or high with TV. The auto volume is perfect &amp; these are smaller, more comfortable &amp; have much longer battery life. Tempted to buy another pair while they're still on sale. Great buy.</span>

<span>These earbuds are by no means any $100+ AirPods or other brand, but for the price they are they have some pretty good options and rather good audio. They have adjustable audio stabilizers, they last easily 8 hours per charge (plus more with the charging case) and I’ve always liked the more plug fit earbuds. You may have to replace them in a year or two, but to replace ones with this price is a whole lot painless than ones much more expensive.</span>

<span>They're not super loud but for the price they're pretty good... I was worried about them falling out but the magnet is pretty strong, in fact they r kinda hard to get out if u got fat fingers lol..

<span>I have 3 pairs of these.  One for work, one for home, and an extra pair for backup.  We have a noisy toddler upstairs at our apartment, and this definitely helps out with canceling the noise.  The only problem I've had with these is that they don't fit my ears comfortably. I have small ear canals and had to buy a pack of the cushions to make it fit correctly. But all in all, I love these.  They are also great to put on when I am going through sensory overload.  Also be careful that you don't overcharge them. The battery will not last long if they are are overcharged to many times.</span>

<span>These earbuds are extremely convenient for my use case, which is office use and use while driving. From a pure convenience perspective, these are almost perfect. They block out noise as you might expect for a good noise cancellation system. I would say that the overall noise cancellation is better than over-ear offerings from Bose like the QC 35 II or the NC 700 (both of which I have). They are solid in my ear, and come with 3 sizes of tips. I have used them jogging and not been worried about them falling out. The touch controls are easy to use and configurable with their app. The pass-through mode in particular comes in handy for me, and it is easy to switch to quickly. No need to ever take them out. They work well in the car as well. The sound is about what you might expect from Bose, just fine for the vast majority of people.<br/><br/>The main issue is the case. The charging case is just too thick. It would be better if they made it longer or wider instead of thicker. My only other complaint is that they are uncomfortable for longer usage. The wedge-shape may be great for noise isolation, but it is not great for long-term user comfort. This only becomes an issue after an hour or more of using for me. Your mileage may vary.<br/><br/>This isn't a complaint per-se, but it is a consideration. Every time you buy a device with a battery inside, you are buying a device with an expiration date. At some point you will end up throwing these away. I don't even mean this as an environmental thing either, just worth considering that these will last you maybe 2 years, 3 or 4 if you are careful with them. Less if you use them enough to wear out the battery quicker. You could spend less money on something like the Meze 99 classics/neos and a FiiO BTR5 to power them, for about the same amount of money, and have the headphones last you 20 years or more with care. Not to mention that the sound quality would be far greater.<br/><br/>For the audiophile perspective, the sound is OK at best. I do not use these for recreational listening at all. They are fine to use in the office, but I find myself listening to less and less music and just using the noise cancellation or listening to a podcast. This is because while me from 5 years ago quite liked the sound of Bose in general (big step up from "free" apple earbuds), now I am seriously into audiophile gear; I only use these for the sheer convenience they offer. The sound quality is just not great. Again, they are just fine for the vast majority of people. If you are an audiophile, they will not sound good to you.</span>

<span>I have purchased numerous premium earbuds over that last several years and I have to say Bose has really outdone themselves (and the competition) this time.  The Sony XM4s are perhaps the closest in terms of sound quality, the Beats Fit Pro the closest in terms of comfort and secure fit, and the Airpods Pro in terms of transparency ..... but in my opinion, the new Bose earbuds are better in all of these areas. Specifically, the sound quality, comfort and fit, and transparency are all better with the Bose.  And perhaps the best feature of all is their noise cancellation - no one beats the new Bose buds in this area.  Even the Sony over ear headphones (XM5) and Bose 700s can not filter out both low end and high end noise frequencies like the new Bose QC 2 earbuds can - they are clearly the very best at noise cancellation period.  Are they perfect?  In most of the important areas (ANC, Sound Quality, comfort and fit), I have to say yes.  In areas of lesser importance (at least to me) are lack of true multi point paring (although the "switching" feature helps some in this area), lack of wireless charging, and battery life is just average.  The Bose App is not as feature driven as the Sony app - and I suppose some improvements in the App itself would be welcome.  But overall, I believe these maybe the best earbuds I have heard on the market right now.  The only qualifier to this statement is that I have not listened to the new AirpodsPro 2 - and based on earlier reviews, these may give the Bose buds some stiff competition.</span>

<span>There is an awful lot to like about the Bose QuietComfort Noise Cancelling Earbuds. I will break down the good and the bad below but, suffice to say, these are possibly the most polarizing ear buds I have ever had on. I guess that makes it the perfect set of buds for 2020. Here is the breakdown:<br/><br/>The good:<br/><br/>-Active Noise Cancellation (ANC): We can just get this out of the way. If you want best in class noise cancellation on an earbud, these are the set to get. Period. I have the class leading Sony ANC earbuds, the new Technics, the Samsung Galaxy Live, and have spent extensive time with the Airpod Pros. All have solid ANC but none can approach a good set of over ears. My over ear Sony WH-1000XM3's put them all to shame when it comes to turning off the outside world. I am not ready to say that these Bose buds can duplicate that level of ANC but it is close. When you get a good seal and have the adjustable ANC level on 10, the world is gone. I was out hanging Halloween decorations a couple weeks ago and my neighbor across the street was mowing his lawn. It looked comical. It appeared that he was mowing with the mower turned off. I couldn't hear it. Once I realized the trick the ANC was doing, I strained my ears to really focus and try to hear anything. Nothing. Finally, I plucked an earbud out and there it was, loud lawn mower. If great ANC is the mission, stop right now, and just buy these.<br/><br/>-Sound: Like all Bose products, these sound great. A few years ago, I would be raving about them. They have the classic signature Bose warm tonality, nice solid bass, a full mid section, and crisp resonating highs. However, after using products from Klipsch, Sennheiser,  B&amp;O, and my other afformentioned ANC earbuds, either my taste in sound has changed or my expectations have. I recently received a set of new wireless earbuds from Shure and they sound unbelievable. The detail and sound stage are amazing. These just don't sound as good. They are better than any of my buds from Samsung or Jabra for sure and in the same arena as the others. For this price, I guess I was hoping for more. One challenge may be that Bose doesn't give you the ability to customize your sound. You can customize your ANC experience just not your sound. It has to be the way Bose wants you to hear them. Frankly, this is a stunning omission. They have a great app. Just not sure how or why you leave that out. Maybe someday an update can remedy this. In the meantime, these buds sound great. Just know that at this price, there are earbuds that sound a bit better out there.<br/><br/>-Connection / Pairing: As you would expect, these come with the latest and greatest chip set as well as Bluetooth 5.1. To pair just download the Bose Music app and follow the directions. You will be all set in maybe ten seconds. Range is great. 30 plus feet through walls. All is exactly as you would expect from a high end set of buds.<br/><br/>-Intangibles: Bose gives you a very fancy auto pause they call auto transparency. Pluck a bud from either ear and the others ANC turns off. Pretty slick but there isn't a regular touch pad transparency mode. Weird. You get quick charging (5 minutes on nets 2 hours use) via USBC and Qi wireless charging. Good stuff.<br/><br/>The bad:<br/><br/>-Form factor: There is no other way to put this. These Bose buds are big. HUGE actually. While everyone else is going small, Bose went big. Some of this must be to accommodate the internals of the buds themselves. I am also guessing that, in order to get a good seal, like an over ear, they determined that they needed the extra size. Oddly, in spite of this size, they are quite comfortable and lightweight. So, while I am hitting Bose for an overall negative here, if you can live with the look, you will not mind how they feel. One more note here, you really need to try all three sets of wings as you need to get a good seal in order to experience their magical ANC.<br/><br/>-Battery life: Not a negative but definitely NOT a positive. Less than six hours on bud for me. That's in line with my other ANC buds but you would think Bose could squeeze a little more out of these since they are like satellites hanging out of your ears. Further, the case is large. I took a couple pictures next to my other buds for perspective. You only get two more charges there. Should be at least three. There is an external LED battery life indicator which is well done. All and all just should be better.<br/><br/>-Controls: For buds this big, Bose should let you control everything here. Instead, you have very limited pause/play, ANC controls, etc. No volume. No track control. These are big omissions. Pretty much means your phone always need to be at your side. Just not acceptable.<br/><br/>The Wrap:<br/><br/>Listen, I have been pretty hard on these. I feel like at $279, I should be. However, I will say this. After a few days, I 100% planned on returning these. Yet, here I am a couple of weeks later and they haven't left my side. I am not sending them back in spite of all of their shortcomings. They sound great but, more than anything, when you hit the ANC on these, the world around you vaporizes. These days, I can live with an awful lot of compromises in order to make that happen. Cheers to the Bose team on making a classy yet odd looking set of buds that give you world class ANC.<br/><br/>***Update*** I have lived with these now for a few weeks. The things I hit these for still bother me but my original 4 star review is being moved to a 5 star. There are a few reasons for this. First, while huge, I just love wearing these. They are super comfortable for long sessions. They don't jam into your ear canal but simply push against it. The Bose design team deserves a lot of credit here. They are just really well made. Something I didn't fully grasp when I wrote my initial review. Plus, they actually look kind of cool.  Secondly, as I said originally, the ANC really is amazing. Every day I use them I am more and more blown away. They just literally make the world disappear. Lastly, they sound great. I still long for an EQ option in the app but I don't really miss it in real world use. Here is the bottom line; I have a drawer full of high end earbuds and headphones. For the last few weeks, I grabbed my Samsung Live Buds once. Every other day I have reached for these. They are just simply the best buds I own. That doesn't mean that my prior criticisms aren't reasonable. It just means that everything these do well they do really well. They aren't inexpensive but, if you can pull it off, I highly recommend making the investment.<br/><br/>***Update 2.0***So one of my major gripes just got a little better. Bose just updated their app and it now includes a toggle to add volume controls on bud. You will find this toggle in your settings. Simply flip volume control on and you can now swipe up and down on the right bud to control volume. It is very well done. There is still some work to do on this front but we are getting there. Keep up the support Bose.<br/><br/>One more update here that I think is relevant. In the last few months, I have added both the Master and Dynamic MW08's and Bowers and Wilkins new buds to my arsenal. Both cost more. The Bose represent themselves very well in this premium group. Both the M&amp;D's and the B&amp;O's sound a bit better. The B&amp;O's are actually shockingly good in the way they sound. However, none of them hold a candle to what these can do with ANC. They are just so good at removing the world around you. Of ANC is the objective just buy these. You deserve it!</span>

<span>Browsing my order history going back to 2015 I've had 4 pairs of cheap wired earbuds.<br/><br/>My favorite headphones are the Sony over ear WH-1000XM4. I tried the WH-1000XM5's and still liked the older model better. The Sony's spoiled me for their noise-cancelling ability. I fly for work almost every week. When I got this job the first thing I did was research headphones and picked up the 1000XM2's and loved them.<br/><br/>I've been hunting for a pair of wireless noise-canceling earbuds for a few years. I tried Samsung Galaxy Buds Live, Samsung Galaxy Buds+ Plus, Sennheiser Momentum True Wireless 2, Sony WF-1000XM4 earbuds, SAMSUNG Galaxy Buds Pro, and now these Bose QuietComfort Earbuds II.<br/><br/>I wasn't expecting much from the Samsungs and they lived up to my expectations. I returned them. The Sennheisers were the greatest sounding earbuds I have ever heard, but they were uncomfortable and the noise cancelling was poor. The Sony earbuds were also poor at noise cancelling and didn't sound that great to my ears, especially compared to the over the ear models I love. They were also finicky and uncomfortable.<br/><br/>I never seriously considered the Bose options in the headphones / earbuds game. "No highs, no lows, must be Bose." The Bose sound has always been my least favorite. Clear, midrange, just baffling why people like it. Maybe my ears are damaged, but just not for me. Then I read a review. I took the plunge. No kidding - the noise cancelling on these is as good as the Sony over the ear models.<br/><br/>My test for noise cancelling is taking the earbuds for a walk. I do a few miles around the neighborhood every day - and after the Sony's entered my life, the 'clomp clomp clomp' of my footsteps with any other earbud/headphone has driven me crazy. I put these on last night and played a few tracks on TIDAL Master quality - Beatles, Prince, some classical, and there it was. That midrange Bose sound that drives me batty. I switched between these and the Sony's - and the Sony's sound great with no tweaking. They just sound great. I have fallen in love with pipe organ recordings because of the Sony's I think. I love the way the recordings sound and feel in the Sony's. No way these Bose are going to cross this hurdle of sounding like Bose. It's just what they are, not my taste.<br/><br/>This morning I tweaked the EQ on my phone to make the Bose less Bose-sounding, and started on my walk, and I couldn't hear my footsteps. I COULDN'T HEAR MY 'CLOMP CLOMP CLOMP.' Oh my goodness. Why do these have to be Bose! These things are a miracle. A MIRACLE. So I dug into my phone's sound settings a little more and saw they have different sound settings for people, depending on their age. I clicked on my age (none of your business!) and the Bose sounded better. More in line with what I'm used to. I played a pipe organ piece and it didn't sound as full as the Sony's but it was fine. It passed my test.<br/><br/>I have read the Bose doesn't use the fancy high quality codecs the Sony's use. I could hear sound degradation on quieter passages of a classical recording - but I looked at the recording and it was on a not top-tier label, so maybe it was just an average recording. But the bottom line is- after returning several pair of earbuds for the reasons spelled out above, I am actually going to keep these.<br/><br/>I discovered the Bose app has it's own EQ which tweaks the sound a little better than my phone's. There is also a mode where it cancels the sound I want canceled ('clomp clomp clomp'), yet I could hear cars approaching and my feet crinkling leaves in the street. Fantastic!</span>
