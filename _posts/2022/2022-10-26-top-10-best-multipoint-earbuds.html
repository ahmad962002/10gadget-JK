<div class="slideshow-container">
<blockquote><em><div class="a-row a-spacing-small review-data"><span class="a-size-base review-text review-text-content" data-hook="review-body">
<span>These are some impressive earbuds.  Sounds is amazing.  These are the first pair of earbuds I've tried that the sound was great right or off the box.  AKA their flat signature sound.  Their eq pre sets are also nice  the ANC Top tier, blocks out just about everything.  Then when u add music.  No outside noise creeps in.  Ambient is good.  I can hear well with music playing.  They fit me well.<br/>To compare.  I've tested a lot of earbuds.  I've probably kept more than I should.  I have and listen with Senheiser m2,  soundcore liberty pro 2, and 3. Galaxy buds pro,  Sony wp800. Also tested and returned the mw3? What ever,  Jabra 75s. With the exception of the m2. These Technics notes the others away. And ask the others sound good to great.  I mean I love the way the others sound.  And use them.  But now these and my Senheiser are my go to's. I've seen a couple of reviews on hear and YouTube saying these sound better than the m2. But not to me.  But the M2s sound perfect to me.  Maybe I just explored the fine tuning options more than some.  Now to the Caveat.  When u enable ANC.  It thins out the sound a lil.  I know a lot of buds do that.  Example the liberty pro 3's. But it's slight and it adjust back some when fully enabled.  But with the technics is more noticeable and doesn't smooth out like the pro 3 does.  It's not a deal breaker to me.  I got them and love them.  And can enjoy with ANC Enabled.  So what else can I say.  One more thing.  My galaxy pro buds sound use to change when u enabled ANC. The bass would be a lil boomier. But that changed with an update and now there's no difference.  I hope  Technic follow that route of continuing to improve these buds with future updates.</span>

<span>I have had Technics products for my entire life - I still use my SU-V7 Integrated Amp in my garage and I have my SL-7 Linear Tracking Turntable in front of me as I write this - not that it gets any use today.  I have owned both products since the early 1980s, and have always loved the better of Technics products.<br/><br/>I was quite surprised to see that they now manufacture Bluetooth headphones so I read a number of reviews, all of which more or less said the same thing.  Excellent sound quality, good ANC.<br/><br/>I decided to purchase a set as I was looking for an upgrade to my Samsung Galaxy Buds 2.  The very first thing I noticed was that I had to turn off the equalization I had set for the Samsungs as the bass was overwhelming.  Excellent, but overwhelming.  I ended up going with a flat response.  I do not have any other headphones or earbuds where I can just leave them flat and find the balance be, well, as it should be.  Bass is strong, but appropriate for the material, and has that ineffable quality that good bass has.  I have never really heard that in a set of earbuds, and only in the best of over the ear cans.  I have a set of HiFiMan Deva Planar Magnetics, and the Technics earbuds give them a real challenge.  I like each for different reasons.<br/><br/>The reviews I read suggested that these had less of an 'in your head' sense, and I have to agree.  I turned on the Ambient Sound mode - I really appreciate these modes when they work as I use my buds when I walk down my local street which has no sidewalk so I need to hear cars from behind.  I discovered that, if anything, I prefer the sound with the Ambient mode on.  That was not the case with the Samsungs.<br/><br/>I was able to turn on LDAC - I had to do this right in the Bluetooth settings for the headset on my phone in addition to the Technics app.  I am not sure it really makes that much difference yet, truth be told these sound fantastic with the AAC which is what my first album/walk was in.  Took a bit to figure out how to enable LDAC.<br/><br/>I think these were well worth the price.  Sound Quality is excellent, they provide a huge array of ear adapters and feel like a quality kit.</span>

<span>The sound of these earbuds is unrivaled. Unfortunately after a few minutes of use, the left earbud would start producing a low frequency pulsating sound that couldn't be stopped.<br/><br/>I tried connecting to different devices (iPhone, iPad, iPod, Laptop) and all resulted in the same "noise" coming out of the left earbud.<br/><br/>I tried to use Amazon chat to get some help, but they had no ideas. I also used Panasonic online support chat. Walked through checking the firmware of the earbuds, etc. They were up to date with the latest firmware version, and after a factory reset, tested and the same sound came back.<br/><br/>Very disappointed, as they would not agree to send a replacement despite these being brand new (purchased Amazon Prime Day). The price for a replacement is $75 more than I paid on the promotional price, so I won't be buying another pair.<br/><br/>I would warn you that the noise in the left earbud is a KNOWN problem. You can search the firmware revisions and in the version released 2019 there was a "fix" for this issue... however it seems the problem still persists even in new products with the latest firmware.<br/><br/>The Panasonic chat rep offered to repair or replace with a refurbished pair, but gave no guarantee of timing. I asked how long this process typically takes and the rep indicated anywhere from 2 to 4 weeks, which is not a reasonable period to wait, since my return window on Amazon would be closed by then.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, they're going back for a full refund. I wanted to love these so much... the sound and bass are amazing (significantly better than my Apple EarPod Pro's, which I've given up on because they die with as little as 3 hours constant use).<br/><br/>Anyone have a suggestion of another brand to try (not Apple) that's as good or better than these Technic's?</span>

<span>I had sony w4's. They are as good as advertised, BUT, they hurt my ears. Got the technics az60 . They are not that much different then the sonys. Great sound and thumping bass. I hardly notice they are in my ears. I live alone and don't travel much so I can not comment on the ANC or battery life. They are never really uncharged for me. Very pleased. Only concern, they have a 30 day warranty. Looking for great earbuds...get the az60s.</span>

<span>As someone that used to be a sound engineer, I am VERY picky about my audio equipment.<br/><br/>Whether I’m on a Zoom call for work, listening to music while working out, or enjoying a podcast while grilling, I need something that’s comfortable AND high quality.<br/><br/>The AZ40s fit seamlessly into my lifestyle. I’m able to do everything I need to do during the day while wearing them…<br/><br/>* The earbuds are compact &amp; lightweight and come with 4 sizes to choose from. They are more comfortable than I expected!<br/>* Compared to other wireless earbuds, they provide an amazing music listening experience! There are 2 modes. You can hear the world around you (when watching the kids) or drown it all out. Plus, the Technics app makes personalizing your experience even easier.<br/>* Making clear calls is easy thanks to six individual mics, wind noise reduction &amp; JustMyVoice Technology - perfect for the busy RV lifestyle!<br/>* Great battery life!<br/><br/>Oh, and did I mention they don’t have the same price point as some of the others ;)<br/><br/>Definitely recommend!</span>

<span>These earbuds are great if you have an android, but with with iPhone the microphone doesn’t work. But otherwise the speakers are ok but the build quality is pretty terrible. The earbuds themselves have pretty good build quality but the case is really cheap feeling. Honestly a plus since it is charged with USB C. Overall okay but it most definitely could be better!</span>

<span>I was a bit nervous to receive the earbuds because I always have issues with them falling out or making my ears sore. Thankfully these came with multiple ear pieces in different sizes that ensured comfort. Love the case it comes in, sturdy, sleek and compact. I used the earbuds for a flight, cancelled all background noise and even helped with my ears popping. I highly recommend these earbuds!</span>

<span>I have been very happy with these earbuds. Sound quality is very good, noise cancellation is excellent the battery life is good for the earbuds themselves but you also have the case which provides additional juice to recharge the earbuds. The case will quickly recharge the ear buds.<br/><br/>Loading the earbuds into the case is very simple they self seat and each earbud will only seat into its perspective slot ‘L 7 R” slot. So, you don’t have to worry that they didn’t charge.<br/><br/>They are very comfortable in my ears for long periods of time, touch sensors are very responsive and easy to use.</span>

<span>I bought this earbuds for a specific use case, which is to connect to 2 devices at the same time without unpairing and pairing to get the audio. Since we are all working on Zoom these days I need a single earbuds that will connect to my laptop for work video calls and cellphone at the same time in case a call comes. I do have a Jabra Evolve 75 at home which has the Multipoint Bluetooth technology but I didn't want to carry it to my office now that I'm working 2-3 days from office. I did some research and found out that even the Samsung Galaxy Buds Pro or AirPods Pro doesn't support this feature. Most of the good headphones (the full-size ones) have this feature, but not quite common yet in earbuds.<br/><br/>1) Bluetooth multipoint - 5 stars<br/>The whole reason why I bought this. I will only buy any headphone going forward if this feature is offered. Must have in my opinion.<br/>2) Sound and call quality - 4 stars<br/>Pretty decent sound quality and you can tweak it to your hearts content with the available EQ in the app.<br/>3) Active noise cancellation - 4 stars<br/>This is also actually really good and works well in transit, air planes etc.<br/>4) Style, form factor and build quality - 4 stars<br/>Well built, my type of form factor (with the stems), comes with a case that supports wireless charging, case could've been slimmer, but for under $80-100 its okay.<br/>5) Battery life - 1 star<br/>Now this is where this device is completely disappointing. The claimed battery life is 5.5 hours with ANC and 7 without. I barely get 3 hours without ANC. That's less than half the advertised battery life. I bought a second pair thinking the first one was defective and this also have the same problem and exactly same battery life at 3 hours or less.<br/>6) Price - 3 stars<br/>It's fairly priced at $100 retail, but you can find it for $80 at times.<br/><br/>With a decent battery life this will be 5 star product.<br/><br/>Overall I love it for all the features, but can only give 2 stars as the battery life is really subpar and doesn't last a full day.</span>

<span>multipoint works great.  i have a work phone and a personal phone and connects to either one immediately without having to manually disconnect from the other. can use either one independently.  double tap to answer call is fairly quick. used for a couple of months now and only charged it twice.  still have 3 dots left on charging case.  i use about 20 to 30 hours a month.  strictly for phone calls.  very clear voice on my end and no complaints on the other end.  they're not the best looking but are light and comfortable.  pretty ridiculous that $150 to $300 units do not have multi point.

<span>I needed a nice clear sound for work conversations. Incoming sound was fine, but my outgoing voice was not clear enough. Also, I'm not sure how useful the noise cancelation is, because a person I was talking with was asking about birds chirping in the background.

<span>I've only had a few days so please take my review with a grain of salt.<br/><br/>Overall Performance: 5*<br/>Audio: 4*<br/>Call Quality 4.5*<br/>Functionality: 5*<br/>Noise Cancellation: 3*<br/>Battery Life: 4*<br/>Comfort: 4.5*<br/><br/>I know these are $60 earbuds but the price didn't play any real factor into my review of these earbuds as I have and am willing to pay for more expensive earbuds, just a bonus.  I believe earbuds are very objective devices like shoes or sunglasses. What maybe best for one person or group of people will not suit others.  I have smaller ears so the great functioning and sounding Sony WF-1000XM4 didn't fit well in my ears, even after a week of attempting to get use them. I've tried probably 15-20 wired and wireless earbuds and wasn't satisfied with any of them to keep them.<br/><br/>I am not an audiophile so these sound good enough for me for listening to music throughout my day, video, and phone calls. The other end of the call thought my voice sounded very clear and close and I heard the other end quiet well. I use these buds throughout my working day on/off without any battery issue.<br/><br/>I enjoy the earbuds multipoint ability to connect to my phone and laptop at the same time and auto switch without me clicking on anything. I tested the waterproof by showering with them. I appreciate my Android phone showing the battery life of the left, right, and charging case. It supports USB-C and wireless charging so super convenient.<br/><br/>The Bluetooth range is probably one of the best that I've tried. Most earbuds would lose connection to my phone or laptop after I walk about 5-6 feet away if there are stucco walls in between but these somehow managed to keep the connection even on different floor in my home.<br/><br/>The earbuds are lightweight and is relatively comfortable where I don't have to pull them out of my ears because of pain unlike others I have tried.<br/><br/>There is noise cancellation and it does work some but I would recommend you steer away from these earbuds if ANC is a big factor in your search for earbuds as these are NOT it. I actually prefer ambient noise and these do an mediocre job at this as well. Overall, these earbuds have these features but neither are the top of the reasons to get them, if not the reasons to avoid them if they are important to you.<br/><br/>The earbuds support playback control, call control, and voice but lacks volume control (I could be wrong on the volume control).<br/><br/>I download and installed the Lenovo "Smart Wearable" app by Beijing Lenovo Software co., Ltd. after scanning the app for malware because I doubted that it was a authentic and legit app as it had no reviews or signs that it was a legit app. The app allows you to update the firmware, "Find My Earbuds" by making them both ring, Settings (Auto-Off, Auto Play Pause, Voice  Activated Assistance, ANC mode), and Equalizer (Extra Bass, Natural, Vocal, Jazz, Treble, and Custom).<br/><br/>I honestly would pay much 3x higher for these earbuds so $60 is just a big bonus. I am not saying these are the best for anything specific but overall they are the best for me for all the above reasons. They are definitely worth a try to see if they work well for you as they do for me.  Good luck.</span>

<span>Certified virtual Dolby Atmos audio for movies and shows at home through the Nvidia Shield or Apple TV is the best interpretation of true Atmos audio w/head tracking hands down for both music and video better than any Apple earbuds with spatial audio.<br/><br/>ANC is adaptive so it’s not gonna be as good as AirPods Pro, Sony or Bose but decent.  Overall these are the best all around earbuds hands down.<br/><br/>Sound quality is amazing with big bass for those who prefer more bass but you can adjust the sound to fit your liking.  Once Snapdragon sound is enabled you will enjoy lossless audio which is awesome.  Additionally, the plug and wireless cradle will act as a Bluetooth transmitter.  Is it a Snapdragon sound transmitter? Maybe yes only because it does encode up to 96khz with a float pcm bit rate up to 32bits.  It is also useful for TVs with a head phone jack.  Yes they do exist on new TVs.<br/><br/>In terms of comfort the most comfortable earbuds on the market.  Medical grade silicon tips make a difference.  Together with the UV Nano tech these are by far the most hygienic.<br/><br/>Lastly for gamers you do get a game mode which works perfectly when using these with your console of choice. Tip:  Don’t connect the cradle/case to the console directly instead plug it into the headphone Jack in back of the TV.  Much better experience and on PS5 will let you set up 3D audio as the PS5 will think it’s the TV speakers ☺️<br/><br/>No wonder these are sold out at this point .  Thanks.</span>

<span>This review is from an Android user perspective. If I was an iPhone user I would just be using the latest version of Airpods (for open ear experience) and Airpods Pro for closed ear with ANC. However after hearing latest reviews of the Airpod Pros ambient mode, maybe I would be just down to the one set of buds.<br/><br/>But I'm not an iPhone user. I hate iPhones.<br/>I've tried the Airpods with Android and the experience just sucks. I can't even see battery level of the buds from the phone.<br/><br/>So I'm left with looking for anything else.<br/><br/>Here's what I've tried:<br/><br/>Jabra Evolve 65T (closed ear) (first set of true wireless earbuds I've owned)<br/>Jabra Elite 75T (closed ear)<br/><br/>JLab Go Air Pop (closed ear)<br/><br/>Tribit FlyBuds C1 (closed ear)<br/>Tribit FlyBuds C2 (open ear)<br/><br/>Samsung Galaxy Buds2 Pro (closed ear)<br/>Samsung Galaxy Buds Live (open ear)<br/><br/>JBL Live Pro 2 (closed ear)<br/><br/>Sony WF-1000XM4 (closed ear, foam tips. Stock tips too uncomfortable, replaced with small Comply foam tips)<br/><br/>And finally this LG Tone Free T90 (closed ear)<br/><br/>Order of importance for me on features of earbuds is:<br/><br/>1) Comfort<br/>2) Sound quality<br/>3) Mic quality<br/>4) ANC<br/>5) App available for monitoring or changing functionality<br/><br/>For open ear the options are the Tribit FlyBuds C2 or the Samsung Galaxy Buds Live. I tried the Buds Live first and liked them so much I bought two pairs. Then I tried the Tribit FlyBuds C2. They were more comfortable but had slightly worse sound quality. So for my pair of open ear earbuds, I reach for my Tribit FlyBuds C2.<br/><br/>For closed ear (which is why I'm writing this review), depending if I want ANC or not. If I want ANC, I reach for the Sony WF-1000XM4 with the Comply tips. Stock tips medium fit and didn't leak sound via the app leak test. Small stock tips leaked. I bought the small Comply tips and they are even larger than the medium stock tips. They fit and make wearing the Sony's bearable for hours. They are still heavy and I know I'm wearing them every second they are in. So again, if I need absolute silence, I go for the Sony WF-1000XM4.<br/><br/>However, I rarely need silence. So lets go through the others.<br/><br/>JLab Go Air Pop<br/>These are fantastic for what they are, cheap earbuds without ANC. If I need a throwaway pair these are great. But not day to day usage great.<br/><br/>Tribit FlyBuds C1<br/>No matter the tip (only stock tips tried), I couldn't get them to not feel too large or make a seal. These don't have ANC. They just felt like they would fall out. I never reach for these.<br/><br/>Jabra Evolve 65T<br/>These introduced me to the world of true wireless earbuds. The sound sucks. These are in the vault to never be used again.<br/><br/>Jabra Elite 75T<br/>Better than the 65T but not comfortable. I bought some SpinFit tips to replace the stock tips and comfort was better but sound quality was much worse. I gave these to my wife as I bought the gold versions on sale and she needed earbuds for her Android.<br/><br/>JBL Live Pro 2<br/>I got these on sale. ANC was very good. However fit reminded me of the Tribit FlyBuds C1. I could always tell they were in my ears and they felt like they were going to fall out. I also gave these to my wife and she now uses these instead of the Jabra Elite 75T earbuds.<br/><br/>Samsung Galaxy Buds2 Pro<br/>These are very good. Very light. Whatever material they make them with doesn't irritate my ears like it does for a good amount of people. ANC is pretty good. Not near as good as the Sony's but still good. Sound quality good. I could wear these for hours without issue.<br/><br/>LG Tone Free T90<br/>Finally, the review for the product I'm leaving the review for. The ANC in these is worse than the Buds2 Pro and definitely worse than the Sony's. I'd say they are about on par for the JBL Live Pro 2 for ANC. The case is great. I like the light feature to zap the earbuds between usage. Comfort these are the best for closed ear. Comfort for open ear goes to the Tribit FlyBuds C2.<br/><br/>End of the day when I want closed ear experience, I reach for the LG Tone Free T90 earbuds.<br/>If I am working (working from home) and want the best ANC, I reach for the Sony WF-1000XM4 earbuds.<br/>If I want open ear experience I reach for the Tribit FlyBuds C2.<br/>If I want the smallest earbuds that don't make it obvious I have earbuds in, I reach for the Samsung Galaxy Buds2 Pro.<br/><br/>Hope this helped someone.</span>

<span>UPDATE I:<br/>Another Firmware release has addressed the Transparency Mode to make it sound almost as if there's no buds in your ears.  Not super hearing, but very natural.  I now rate the Transparency mode at 9/10<br/>..<br/>UPDATE II:<br/>I finally got an email from Soundcore after a 10 day wait.  However, they said had sent me two previous emails in response to my initial email and a follow-up.  Someone online mentioned they had all Soundcore's email get sent to the Spam folder.  I checked mine and there they were!  I let Soundcore know and they admitted they were working on a solution.  That seems to work OK now, at least for me.  Soundcore got me new buds within 4 business days of me getting that last email and a postage paid USPS label to return the old ones for investigation.  I now rate Soundcore Warranty support at 10/10<br/>..<br/>UPDATE III:<br/>SINGLE BUD USE: 7/10<br/>While I do not typically use one earbud, if you do you'll find the functionality becomes minimal.  The app limits itself to just the left or right bud control customization and that's it.  No ANC or Transparency modes.<br/>  It sounds like the bud does go into Mono mode.  The remaining customizations are to choose for the single, double, triple and tap / hold controls either Play/pause, Next, Previous Vol +/- and Voice assistant.<br/>I would have liked for ANC to be available in the remaining bud, but I understand Soundcore's logic<br/>...<br/>UPDATE IV:<br/>I found the frequency response for the L3P online and it's clear why these are so bright at the top end and need taming.  Fortunately the treble reproduction is so good that you can use the response to get the excellent clarity without being too harsh.  After several weeks of listening to these and comparing to other BT buds and wired IEM's I altered my EQ setting to get the best clarity and bass for all genres.  I've uploaded that in place of my original.  These are still the best value with the best sound, even compared with Sennheiser MTW2 and the Sony XM3 IMHO.<br/>...<br/>...<br/>ORIGINAL REVIEW:<br/>TLDR warning!<br/>I’m an ‘audiophile’, but only in the sense that I ‘love’ to listen to all genres of ‘high-quality music/sound’ files with Bluetooth earbuds in a quiet, dark room and enjoy the musical arrangements as the producer intended.  I also listen to music when working hard in the garden or the house!  I have earbuds in my ears for hours every day.<br/>I’ve tried many TWS earbuds over the last few months and they all have their strengths and weaknesses, but none hit all the bars, whether it be fit, comfort, sound quality, app customization, retention, ANC modes, price, value for money, warranty support, etc.  You always have to choose what’s most important to you and go with the buds that meet those criteria.  Trouble is, everyone is different and what suits your ears and hearing may be completely the opposite for someone else.  So, this review is for my ears and may be the same for you, but maybe not.<br/>I’ve had these L3P’s for over two weeks, having bought them the day they launched and having watched the overblown YT video hype released the morning of that launch.  I specifically bought Prime ‘Free Return’ buds as the reviews sounded too good to be true and it was interesting that Soundcore sent out so much free product to all the reviewers.  There was a clear marketing strategy in play!<br/>As it turns out, the hype was 75% true IMHO.<br/>CASE 7/10 :<br/>The sliding lid and overall case shape is a unique design but doesn’t suit my dry hands.  It’s easily dropped.  I also struggle with knowing which direction to slide the lid as the Soundcore logo is not intuitive to me.  There is a ledge at the front of the lid, but easily missed.  The earbuds also fit in an odd orientation and it takes a while to learn how best to drop them in quickly.  The magnets are strong enough and I can use my fingertip on the wing to get the buds out of the case, whereas my SoundPEATS Air 3 are almost impossible to get out of their case!  To me though it’s just a case.  I don’t care as long as it fits in a pocket.<br/>FIT  9/10 :<br/>I’ve not used earbuds with wings before. My ear canals point upwards into my head, so stem style buds don’t work for me, unless the stems are pointed up at 11 and 1 o’clock, as I discovered with the Edifier Neobuds Pro.  My button style buds, like the SoundPEATS H1, typically fit nice and deep in my ear canals with smaller tips and only touch my ears via the tips.  I struggle if the design doesn’t allow for the deep insertion to lock the buds in place.<br/>The L3P is not a deep insertion design.  So, the tip must seal and lock into the outer ear for me.  The largest of the L3P wings aren’t actually big enough for my ears.  They don’t reach the cartilage when the bud is in the attitude that Soundcore suggests.  After much experience of loosening with many combos, I finally found the right combination.  Actually, my ears require different combos of wing and tip left and right, but I found a smaller wing and bigger tip worked best, with the buds angled almost horizontally in my ear.  Now I have a pair that is comfortable for more than 5 hours, or when the battery runs out (see below about that!).  Consequently, these are probably the most comfortable buds I’ve used.<br/>TOUCH CONTROLS 9/10 :<br/>I MUST, MUST, MUST have volume control on any ear buds, but I also look for total control as a secondary requirement.  These have it all, similar to the SoundPEATS products.  1 tap, 2 taps, 3 taps, tap and hold.  Each earbud can be set up with whatever function you want.  Also, you can disable each individually if you wish.  I found adjusting the buds a lot in the early days kept changing the single tap volume I’d set up.  I disabled 1-tap functionality and solved that problem!<br/>My configuration is…<br/>1-Tap: disabled<br/>2-Tap: Left Volume down, Right Volume up<br/>Tap and Hold: Left ANC/Transparency/Normal mode, Right Pause/Play<br/>3-Tap: Left Previous track/Restart track, Right Next Track<br/>The touch controls do need some work.  Once you get used to the speed of taps for multiples, the controls work almost flawlessly.  I have dry hands and sometimes, the touch doesn’t register.  Only 1 in 10 times maybe though.  The real problem is the feedback timing… touch, volume changes, beeps sound.  I’d much rather have… touch, beeps, volume change.<br/>Also, the three ANC modes are each indicated by a different tone.  While you learn which is which over time, when any music is playing, it can be difficult to hear and know which tone sounded and hence which mode you selected.  A voice prompt would solve that issue in a heartbeat<br/>BATTERY LIFE 6/10 :<br/>Battery life is not really an issue for me but could be for those who use their buds at work during the whole day.  I haven’t checked the ANC off, LDAC off maximum battery life.  I have run to almost dead with ANC/Transparency mode on, LDAC off and I got just under 6 hours.  With ANC mode on and LDAC on I got under 4 hours!  Considering the size of the buds, you’d think they could fit a larger capacity battery in there.<br/>APP FUNCTIONALITY/CUSTOMIZATION 10/10 :<br/>This is one of the main attractions for the L3P.  You won’t get a more featured app than Sony’s, but this pretty much beats all in this price range and above.  The Sennheiser Momentum TW 2 app is pretty good but doesn’t have the HearID technology or the number of EQ sliders/presets.  I had BT connection issues with the MTW2 and the app.  The L3P is flawless.  It connects every time I open the app.  Firmware updates are pretty fast (just a handful of minutes) compared with the 50 mins for the MTW2!  The EQ customization capability is what saves the L3P (see below for that).<br/>What I would like to see is an option to pause music when selecting Transparency.  Very often, I only need Transparency when I need to talk with someone and I have to make two ‘Tap and Hold’ actions to get there.<br/>ANC  9/10, TRANSPARENCY 6/10 (See Update above) :<br/>To my ears, the ANC is very good.  Of course, the seal in your ears is absolutely critical and that gives a lot of passive noise cancellation also.  Sometimes, I have to insert the buds a couple times to get the seal to work correctly.  I don’t really have an issue with cabin pressure.  So, the adaptive ANC isn’t needed and I like a STRONG manual ANC setting.  I would say the ANC is on par with the Edifier Neobuds Pro, which claims a &gt; 40dB reduction.  Certainly, better than the SoundPEATS T2, but not as good as the Sony XM4.  The sounds you hear are in the upper frequency range with few mids left.  I have used these with my garden rototiller and only needed to bump up the volume by one click.  For mowing though, I add my ANC Q30 over the ear headphones over the top of the L3P with ANC, so I don’t need to bump up the volume at all.  I also use ANC when eating as it reduces the conducted sounds in your head!  There’s no significant ANC hiss with the L3P.  MY MTW2’s hissed all the time in any mode!  Normal mode has a deep bass rumble, which is from inside my head.  ANC eliminates that, which is why I often use it even in quiet places.<br/>I did find I got a better ANC performance using a NY street sound at full volume on my computer speakers during the HearID ANC testing.  Using airplane cabin noise, brown noise or my rototiller, the resulting ANC didn’t seem as good.<br/>Transparency mode works but is still reducing the background noise. You don’t have super hearing, or even normal hearing.  I tried it in my truck and Transparency muted the noise level a lot over no earbuds . It works OK for a conversation and you can hear your own voice, but just a little, but it could be better.  My MTW2 sounded like I had no buds in at all.<br/>The Vocal Mode and Wind Noise Reduction options don’t seem to do much.<br/>CALL QUALITY TBD :<br/>I have yet to use these on any calls.  I will update the review when I have.<br/>SOUND QUALITY - out of the box 1/10, with EQ customization 8.5/10 :<br/>Here’s where the reviewers went wrong IMHO.  To be fair, some actually mentioned the highs were a little too sibilant and very subtly mentioned that app EQ customization will counter that, but most said these buds sounded awesome as-is.  NO, THEY DO NOT!  Out of the box, I found the sound quality was incredibly thin, sibilant in the extreme and harsh on the ears.  These reminded me of the Edifier NB2 and Neobuds Pro sound profiles, but much worse. The former had no app support to adjust the sound and immediately got returned.  The Neobuds could be tamed nicely, but I couldn’t get the stem style to seal reliably.<br/>I spent several days going through my 70-plus Earbud Test Tracks playlist on Amazon Music, trying to find one EQ that would work for all. Eventually I found it.  It’s funny that when I went back though the Soundcore presets, I found the DEEP preset was closest to my custom EQ, though I’d bumped up the highs just a little, reduced the lows and bumped up the mids a lot.  Actually, using the HearID test (which, for me, doesn’t do anything but boost the sibilant highs even more) and then adding that on top of the DEEP preset was actually close to my liking, but still too sparkly and thin.  I can see it would work if you have hearing issues at particular frequencies. I’m just topped out at 14kHz and above and fine with all the others.<br/>For my ears, my custom EQ now produces a crisp, clear full sound with punchy bass.  It’s a joy to listen to music with these.  Vocals are still a little thinner than I’d like, but I’ve found my ears can adapt to the sound profiles of buds over several hours and I get used them.  Some tracks are also ‘thin’ by design, like with many ABBA songs, so you have to choose songs accordingly when adjusting the EQ.  The 6.4 kHz slider is the one that really makes the highs sound harsh.<br/>Interestingly, my Soundcore Q30 over the ear headphones also have a similar bright and thin signature sound without any EQ adjustment.  Must be a Soundcore thing.<br/>Out of the box, I really like my SoundPEATS H1 as it has deep bass and great clarity.  The highs could be a little more forward, but I’m waiting on an app from SoundPEATS to address that with a custom EQ.  I now actually prefer the L3P, though still use my H1 for Heavy Metal, when I desire a dose of overly thumpy sub-woofer Kick Drum beat.  The L3P has good bass, but the H1 has more.  Volume-wise the L3P are loud enough for anyone, but perhaps not as loud as the H1.  I disable Absolute volume in Developer Options to get finer control over the volume.  Some songs sound better if the volume is reduced or increased by a click or two.<br/>LDAC support was added with the first firmware update.  To be honest, I don’t use it.  My ears can’t hear above 14kHZ anyway and I’ve tried some online tests to compare Hi Res tracks to others and like most people, I can’t distinguish the Hi Res files, other than by pure chance.  The L3P still sound great without.  There’s much hype relating to Hi Res and audio quality, as well as LDAC versus aptX.  Go Google it.  aptX is actually more beneficial to me for some strange reason.  Not using LDAC does mean though that I don’t suffer the debilitating battery consumption that others might, which is a plus.<br/>WARRANTY SUPPORT  1/10 - Caveat Emptor! :  (see Update above)<br/>My left earbud has a sound when in ANC/Transparency mode only, like an electrostatic clicking.  It occurs when I am walking, clicking in time with my steps, or if I touch the edges of the bud then I get multiple clicks.  I’ve seen others online have had the same issue.  I emailed Soundcore almost two weeks ago and since with no response.  I also sent a FEEDBACK message via the app – nada!  Soundcore on FB said just send us an email!  I’ve had Tribit and Taotronics issues and received new buds in less than a week total!  There will always be issues and if the company doesn’t support you, that is going to cost you.<br/>CONCLUSION :  Initially, I thought I’d be returning these as the sound and fit were intolerable out of the box.  However, working with them over many days and hours, I found they can be made to sound and fit great.<br/>Yes, there’s a lot of marketing hype associated with the L3P, but fundamentally, they are excellent value for money at $170.  You will not, as of right now, find a better value for features, app support and sound quality.  Warranty support is debatable as of right now for me, but Amazon will come to my rescue until Jan 31, 2022, if not Soundcore!<br/>Soundcore has indeed shaken up the $150-$300 market for earbuds with the Liberty 3 Pro.<br/>I hope this LONG review helps you with your purchase decisions.<br/><br/>Check out my Earbud test tracks playlist on Amazon Music:<br/>https://music.amazon.com/user-playlists/6c1a03929ed947ab82cc33db24d7c001sune?ref=dm_sh_I4ZRJmh4tIHTtEUHGvvCYkvPi</span>

<span>I love these earbuds. I am not sure if I have strangely shaped ears but I've tried so many different types of earbuds and the only ones that worked for me were the Galaxy Buds+. However, I've lost maybe 3 or 4 pairs of those and they no longer manufacture them so I've had to go hunting.<br/><br/>I've tried every Samsung earbud offering, JBL's, Sony's, Apple Airpods, none of them worked well for me or fit in my ear nicely. I read several reviews ranting and raving about these earbuds and I especially paid attention to those claiming that these were better than the Galaxy Buds+.<br/><br/>The packaging was on another level. Comparable to what you'd expect from Apple except even better. These come with 4 sets of tips so there's no room for error in terms of sizing. The buds themselves are incredibly lightweight even though they appear larger in the photos. The case is unbelievably cool. It illuminates your dirty earwaxed up earbuds but this serves as a reminder to keep them clean. I've never really had any trouble with the case other than the constant desire to continuously open and close them because it is very satisfying.<br/><br/>The sound quality is great, I think the microphone isn't great but I've only taken a few calls on it). Bass is good, you can apply a custom EQ as well.<br/><br/>I docked a star because one of the earbuds is unable to hold a charge. I will be using them both and after 1 hour, one earbud is at like 90% and the other is asking me to put it back on the charger. I tried cleaning it and everything and can't get it to charge properly again. Other than this one issue, they've been great. I'll just have to buy another pair I guess.</span>

<span>First, let's get the battery out of the way. I've only had these a week, and my internal jury is still out on battery life. I not unhappy, yet, but I could be.<br/><br/>Next, you should know that I am an Anker fan. And the reason will become evident in a moment.<br/><br/>I need to be able to connect to two devices at once. I have tried several others, including ones made by Jabra, Plantronics, etc. And I have a very difficult time with earbuds. So, I also need flexibility when it comes to fit. Oh, and I can't stand things in my ears to begin with.<br/><br/>Fit<br/>The Liberty 3 Pro's do not feel like they are in my ears and I can wear them for hours without having to adjust them. Read that again. There's no hyperbole in that statement. Seriously, hours on Zoom and the phone without having to even tweak the fit.<br/><br/>Even the way you put them in your ears in unique in all the others I've ever tried. You don't push them in at all, you place against your ear and lightly twist backwards. And they seat perfectly. (You can test your for in the app.)<br/><br/>There may be others out there that fit like this, but I haven't found one.<br/><br/>Sound<br/>The Soundcore app is as good as you will find. The obligatory fit test, sounds profiles, you know, standard stuff. But, here again, Anker goes above and beyond.<br/><br/>The HearID sound test is amazing. I use the word amazing because it has solved a problem that I've had for years, my hearing is really bad and I am forever tweaking my equalizer settings to try to get what I know I should be hearing. Well, let me tell you something. I hear every note. I have compared the settings Soundcore created for me against all of the professional profiles included with the app, and it isn't even close. Anker dusts them. Again, there may be others out there, but I haven't found one.<br/><br/>Customizable buttons<br/>Anker sets thre default for tapping once to do nothing. You can change this, of course, but why would you? The mere act of scratching an itch can set it off, and in others out usually does. But not here. Customize these buttons to your heart's content.<br/><br/>Design<br/>Here is the crux of it all. Design. I must have found Anker by accident at some point, not paying to much attention, but it wasn't long untili realized that, when it came to products they make, the ones with which I was consistently impressed were made by Anker.<br/><br/>And I mean impressed. In every case, batteries, chargers, webcams (singularly, the best I've ever used), power strips - you name it, these designers are something else. Instead of thinking, "Why the heck did they design this to..." you will be thinking, "Holy ergonomics, Batman, they get it."<br/><br/>I am rarely loyal to a brand for much reason at all. Think Starbucks; I can't stand Dunkin'coffee. But Anker? I will go to them first everytime because they design really, really well. The device, the app, the whole package. Now you know why I'm a fan.</span>

<span>I work as a mechanic and needed something to replace my trusty Samsung Buds+ after they took a bath in oil. After searching around these were the answer, though I hadn't heard of Soundcore before the brand certainly delivered. My bay neighbor has a Motion Boom speaker and the quality of the sound and the volume it produces is insane! Now if only he could play something besides country music all day. Which is where these earbuds come in. Out of the box, its nothing too special, though it definitely is better than most. The real magic is when you start to use the app. The ANC is very nice, definitely keeps the shop noise to next to nothing besides maybe the odd tick of the industrial AC blower from time to time, and when I take off the buds  its feels like being hit by a dubstep concert by how loud the shop actually is. Normal mode is fine, the silicone tips do a fine job on their own at noise reduction. Transparency mode is okay, though I do find that I can hear people just fine if I just stop my music while using ANC. The controls are fully customizable though I only use the left earpod for music control and the right for volume control. I wish there was a way to disable switching modes through the buds, but its not the end of the world. They also have a mapping mode in the app that maps out your hearing space (I think that's what its called, I work on cars, not ears lol) and using that really makes the sound stand out over other buds.<br/><br/>The major downside to these buds is really no fault of their own, I don't think any other buds can improve on them at this stage in the game, is the fact that the battery life while using LDAC is pitiful. I can maybe get 2.5 hours out of them before needing to charge them up again, which is a plus to the buds, it will go from zero to full in only 30 minutes but each day I do find myself needing to charge them up 3 times during my 10 hour shift. The case battery life is actually fairly nice, I can charge the buds up about 3-5 times before the case fully dies. Another con is the charging contacts. ANY grime on them and the buds will not charge, which when you're a mechanic, grime is the name of the game. Speaking of grime, another con is the way the ear wings are secured to the bud. As long as you're not a slob, the wings hold just fine, but if you get ANY oil on the silicone, they lose their holding strength and will slip around all the time, which leads to improper charging, loose fit, and needing to find new ear wings or using the smaller ones that the box provides for you.<br/><br/>Overall all I do enjoy these buds and since starting to workout have bought another pair (which 3 weeks later got washed with the workout clothes - I really need to stop doing that). I'm up to a total of three pairs bought now and would say that as long as you're not putting them through hell as a mechanic or just a klutz, they'll serve you amazingly for a fairly affordable price.</span>

<span>Went through a lot of Jabra products over the years. I know each individual has there preferences, but I always try new headphones out. Whether it's Sony, Jabra or other companies. I always swing back to Jabra for my go to and for good reason. My first pair of truly wireless earbuds was the Jabra Elite 65t. Worked pretty good, but didn't really have ANC or block out other sounds very well. Still, it was a solid choice when I was mowing my lawn.<br/><br/>Mt first bluetooth for cellphone use was the Jabra Storm. It was great to have something for phone calls, but definitely needed some of the advanced features we all take for granted today. I love stereo and both ears being engaged.<br/><br/>Found a call center job from home &amp; decided to purchase the Jabra 75 Engage. This is by far my most favorite out of this group. I am not a fan of in or on-the-ear, but these were so light weight and comfortable that even though I no longer work that job....I use these for my PC every single day without issue. It has DECT 6.0 for talking around my house anywhere and is perfectly crystal clear for voice and no one even hears anything going on around me (TV, vacuums, etc...).<br/><br/>Even tried the Jabra Evolve2 85 and they are still good and sound better when listening to music, but still the 75 Engage does a much better job. The 75 Engage also stays better connected. Not sure why, but it just does.<br/><br/>So as you can see, I have everything in almost every category concerning a Jabra headset.<br/><br/>Now to the real review. The Jabra Elite 7 Pro. I do not use in-the-ear earbuds that often, but they are the only way I can take phone calls or listen to music while I mow the lawn, which is at least every other day in the Summer. It does a great job with the sound app to cancel out noise and I look forward to taking a call while mowing to see how the bone conduction is working and sounds for the people on the other end of the call. So far, it works very well for noise cancellation. No problems with people hearing me or sounding muffled. Gotta say, these are worth the money when they are on sale. There are by no means cheap for retail price, but wait for the sales and I say pick them up.<br/><br/>Last is I even bought a pair of Jabra Elite 7 Active for the wife and I will say they feel more comfortable than mine fitting wise, but the ones we received were faulty. Called Jabra directly and their technical support is top notch. I could have called Amazon and still received a new pair, but....Lately I've been calling directly to see if the results are better or worse. Jabra did not disappoint. I didn't have to send the defective ones back either, but they sent a new pair ASAP. I know Amazon would have said upon return, they would send a new pair, but I like Jabra's style better. Just snap a few picks and they sent me one within 2 days time. Very satisfied and will most likely be a fan for as long as they produce quality earphones. They may be expensive, but top of the line companies charge a lot &amp; it doesn't matter who they are. Sony, Jabra, name a few major brands &amp; they are all over $130. I implore people to try different types and companies, but Jabra has never steered me wrong yet. On top of the great customer service (which is rare nowadays), they make a great combo to deal with.</span>

<span>These headphones are fantastic. I had a pair of Apple Pros before these and I have to say, I’m nearly as satisfied. There are some specific Apple ecosystem features you’ll only get with AirPods, but you’ll also being paying a premium to get. While I do miss those seldom used features, they were nice to have.<br/><br/>However, what I don’t miss is the poor physical controls all AirPods have. These not only have excellent default controls but you can completely customize them if you prefer something else in the excellent Jabra Sound+ app. Being on a call or listening to music can have completely different controls, which is incredibly useful. Not only that, but you can tune these headphones to your preferences in said app by doing a simple hearing test or via the equalizer. Heck, you can even do both for a super personalized setup. You also get several white noise soundscapes in the app which is infinitely better than firing up a streaming service to get.<br/><br/>The few glaring issues I have with these is that when a call is initiated or answered while they’re in my ears, I sound muffled to the person on the other side. If I take one out and reinsert it, the issue gets resolved. I cant stress enough how annoying this is. Also, when using multipoint bluetooth, there can be audio lag. Watching content can be hit or miss if you’re connected to your phone and say your pc at the same time. If I’m using them as headphones on my PC, i disconnect my phone.<br/><br/>Overall, I’ve really really enjoyed my experience with these headphones.</span>

<span>Purchased and reviewed with Firmware 2.2.0.  Owned headset for 48 hours so I'm still learning the nuances.<br/><br/>Pros:<br/>- Audio quality is truly the best I've ever heard from any set of headphones I've tried.  Great bass and natural sound with music.  Amazing.<br/>- Multi-point connection is wonderful.  I would have griped if I had purchased prior to this feature being implemented.  I have connected to both PC and mobile phone.  Works seamlessly.<br/>- Volume control on earbuds (just found out about this after reading manual.  Might have only give 4 stars before knowing vol controls available)<br/>- Hear-through mode so you can hear external noises as needed<br/>- Sound+ software actually adds value to product and not just data mining software loaded on your mobile device<br/>- Fit wonderfully in the ears.  No chance of them coming loose.  I'm currently using the large tips but may go back to medium size after further wear and testing<br/>- Ability to use just one bud instead of both for mono use (phone calls)<br/><br/>Cons:<br/>- Firmware update from original 1.0.0 to 2.2.0 was a bit of a challenge to get uploaded and installed to buds.  Update just refused to begin.  I was pretty disenchanted for the first hour or so because the Sound+ software kept pestering me about the update.  Ultimately, I had to reset buds and case to get the firmware to install.  Follow the reset procedures in the manual if you face the same issue.  I uninstalled and reinstalled the Sound+ software as well but i don't believe that was the resolution.<br/><br/>Side note -  the case does not have to be plugged into the USB charger to apply firmware updates.  Case just has to be charged.<br/><br/>Misc:<br/>- Although call quality appears to be fine, in-ear buds tend to force an echo in your head while speaking.  Always been the flaw with in-ear buds as a whole for me.  Not a Jabra thing, more of a format issue of in-ear buds.  I believe between Hear-Through and using just one bud for calls may rectify most of this issue though.<br/>- Jabra Direct software on my PC keeps trying to install Firmware V 1.0.0 for some odd reason.  More of a Jabra software issue than a Jabra 7 Pro bud issue tho so just an FYI if your facing the same.<br/>- Hard to tell if noise cancellations has much of an impact because in-ear buds kinda eliminate noise anyway.  I'm still testing.<br/>- I had originally inserted the buds upside down.  I had to use pictures as a reference for how they properly insert.  Design is not immediately intuitive for proper insertion but once understood makes sound quality superb.<br/><br/>Overall, I'm so impressed with the sound quality and the comfortable but stable fit of these small headphones.  I was torn between  purchasing this model vs Sony's WH-1000XM4 .  I leaned toward Jabra because I own 3 other headsets from them and have been pleased with the quality and life span of all.  Again they do not disappoint.  Firmware 2.2.0 brings these buds firmly into 5 star territory for me.</span>

<span>For the last few years, I've been using traditional wired earbud headphones when commuting, and Bose Quiet Comfort II noise-cancelling headphones when I travel. I can't really use the Apple ear buds because they just don't fit or stay in my ears at all. I used to use a Jabra bluetooth headset and I loved it, so I bought these Jabra ear buds. No regrets! I've been using them for a few months now and I love them, too!<br/><br/>The sound quality when listening to music is excellent and rich and seems to fill my entire head. The microphone is equally high quality and calls are crystal clear. The earbuds fit into my small ears perfectly and comfortably (this never happens) and don't budge. It wasn't until I was getting the earbuds set up with my phone that I found out the sound is customized to the individual user's hearing, which I appreciate as I have some hearing loss in one ear. The noise cancellation is every bit as good as on my Bose over-ear headphones. The earbuds hold a charge for a very long time and recharge quickly. There is nothing about these I don't love. Money well spent!</span>

<span>The features on this tws iem are the best in class:<br/><br/>-Skin-touch controls so you're not accidentally pressing with pillows, or having to push hard on your ears. The controls are definitely the best of any tws I've ever used, and this should be the new standard in the industry. Swipe for volume, tap for calls/play, double tap for skip/hang up, and long press to swap between anc/transparency.<br/><br/>-"Hello Google" works better on these than any other tws I've used, for whatever reason.<br/><br/>-Switch only between anc and transparency modes, so you don't need to wait for slow transitions.<br/><br/>-Ultra lightweight, has no mass so it can't ever gain momentum to fall out of your ears. Plus, extremely comfortable.<br/><br/>-Great battery life compared to others. At the start of my 10hr work day to the end I only need to put them in the charging case for about 5 minutes one time. They recharge FAST.<br/><br/>-Strong signal never has dicey connection. I can go about 60 feet away from my phone with these and not lose signal at all. (Any other tws bud is like 10feet.)<br/><br/>The ANC and transparency modes-<br/>The ANC is interesting, because they're a pretty "open" iem so when the battery is dead they let in a lot of the world around you.. but they do a good job canceling noise coming in regardless of low passive isolation. It's usually not as good as a strong earplug, or an ear protection over an iem, but it is still extremely nice.<br/>It tends to drown out only the low end of some sounds, like if a white noise is playing you'll still hear all of the high pitch portion. This kind of makes sounds more annoying sometimes rather than making them less annoying even when they're overall lower volume.<br/><br/>Transparency mode is super nice, but it doesn't allow you to change the strength of this mode as some other manufacturers do. Google did a good job making it sound natural but without volume control it doesn't do a good enough job of allowing you to hear as well as without them in. Things are still just slightly too quiet with this mode on.<br/><br/>Mic and call quality, BT delays-<br/>The mics sound fantastic. Listening back to myself sounds incredible. Hardly any compression. Still picks up lots of outside noise but not as bad as most tws.<br/>Despite the amazing microphone(s), calls have the nefariously annoying delay. Both when you hear someone and when you speak. Enough to where people notice..<br/><br/>This delay is also present when gaming and watching videos. YouTube and major video players will add a delay to synch it and it works great but in competitive games it's really bad.<br/><br/>So, even though the BT signal is super strong (and the AAC is a lot less battery intensive! Which is probably the reason they chose it.) If you need a FAST signal then you have to look elsewhere.<br/><br/>Luckily, most of us don't actually need a fast signal and I'd 100% take this minor delay over increased battery usage.<br/><br/>There's a lot more about the features I could say, but in short I love them. If you're just looking for something light and comfortable (seriously, way way way more comfortable than any other tws out there! Very easy to sleep in and wear all day compared to others!) Then these are great..<br/><br/>But.. I must now talk about something very important, and the reason they lose two stars despite all the love I have for them: Sound quality.<br/><br/>GOOGLE YOU NEED TO FIRE SOMEONE OVER THIS. Holy biscuits, talk about some of the worst sounding iems above $30 I've ever heard (I've had a couple hundred..)<br/><br/>There are no highs. These are what is known as "dark." Anything above 10khz is bland sounding.. so anything fun frequency, or with distortion, or anything.. just sounds bad.<br/><br/>They sound okay at first because the bass and mids are alright but there is no balance when you get to the highs. They absolutely ruin any electronic or  post 80's rock. I'd take most gas station buds over these for technical listening.<br/><br/>But, I think that's what Google was going for: a vocal-centric bud for daily function over musical quality.<br/><br/>They nailed the spatial side of audio; the driver placement is perfect for diffuse field and phase generation. And there is even a nice dynamic feeling from bass on the weighty driver.<br/><br/>If only the driver had a bit stronger magnet so it could move a little faster, or maybe it literally just needed to be tuned better.. it's just bad at making high frequency sounds and it totally ruins all critical music listening.<br/><br/>So, overall, I love the set for work. Audiobooks/podcasts/calls/battery/controls/comfort are all top notch 10/10.<br/>But what the heck was Google thinking releasing it with such horrible tuning? Give me 20 minutes with their tuner and they'd have a top of the line product here. It's disgusting what they've done..<br/><br/>Maybe they don't think people actually care about the sound of their music. And honestly, they're probably right.</span>

<span>For years I've suppressed the physical discomfort of external sound not realizing I suffered from Misophonia. And owning a pair of $200 earbuds seemed like a luxury item... until I realized noise ISOLATION was exactly what I needed. Using these for just a few minutes after they arrived, I finally felt the human comfort that maybe the rest of you experience automatically.<br/><br/>I give the sound quality a 4-star because I'm noticing a digital distortion and echo issue during phone conversations after about 2 hours. Battery life is above 50%. To resolve this, I have to unlock my Pixel 6 Pro to reestablish a crystal clear connection.<br/><br/>These are the things I won't be hearing:<br/>-inconsiderate neighbors having nonstop chatter from their door to their car possible at all hours of the day and night<br/>-doors slamming<br/>-the garbage truck<br/>-your screaming children<br/>-you, on your phone, not realizing your one-way conversation disturbs my peace.<br/>-the homeless guy playing his theme song as he walks through my neighborhood shouting at unseen forces<br/>-Emergency vehicle sirens<br/>-the guy who plays his music super loud before, during, and well after parking his car late at night<br/>-and most importantly, the lawn maintenance guys every Monday, Tuesday, Thursday, and Sunday<br/><br/>So, to whoever created the technology to allow for my comfort, a sincere Thank you.</span>

<span>I have a bit of a collections of wireless earbuds. From random Chinese brands, to Sony, as well as the old Pixel Buds 2 (2020). The buds 2 were my favorite earbuds previously despite not having ANC, good battery life, or sounding terribly good (they were just very comfortable to me and while the sound wasn't crisp it wasn't unpleasant when frequency corrected.) They lasted long enough to get me through my early morning shift when I was working retail before.<br/><br/>On to the Pixel Buds Pro: these fix basically everything with the Pixel Buds 2. The ANC is pretty close to my pair of Sony WH-1000XM4s though does have a bit of noise in absolute silence which I suspect can be fixed with a software update.<br/><br/>The sound quality is great and can be made significantly better with some EQing via something like Wavelet. Weirdly the Pixel Buds app does not seem to have an EQ option for these but that's whatever since I wouldn't be using it anyway (I always use Wavelet.)<br/><br/>The fit is good: they're pretty comfortable and I can easily sleep with them in. They don't feel as secure as my buds 2 but they also haven't come loose of fallen out so I'd say that's probably not going to be an issue.<br/><br/>Transparency mode is decent: it amplifies everything slightly so it's doesn't sound accurate but it works when you need it/want it.<br/><br/>The Google assistant with hotword support is also nice to have, as well as the ability to reassign actions on each earbud (for example, holding the left earbud can toggle ANC, while holding the right can activate the assistant.)<br/><br/>So far I haven't had any issues with the battery life but also haven't continuously used them long enough to check that. I think the longest so far was maybe 4-5 hours and they were at around 50% by the time I took them off. Mileage may vary with ANC and assistant hotword detection disabled.<br/><br/>Also, according to a Google blog post, these are getting spatial audio at some point later this year though do not have it yet. I'm excited to see what post-laubch improvements software updates bring which is something Google has always been great at.</span>

<span>I've been a pixel user since the Pixel 3a and really love the google brand. At that time, I wanted to get all the google products so that my pixel could work flawlessly across my tech. I bought the original pixel buds in 2020 but had to return them because the "wings" hurt my ears too much; I have relatively small ears and the design of the wings was uncomfortable. So, when I heard the news that google got rid of the wings for this version, I was really excited. While comfort has improved for this model, I still find that they are still slightly uncomfortable with the tips. As to date, the best earphones for my ears are the classic airpods. I had to give these a 4/5 because of their comfort. I am still debating whether or not I will return these.<br/><br/>EDIT 10/3: I bought the comply premium foam tips for buds and that helped significantly. 4/5 rating still stands, but I can wear for a few hours now before my ears get tired.</span>
