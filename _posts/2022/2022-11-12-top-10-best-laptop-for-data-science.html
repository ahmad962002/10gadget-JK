<div class="slideshow-container">
<blockquote><em><div class="a-row a-spacing-small review-data"><span class="a-size-base review-text review-text-content" data-hook="review-body">
<span>This is my first Chromebook, and I've been using it for two days.  The battery life is amazing so far; it does appear to be 10 hours. Reading the reviews, it seems like a wide range of experiences, and I feel fortunate that mine works well so far.<br/><br/>It was very easy to set up. I saw 11.5 in the description, but the actual display screen is 10 inches. It isn't a touch screen, and the keys are dark gray, not black. This was an impulse purchase after getting a new laptop a few days ago. My 6 year old Dell would work no longer, and I got an expensive gaming laptop. It was my second one, but I was not expecting it to get so hot, with a noisy fan. The battery life is about an hour. To feel more comfortable, I wanted a Chromebook for email, YouTube, and Amazon videos. So, this is doing what I want it to.<br/>I will likely get more used to having no delete key, instead the alt+backspace key is used for that function.  I was surprised when my bookmark bar appeared with bookmarks from 2013 on. I've deleted many of them in the bookmark manager.<br/>My main dissatisfaction is the disappearing vertical scroll bar. In some emails, you can select "view in<br/>browser". I would be more frustrated if I didn't have the laptop available. There might be a fix for that; I haven't researched yet.<br/>I purchased mine when it was 52% off, which is worth it.  Buying electronics is risky. I've been very disappointed in the past, which is why I'm relieved and accepting of the machine I got.<br/>Almost everything has become more expensive, and reasonable expectations seem to be in order. With two days use, I'm not regretting my purchase.</span>

<span>I got a replacement and it's exactly what I wanted! Lightweight and the learning curve isn't so bad if you've never used a chromebook before, it only took me a few days to get used to it. It's very different from a normal computer and only good for light browsing and writing, I also got a large micro sd card for storage since it's barely got any, but I love it!<br/><br/>OLD REVIEW:<br/>The laptop itself is adorable, I love the look and feel of it, but I was either sent a broken computer or it was broken by the postal service handling it too roughly. It booted quickly, at least, so my disappointment was immediate. :(<br/><br/>I've put in for a replacement, so I'll be updating my review once that one arrives in two days.</span>

<span>I was curious about Chromebooks &amp; wanted to give one a shot. I looked this one over, and Alice helped me with questions I had. (She was great BTW).<br/><br/>I'm really enjoying this little Chromebook. It's lightweight, has crazy battery life (about 10 hrs). I'm still learning all that Chromebooks can do, but it was definitely worth the purchase. 2 Thumbs WAY UP! :)</span>

<span>I am one who will buy a product based on reviews and all of the reviews here were giving this chrome book such high praise, I figured it’d be worth a shot.<br/>What did I need? Something slim, lightweight, easy to transport, something with speed and CHEAP.<br/>I was in desperate need of a new laptop b/c mine is a dinosaur, very clunky and sloooow. Being in school is what really got me looking and trying to save up for a MacBook was never going to happen on my student budget. This little Lenovo chrome book is quick, sleek, and slim. And most of all, only $100. No touch screen but the battery life is incredible. I use it a few hours every day and only have to recharge it every 3-4 days. I use this chrome book for Google docs, internet surfing/research and e-mail. With that being said, I’m not using much storage so I can’t speak to that.<br/>GREAT buy as it was everything I needed for an unbeatable price.</span>

<span>I bought a used one and it has been perfect so far. Cold boots in 10 seconds. It weighs half of what my old 12" laptop weighs. The backlit keys are easily readable without turning on any room lights. Battery life is awesome. I love it!<br/><br/>Edit 8/22/2022 - Everything is going great with this laptop. I'm having a little problem with how sensitive the touchpad is. As far as I can tell there's no way to make it less sensitive. Any accidental touch will make something happen that you might not have wanted. I just have to remember to keep my hands away from it when not needed. The keyboard is easy to read at night with the backlight on. During the day it's best to turn the backlight off with the F8 key to get the best readability.<br/><br/>Edit 10/13/2022 - I love it!</span>

<span>While it has a USB-C port, it did NOT come with a USB -C charger--just the big bulky plugin barrel charger. You will need to buy a separate 65W UBC-C charger if you don't want to lug around the traditional brick charger.<br/><br/>Laptop is thin and light, yet feels sturdy. I haven't experienced the fan noise. Can confirm the speakers are very weak--just don't get loud enough. Screen is big (minimum bevel) bright, and crisp. There was some bloatware installed but easily removed. It's almost a blue-grey color. Fingerprint logon is super convenient.<br/><br/>So far so good!  I've only had this a few days but it's been working great for me.</span>

<span>Bought this laptop with some graduation money. I loved the look and features, but I noticed it wouldn't go to sleep when the lid closed.<br/><br/>This is a minor issue but I wasn't going to just "deal with it." I paid almost $1k for this thing, and I needed it to freaking work right. Got the replacement ordered, and after a bit more troubleshooting I discovered that the spacebar was protruding just enough to be pressed when the lid closed.<br/><br/>So in short, I couldn't have fixed it anyway due to it being a hardware issue. Anyways, I've gotten the replacement set up and I'm loving it.<br/><br/>This thing is so light that it doesn't feel like it should have the components it contains (i7-1165G7 w/ Iris Xe IGPU).<br/><br/>It runs Apex legends on medium to low settings with few hiccups, but be sure to put it on a flat surface to account for adequate cooling.<br/><br/>Battery life is incredible due to the Intel Evo energy management system, I haven't stress-tested it yet, but I have a lot of confidence that it won't disappoint.<br/><br/>When I say this thing is snappy, I mean incredibly fast, at almost any task. (hehe, rhymes) The 16GB of 4267MHz LPDDR4X RAM is a major contributor to that speed. The PCI Express NVME SSD feels like it's supercharged and overclocked; it's that fast. And the 1TB capacity gives me ample wiggle room for whatever files or games I might want to store on it.<br/><br/>Camera is an underwhelming 720p pinhole lens, so nothing really to fawn over there.<br/><br/>The fingerprint sensor is super helpful as well. You can use it to sign in to websites as well as the laptop itself.<br/><br/>Overall, very happy with the laptop so far, but I was disappointed that the first one I got was faulty. Points docked, Acer. I would definitely recommend this to someone who needs a powerful laptop that doesn't take up much space.<br/><br/>As an added bonus, it has a pretty snazzy color scheme as well. The subtle green with the bronze/gold accents really goes well together in my opinion. The only downside is that these colors are the only ones available.<br/><br/>Hope to use it for years to come!</span>

<span>This computer seems nice enough out of the box. Easy to set up, runs Windows, etc. I'm sitting there playing a game six days later, and all the sudden a puff of smoke comes out the back. Now I'm sitting here staring at Acer's chat support app. If an agent ever joins the chat, I'll update this review. As of now, it looks like I paid $1,100 for a brick.<br/><br/>UPDATE: It took almost six weeks, but I got the laptop factory-repaired for free, and I have it back. It's a nice laptop for what it costs. By way of illustrating that point, the first thing the Acer support people said to me was "this'll be easier if you just send it back to Amazon. They'll give you a replacement immediately, and we'll repair the unit on the back end." Only problem was, a week after I bought it, the laptop was completely backordered.<br/><br/>From where I sit, this product seems like the kind of thing where you can get a deal for being willing to put in a little elbow grease. The Acer factory maybe needs better QC, but their Tier-2 tech support handled the problem about as well as could have been expected.<br/><br/>If it breaks again I'll update.</span>

<span>I would just like to note that this model only has one RAM slot, not two, as the Q&amp;A answers from Acer have stated. I purchased two 16GB modules on the basis that I would be able to take out the 4GB module and then put the two new ones in, giving me 32GB total. However when you take the back cover off, there is only one RAM slot on the motherboard. I don't mean one FREE ram slot, just one slot, period. It's empty, which means I was able to put one of the 16GB modules in, making for a total of 20GB, which isn't bad, but it's annoying to do your due diligence and read everything you can about a product, including statements from the manufacturer, only to find that the reality is different. My guess is that earlier models did in fact have two RAM slots, but since Amazon mixes models together on the same product page, it can be impossible to know exactly which model someone is talking about. Whatever, it is what it is, just know that this particular model A515-46-R3UB only has a single RAM slot. I don't even know where the other 4GB module is, maybe soldered onto the motherboard elsewhere, but I looked everywhere and I couldn't see any other places to put a second RAM module. I'm not a computer expert by any means, but I am a software developer and I have built my own PC from motherboard up, so I know what a RAM slot looks like. This only has one, so be warned.<br/><br/>The other thing that bugged me about this was the arrangement for inserting a 2.5 hard drive. In my case I wanted to put a 4TB Samsung SSD, which fit just fine into the frame, and then you screw the frame into the case, which is fine. The bad part is the little, itsy bitsy ribbon cable that have to connect the hard drive to the motherboard. First, I had to look up a youtube video to even know what I needed to look for on the motherboard. It's a tiny little slot covered with a white rubber cover, which you lever up, and then slide the end of the ribbon cable into it. The problem is, there's no positivity to the connection, like you have with the larger size regular SATA cables. No "click", because the cable is just a flexible, thin piece of plastic. There's not even any way to really know if it's aligned correctly. So you just fiddle around with it, not knowing if you're damaging the flimsy thing as you try to push it into a slot which gives you zero tactile feedback. After many attempts to insert it, only to feel it lift away without any resistance (meaning it hadn't inserted at all), eventually I got it to "stay", though it wasn't quite straight, that was as good as I could get it. Horrible design, if you ask me. I don't see that they couldn't have made the port a "real" one, there was plenty of height inside the case to be able to accommodate it. But again, whatever.<br/><br/>Finally, I wanted to put Debian on here, since I assumed that the latest version would work with the hardware. Not so much. The Wifi hardware in particular just would not work at all, even with Bullseye. And when I tried putting unstable on there, it stopped dead during install asking me to supply a number of firmware files which appeared to be related to the Wifi hardware, but I couldn't find those files anywhere online. Very frustrating.<br/><br/>Eventually I ended up installing Ubuntu instead, which isn't ideal since I like my development environment to be the same as my server, which is Debian. But I decided to try it, since I know that Ubuntu tends to do a better job with strange hardware drivers. Sure enough, it went without a hitch this time, and the wifi worked.<br/><br/>So now I have an Ubuntu laptop with a 4TB SSD and 20GB RAM, and it seems ok so far, so I'll probably keep it since other options out there seem to have their own issues - either the screen is bad, or the keyboard, or whatever, there's always something. At least this laptop seems to have a nice screen, the keyboard isn't too bad, and 20GB, while not what I wanted, should be enough to do what I want in reality. The webcam seems a little grainy, but I'm not a big webcam user anyway, so.<br/><br/>All in all it's a pretty good deal, if you know what you're going to have to deal with and are willing to fiddle around a bit. The one RAM slot, tiny trashy hard drive cable, and driver issues with Linux (at least the Wifi), everything can be worked around to some extent. I guess it just depends what you are willing to put up with.<br/><br/>I was thinking about posting a photo of the motherboard to show the single RAM slot, but it's all screwed back together now (11 tiny screws) so to be honest I can't be bothered. Just take my word for it, there's just the one RAM slot, not two as all the Q&amp;A seem to say. Be warned.</span>

<span>The Acer Aspire 15 has been a super great laptop. It's probably one of the best tech purchases I have ever made and I'm an IT guy. I paid about $350 USD for this one and am very happy with the purchase. The last time I was searching for a Laptop I returned 5 laptops before I was satisfied so I'm pretty picky. This was for my wife but I use it at night when I'm not in my office sometimes.<br/><br/>Storage &amp; Upgrades: Although it only comes with 128gb SSD &amp; 4gb RAM it's no big deal for about $100 you can upgrade to 20gb RAM and 2tb HDD + 128gb SSD. I love that you can run dual drives. 1 SSD + 1 HDD. I added a 2TB HDD for Data Storage for $50, it came with the bracket in the box, and it didn't void the warranty, like on my LG Gram. The 128gb SSD is functioning as a Boot Drive. I also added a 16gb module for about $50 and now have 20gb RAM. The upgrades were pretty straightforward and you can use normal small screwdrivers.<br/><br/>Performance: It boots up super fast, maybe 10 seconds to reach the sign in screen and 2 seconds to log in. Web pages and programs load quickly. We use it for Web browsing, Word, PowerPoint &amp; Excel. I'm not doing video editing or high performance gaming on this but it runs almost as fast as my i5 LG Gram that cost $1500 with all SSD drives. It doesn't get too warm but we do have it on a fan stand, but I don't usually plug it in because for some reason the USB keeps powering the fan after it powers down, and I can't find a BIOS setting to turn this off. I notice that it gets a little warm when sitting directly on a table. I usually can't hear the fan at all. Sometimes you can hear it kick on when you open up 15 tabs and a bunch of apps.<br/><br/>Screen: The screen is really nice too. It's 1080 Full HD so you don't see the pixels like on a normal 15" Standard HD screen. I think it's average brightness but we use it indoors so it's plenty bright for our needs.<br/><br/>Keyboard: I love the Keyboard, it's much better than the keyboard on my LG Gram, and just as good as the best keyboards I have tested in BestBuy from Lenovo. It's wonderful to type on. It's backlit as well so that's nice plus. And I love the Number Pad, even though the number pad is a little skinner than the other keys.<br/><br/>Fingerprint ID: It's super fast and I didn't know how much I would love it!<br/><br/>Speakers: The speakers are fine. They are loud enough to watch YouTube videos and the news but it won't compete with a home stereo system.<br/><br/>Ports: It has plenty of full size ports: 3 USB, 1 USB C, 1 Full HDMI a headphone jack and even a RJ-45 Ethernet Port! I hate dongles so it's nice that you don't need one for this laptop. I would have liked to see a MicroSD reader but my wife doesn't SD Cards it so it's no big deal for her.<br/><br/>Window 11: It comes with Windows 11s but is very easy to switch to standard Windows 11. I was a little concerned about this and it almost made me not go for this laptop. But it's no big deal, as soon as you try to install something "non Microsoft" like Google Chrome it says something like, "If you want to install non-Microsoft software, you have to switch to full Windows 11 mode. Are you sure? You will loose all the exclusive Microsoft Security with Windows 11s Mode." But you just click, "Yes" and it switches, it may require a reboot but I can't remember.<br/><br/>Battery: The battery is average. We usually leave it plugged in on the desk but the few times that we have used it without a battery we used it for a few hours and it remained at 70% battery. Windows 11 doesn't estimate the time remaining so I really don't know for sure how long it would last. I'd guess it would go from 100% to 10% in about 5-6 hours for Netflix, YouTube or web browsing or MS Office apps.<br/><br/>Again, I really love this laptop. I keep telling my wife how impressed I am with the performance, storage upgrade options, keyboard, screen, etc. She doesn't really care that much as long as it works fast and does what she wants so I decided I had to tell all of you Amazon people that this is a great laptop for 95% of normal people who just want something that works well and is a good price. I highly recommend the acer aspire 15 and would buy it again, no regrets!</span>

<span>I think for 350-400 this laptop is probably one of the best you could find, especially considering it's size. I'm not sure how people are having trouble switching out of S mode, but I did it in literal seconds (for free, no clue how people are getting messages they have to pay) after I was able to access the desktop so that's a complete non-issue. It also looks a bit more expensive than it is which is cool I guess.<br/><br/>Cons:<br/>The audio is good but rather quiet, there's oddly no light indicator on the caps lock, and the buttons to raise/lower the brightness have their icons swapped?<br/>Hard drive is miniscule, I had 85 GB free in total. At least it is a SSD. You can find external hard drives of any size for cheap nowadays so this isn't an issue, also given that the computer has 3 USB ports, just be aware of it going in.</span>

<span>Only has one ram slot and a soldered on 4gb of ram so can upgrade enough and the hard drive can be added I like the ability to choose your own hard drive size to put in instead of being stuck with a low amount... Less ewaste.  Also speaking of the hard drive I had read a review about the hard drive ribbon cable connector you cannot lift up you have to unscrew the Wi-Fi chip to be able to lift a little tab for the hard drive ribbon cable see picture</span>

<span>After many years of using actual netbooks, I was in the market for something the same shape and size after they discontinued the term. I wanted something that was somewhat future proof and wouldn't crap out after a few windows updates like all of my previous models.<br/><br/>I saw a video review (it is posted on here and elsewhere) and knew this was the netbook for me. The NVME expansion slot plus the SD card reader made this thing elite compared to other models. I popped a 512GB in here and am able to install old video games, my programs, and even a virtual machine or two.<br/><br/>Windows 10 runs flawlessly on this. Bootup times are a breeze. Program loading times can be a bit slow compared to a much higher end model, but for something as light as this, it is incredible how responsive this little engine that can is.<br/><br/>As everyone will tell you, this thing does not game well. It will play games of yesteryear which is exactly what I bought it for, but of course I tested things like Left4Dead, Tower Unite, and a few others. Left4dead barely runs on here even at lowest settings. Farm Together needs render quality dropped to the bare minimum. I was actually expecting it to run some UT3 engine and Source Engine games at minimal settings, but it failed horribly. I also noticed in the bios, there is not much wiggle room to throw more memory at the GPU and I think that is where is struggles outside of the already known single channel memory flaw. So if you are looking for the casual game of Simcity 2000 or Roller Coast Tycoon, this can handle it, just don't expect to play anything after the 1990s.<br/><br/>I have not made the jump to Windows 11 yet and am a little weary because of the 4GB limitation, but it is constantly reminding me to upgrade so I know that it is fully 11 ready for future proofing.<br/><br/>The numpad seems like a cool idea at first, but I had trouble getting the hang of it and often forget it is even there. I think this is a great feature and may serve a college student who isn't used to traditional trackpads very well. My old self is just so used to a traditional laptop, I need to train myself to utilize it.<br/><br/>I love this netbook and would definitely buy another one if there is an upgraded model in the future when this one starts showing age. I highly recommend it to anyone who wants something small with decent storage and great response times.</span>

<span>I had a previous version of this laptop before so after four years I decided to get a replacement and gift my old one to a friend.  The laptop works great just like the last one.  It's perfect for basic work like office suites and surfing the web,  It is lightweight and I take it with me when living abroad.  The only issue I have with it is that even though I have the power management set to shut entirely down with either the lid closed or pressing the power button, The battery isn't holding the charge.  I can fully charge it, shut down and unplug it; in about three days, it will be about 35 percent battery life.  However, I don't know if its MS 11 or the Hardware itself.  Other than that, I love the Asus product line and this little laptop. Just don't expect it to be fully charged if you leave it unplugged after a few days.</span>

<span>You might think that only 4 gb for a Windows 10 laptop that cant expand the ram is a bad idea... Well, I've found this small laptop is actually fine, even quick for internet browsing, email, word processing and watching videos.  Sure, the keyboard is smaller, but even with large hands, I had no trouble typing...<br/><br/> Obviously, this is not a good choice for gaming or video editing work.  Battery life is very good for the intended basic uses; not Apple Ipad good;  but should give you at least 6+ hours for the basics...<br/><br/> It DOES have a micro SD slot, in addition to the 2 USB ports.<br/><br/>While you can't expand the RAM, you can also expand the storage with an internal NVME stick.<br/><br/>This is a great idea as it noticeably speeds up the computer if you make it the boot drive.  I added a 500GB Samsung 980 NVME stick and am very pleased with the results.<br/><br/>Having read about issues with the Samsung Magician cloning software, and difficulties in making a boot drive change work well on this laptop; let me tell you what worked well for me...<br/><br/>Ordered the Samsung nvme stick, along with a $15 external USB enclosure for this type of chewing gum stick size drive. Downloaded the free version of Easeus Partition Master software to clone the built in Asus L210 drive. Loaded the new stick in the external drive enclosure, connected the drive with a USB cable to a USB slot on the Asus, and followed the directions to clone the Asus C drive.  Opened the Asus and inserted the Samsung stick into the open nvme slot. Pressed power button holding down F2 key to get into bios.<br/><br/>Change the boot order to start with the nvme stick. Save and exit. Booting then detected issues with Windows, so choose to download and install a new, clean copy of Windows 10.  ( If you do this right after you have received the Asus, then you don't have any reason to save data or settings on this Windows clean install.  You don't yet have any personal data to save.)  When Windows is finished with the reinstall, make sure to do your windows updates.<br/><br/>After that is done, use Disk management tool to reformat the original drive,  and resize the partitions on the new nvme drive to what is available.<br/><br/>Now your little, inexpensive laptop is faster, with plenty of drive space.  Certainly one of the better values you can get in a very portable size, great for traveling when you may not want to carry a larger, more expensive laptop.  Screen quality is very good, and the Asus has a full size hdmi out for easy video sharing.  Definitely recommended for the price point and its intended use.</span>

<span>I bought this machine because I was looking for a small, inexpensive machine with good battery life to use for writing and media consumption when travelling, without having to worry much about it being damaged, broken or stolen.<br/><br/>This laptop comes with a 64GB eMMC disk which is small and not very fast. I bought an M.2 SSD to add to this laptop as the primary disk (I bought a Western Digital SN550 SSD). To add the M.2 SSD, you have to remove the ten screws at the bottom of the laptop (there are two different lengths of screw, so mark the holes with the longer screws when removing). Removing the bottom cover is a bit tricky because it is very tight - start at a corner and insert plastic credit card or similar into the gap, Then pull the credit card around the seam to pop off the clips (the trick is to not push the credit card too far into the seam, or it will get caught. Insert it only a tiny bit into the seam and it will glide easily). Once you have removed the bottom cover the place to insert the SSD is labelled on the motherboard. You just push it in, then add a single screw to secure it. The screw doesn't ship with the SSD usually, but if you need one you can buy a kit for a few dollars - search for "M.2 mounting screws" and you can get a kit with screws and screwdriver in the correct size, which can also be used to remove the case screws.<br/><br/>Once you've added the SSD, it won't appear in windows until you've formatted it in disk manager, which you can open by searching for "disk" in start menu and hitting "create and format hard disk partitions".<br/><br/>Once formatted, you can use it as a regular disk, but for best performance, reinstall windows on the SSD. To do that, create Windows 10 installation media - search google for "Create installation media for Windows" then follow instructions. You'll need a USB drive that's 8GB or bigger.<br/><br/>Once you've created installation media, install Windows on SSD (hit F2 when booting laptop to get into BIOS to select startup disk). Drivers are available from ASUS site (search "asus L210 drivers" then hit "support"). Windows will automatically find the digital license for your machine and activate.<br/><br/>Running on the SSD, performance for the machine is very good considering the price. Processor is fast enough to watch 4K youtube videos, should you wish to. Keyboard is fine-to-good. Touchpad is OK - good considering price. Speakers are not great, but good enough for watching youtube and as good as I would expect for this price and size. There is no backlit keyboard but that's not something I care about. Screen is fine, good for price. Overall build quality feels very good compared to other units in this price range. Machine feels light.<br/><br/>Battery life is excellent - using windows 10 "battery saver" mode (activate by pressing speech bubble in bottom right of task bar then hitting battery save) I routinely get 12 hours or more with normal usage and medium brightness, which is really excellent for the price in my opinion.<br/><br/>If you want a small, cheap machine with very good battery life and decent performance, and you are willing to add the M.2 SSD, this is a great choice.</span>

<span>A fantastic laptop for the low price. The look and design of the laptop is very nice and sleek. The only odd thing about it is the fans on the side pushing all the ports to the middle of the sides. Everything worked out of the box and the MSI Dragon Center is one of the best control centers I've seen among all my previous computers. They keyboard is also very nice. I love the rgb control you have and the presets you can choose from are very satisfying. The laptop has also been very quiet so far. While it has gotten just a little warm, I feel like that's to be expected with literally any gaming laptop on the market so I don't think I can knock it for that, especially when its been minimal.</span>

<span>Needed a new laptop. Old one was outdated. Friend recommended this one. It has everything I need for both school and gaming. The 3060 handles every game I played so far. Haven’t played any crazy big games but for csgo and  league of legends it handled completely fine. Another side I really like is the fact that it’s super light. Definitely not like the old Bulky gaming laptops. Performance can always be better but in the convenience aspect it’s perfect</span>

<span>Not gonna lie, super impressed with this laptop. Was considering an HP Spectre or Galaxy Book Pro, but stumbled across this on here of all places. It had everything i was looking for &amp; more than what I even realized.<br/><br/>Presentation in box was nice. Like how it is packaged in a dust sleeve &amp; even has a dust sleeve in-between screen &amp; keyboard. Major plus mark for that alone.<br/><br/>Upon booting first time &amp; getting initially set up, enjoyed how nice the screen is. IPS is the way to go, ngl. Keyboard light &amp; RGB options are a major upgrade for my use. Selection of apps &amp; programs from the get go are too numerous to mention, but is nice to have plenty of options. After removing what didn't interest me, proceeded with updates, as you should with any device.<br/><br/>This thing seems like Sonic... GOTTA GO FAST!<br/><br/>Dragon Center App has tons of various tweaks &amp; options for things like Keyboard RGB light, Power/ Battery, Performance, etc. Definite plus for that alone. Some people can't stand it, so I'll leave that up to particular preference.<br/><br/>Yes, the fans can he EXTREMELY NOISY... BUT for my particular usage &amp; wants in a laptop, quite a fair trade off. Only way they get THAT noisy, is if you select extreme performance/ cooler boost. A good pair of headphones would drown that noise.<br/><br/>Another surprise, is that you can run android games either through The appropriate MSI app or even Bluestacks... was not aware of when I decided to purchase, but cool nonetheless. I would say remove the MSI App Player &amp; just use true Bluestacks, if you want to mess with Amdroid emulation<br/><br/>With this, I plan on investing in Steam, finally. Not to mention, can't wait to see what this thing can handle, emulation-wise (Can't wait to try Stepmania on this). [Edit/ Update 9/7/21 -Stepmania runs just like arcade Dance Dance Revolution on MAX graphical program settings. Just a little side note, SOME games that have a max refresh rate of 60hz may have graphical issues... I'm specifically mentioning Sonic Adventure &amp; Adcenture 2 for PC being OVERLY FAST. There are workarounds to get said games working perfectly.]<br/><br/>Build seems solid. Got the Gray version &amp; am not disappointed at all by my choice. It has a nice blue tinit to it.<br/><br/>[Update 9/7/21- Dont expect to get a ton of battery use out of this thing. Setting battery saver settings via windows &amp; dragon center to as max as possible &amp; lowering screen brightness might get 6 to 8 hours of battery life, with just normal, no gaming computer use. Thankfully you can calibrate battery when needed to extend the service life of it.] [Another note: if you run demanding thinga in this, it will get hot to hold. My suggestion, buy a GOOD laptop stand with fan cooling. I would suggedt KLIM Ultimate RGB for if you are a gamer that plays less demaning games. Binding of Isaac, Emulation, etc. Said cooler would probably be good for some demanding games too, with Cooler Boost function turned on to help get some extra airflow]<br/><br/>This may be The best "budget" gaming laptop out there atm. Got the 512 GB Model with 16 GB ram &amp; the RTX 3060. Going to eventually go overkill with max ram &amp; a 2 tb Samsung SSD. Can't wait to see what this thing can unleash then... but for now, happy camper!</span>

<span>I have had this a week. So far the laptop is good. Setup took a while between all the configuration settings I wanted and to download all the Windows updates. The one thing that bugs the you-know-what out of me is the pen. The instructions to set it up were worthless because it seems Lenovo has umpteen different versions of it, and of course the one packed with my Lenovo Flex 5 Ryzen 5000 was not listed. US1213 is stamped on the pen, but I can't find anything on that. What is it? A model number? A serial number? So I have no freakin clue how to use it. It would be nice to know, but it's not a deal breaker. Other then that, I'm satisfied at this point.<br/><br/>The keyboard is responsive and easy to use. The feel is solid as a chicklet keyboard. The touch screen functions as expected. The boot-up speed is fast. Fingerprint reader was super fast and easy to set up. My laptop shipped with a USB-C power connector, which was good. The built in privacy shutter is nice. The speakers have been maligned in previous comments, but for the money what can one realistically expect? This is a really good buy! You want better speakers? Lay out more money. Others have denigrated the laptop's plastic case, but again, for the money you get a darn good, solid case. People have said that it bends if you pick it up by the corners or lift the lid by the corners. Well, you're not supposed to do that anyway! If you treat it the way a manufacturer recommends, then follow the recommendations. Don't complain when you don't do what is recommended! For the record I did try to do those things and got NO bending at all. But then I only did it a few times to see if the comments were correct.</span>

<span>I got this laptop for school since my campus is huge and I'm way more mobile than I thought I'd be. If you have to carry a lot of stuff, the laptop can be a little heavy on top of that. I'm a communication design major so I'm using Adobe all the time. While this laptop can run the suite, the battery will die in like 3 hours using one program. I use this to supplement the school computers. On regular use I get like 8 hours (very rough estimate. Its full at the start of the day and I still have like 20% by the end). I don't game a lot anymore but it can run Dead by Daylight. Granted it'll kill your battery in an hour and your fans will be on full blast. If its plugged in and on low detail you can still play lol. Carry your charger all the time just for convenience sake. Its bulky but do it.<br/><br/>I initially didn't care for the 2 in 1 feature but its pretty handy when I'm trying to show people something. The pen uses a AAAA battery which I didn't know was a thing. I don't use it a ton since I already have a Huion but works fine, the pen pressure is good. The keyboard is nice to type on. Lenovos keyboards are half of why I wanted this one, I hate mushy keys.<br/><br/>The glossy screen is a little annoying but you get used to it. If you absolutely can't stand it, there's matte screen protectors. The screen is also only like 250 knits so not great for use in the sun. It gets hot easily. Just updating something on Steam/Adobe will pump the fans on. Propping it up on something helps. If you have one of those laptop fan trays even better. The camera is not great but what laptop has a good one. The fuzzy ass photo is an example shot. For an average user (emails/ Netflix) this will be more than enough. If you're an artist on a budget its a good option.</span>

<span>This is a Great laptop. I first order another Lenovo, which was defective or something. Because it was so new there were no reviews.  I returned it with no problem.  I thought I didn't need such a high grade laptop. So I decided to get this one, and it's almost half the cost. Im not a gamer on PC, but this also comes with entice gamer pluses, including Xbox promotion time. I periodically watch movies mostly pay bills, read and writing docs. For personal use, I am please with laptop. It is fast, smooth has sufficient memory.  Graphics are great, touch screen works great, and so does touch point, even has backlit. It comes with with windows 11 home, Great for me. I transfer all my docs and pdf, photos, music, and some apps. with Lenovo migration assist, so easily through my wifi. I did buy from Microsoft site, and pdf app, so I can edit and sign forms that only cost me 49.00 one time fee for up to "I think" it was 5 different devices. I would difinately recommend this laptop.  I bought it on the lighting deal last week. Loved the price even more. Thumbs up for this laptop.</span>

<span>Overall it is a great machine, although when gaming right at the speaker area get really hot and don't touch that area as you might get a surprise. You wouldn't get burn but you surely would be surprised how hot that gets. The 32GB is good enough for me and I added an extra hard drive to save my media.

<span>This laptop, is light and very ergonomic. I havent had any issues with the heat or noise as reported in some reviews. Yes if the processor really gets busy the fans kick in and the grill between the screen and keypad is way too hot to the touch... But after a month of heavy, graphics work, music, word processing, downloading all at the same time, that only happened once. And again... Not a problem. The keys have a very nice feel and a pleasure the type. Two issues though... When i first got it..<br/>There was no info re getting the rainbow undulating key lights to stop... Was making me sea sick. Eventually figured out, that needed to go to steel series software, and not the MSI centre where control used to be on older models. Secondly, you are goin to have to get a usb hub for this as the ports are very limited. At least a hdmi could have been included. But its all good.</span>

<span>Jack of all trades laptop that does everything pretty well. Ill go over some of the important categories in detail. I did end up returning this laptop for reasons Ill mention but it is a good device overall.<br/><br/>Build Quality -<br/>Build quality is good overall with metal construction and not too much flex on the chassis or lid of the laptop. It has some upgradability with a second, empty m.2 drive slot. Which is pretty nice since you can expand on the original 512gb SSD without having to replace it. The RAM is soldered onto the board and, therefore, cannot be changed. 16GB should be enough for most cases, but again, with them marketing towards creators the option to expand past 16GB may have been nice even if only a single so-dimm slot was accessible like in the Asus g14 for example.<br/><br/>I/O -<br/>I/O is solid for a 14 inch laptop with it housing 2 USB type As, 1 USB 3.2 type C (charging capable), a mic/headphone combo jack, and an HDMI port. Though for a device marketed as a "Creator Laptop" Id have expected either a full size or at least micro sd card reader.<br/><br/>Keyboard/Touch pad -<br/>The keyboard provides a nice typing experience. Though the keys are a little mushy for my liking.<br/>The touch pad is also very solid with a smooth surface and accurate tracking. Could be a little larger possibly but is fine for the size of the laptop.<br/><br/>Battery Life-<br/>Battery life is pretty good for this segment. Could probably find better at a similar price but given the hardware in this laptop it is plenty good I'd say. I was generally reaching around 7-9 hours at 50% brightness and with background apps disabled. Usually while web browsing, watching videos, and coding in Visual Studio. Make sure to turn off one drive syncing though as its on by default and drastically lowers battery life.<br/><br/>Display -<br/>The Display is both a pro and a con for me. It is very bright and color accurate but it is not very good for gaming. Now this is not a gaming laptop so i was not expecting a high refresh rate display or anything along those lines. What I was not expecting was to be so impacted by the high response time of the display. Every game I played experienced ghosting and was generally not very responsive. It ended up being a deal breaker for me as, while I bought this for university primarily, gaming is an important 2nd use case for me. The performance is not the problem as ill touch on shortly, but the screen hinders the gaming experience too heavily for me. This is a subjective opinion as I am sure it wont be a problem for most and it may have to do with the fact that I have always had a high refresh rate display on both laptop and desktop for the past few years but its an issue for me nonetheless.<br/><br/>Performance -<br/>Performance is great for the price and size of the laptop. My model was equipped with the R7 5800u + 3050ti. This combo could handle pretty much any workload I threw at it. I never completely stressed the 8 cores and 16 threads the CPU had to offer but I did not experience slowdown when coding in visual studio or when I had a large amount of chrome tabs open. I am not a content creator but I would imagine this hardware combined with the color accurate display would make it a great fit for any kind of photo or video work, as it should given its advertised towards this use case. For the gaming side, the 3050ti in this thing is only a 40w part but its no slouch. Easily beating out integrated graphics or the underwhelming MX line of dedicated GPUs from Nvidia. There wasnt a single game I tried that was unplayable. Even cyberpunk can hit 60fps with DLSS. The most graphically intensive game I consistently play at the moment is Battlefield V which will run at a steady 60fps on medium or 50-60fps on high with some dips. The 3050ti in here seems to be on par with a full wattage GTX 1650ti while trading some blows here and there from what I have seen. Again, certainly not a gaming laptop, especially given the screen, but it is more than capable of allowing you to play pretty much any game in your library at some level of settings. Pretty impressive for a laptop with this combination of price and portability.<br/><br/>Thermals/Acoustics  -<br/>Thermals are a strong point of this laptop. Unlike full fledged gaming laptops, the 3050ti in here is a bit easier to handle. As such, this laptop running only a single fan. While the CPU can run a little toasty from time to time it will usually spike then drop to a more comfortable operating temperature. Seemingly up to around 95C then settling in the low to mid 80s in my testing. The GPU stays pretty cool at all times, even when being maxed out. Thankfully, due to that single fan, even under load the laptop does not get very loud. I did not test the exact decibel count but its quiet enough to where I could play a game without worrying about putting on headphones as opposed to a traditional gaming laptop where eventually jet engine mode activates. That said, when installing programs and doing some other seemingly mundane tasks that can put a little stress on the CPU, the fans will spike which can be annoying.<br/><br/>Closing Thoughts -<br/>Overall I really liked this machine. It offered good performance, battery life and build quality for a good price. The display ended up being a deal breaker because gaming is too high of a priority for me to compromise in that area. Which this laptop showed me honestly as I was not expecting it to be something I found to be such a problem. All that said, it probably wont be an issue for most and if it sounds like it would be to you Id recommend looking elsewhere.  Otherwise this is a great option for pretty much anyone looking for a good all around device in this price range.</span>

<span>Edit: Updated after spending more time with the laptop.<br/><br/>I ended up buying two of these.  First one was for me, the second one was for my son who is in the military.<br/><br/>I can say that my power brick works fine and the "pigtail" fits into the brick just fine. I think that reviewer was unlucky and got a dud.<br/><br/>RAM is soldered on, so there aren't any upgrades. However, it's low power DDR4 4266, so it's fast and also in dual channel. 16 GB should be enough for most people.<br/><br/>The SSD is a PCIe 3.0 x4, so it's relatively quick. HWinfo64 reports it's also NVMe 1.3, which isn't the latest spec. The SSD itself is made by SK Hynix and performs reasonably well.  There are two M.2 slots inside. Slot 1 is NVMe/SATA. Second is NVMe only. Both slots are PCIe 3.0 as the AMD Ryzen 5000 series only supports PCIe 3.0. If you want to upgrade your storage, don't waste your money on a Gen 4/PCIe 4.0 SSD unless you plan on moving it to a faster computer later.  I recommend the SK Hynix P31 Gold 1 TB for a second drive. I put one in my son's Swift X and it performs very well.<br/><br/>The Wifi is made by Mediatek. I had a lot of issues with this card. It wouldn't connect to my Fios wireless network (it'd connect to the guest network though - go figure). Card was very slow.  I bought an Intel AX210 for my son's laptop and it fixed the problems.  Speed and connectivity is significantly better with an Intel card.<br/><br/>The laptop is a little short on ports, including an Ethernet and an SD card slot. You may want to get a USB dock that has these and additional USB ports.<br/><br/>Now the graphics card. First off, this is NOT a gaming laptop nor does it claim to be. This is a low power version of the RTX 3050 Ti. If you buy this with gaming as your primary focus, you'll be disappointed. There are dedicated gaming laptops that will do a much better job.<br/><br/>With that being said, this laptop is one that is capable of doing some lighter gaming and doing it reasonably well. It will perform better than other thin and light graphics solutions like the Nvidia MX450 or the Intel Xe. Think more of playing a game in your hotel after a day of work. The lower power edition will have lower performance than other RTX 3050 Ti's running at a higher wattage. The graphics card is there to give a boost to creator software like Photoshop and Premier. This laptop is primarily a work laptop. Still gaming will be significantly better than with the onboard Radeon graphics, or a comparable laptop with Intel Xe graphics.<br/><br/>Screen is pretty good for its segment.  Sound is ok. Headphones would be advised for better sound.<br/><br/>Keyboard backlight was another issue for me. The white backlight with the gold keys can make it hard to read with the backlight on. I found the keyboard more readable with the backlight off in a lit room. The middle right section of the keyboard was significantly dimmer than the left side and right edge. It made the keyboard even more difficult to read and quite frankly, it drove me nuts. My son's laptop didn't have the issue.<br/><br/>Acer offered to do a warranty repair for me, but a tech at an authorized Acer repair shop told me to just send it back as I'd have the situation resolved much more quickly. I ended up exchanging it for a laptop that better meets my needs (IA testing and development). I bought another Acer as I still like the brand. I just needed something a bit beefier and a bit more upgradeable. It's a great laptop for my son who has much more "normal" computing needs than I do.<br/><br/>Overall, it seems like a solid laptop for the price. It's not fancy but should do it's primary tasks well (business) with a little extra for entertainment. Compared to other thin and lights I've owned (an Aspire 5 and a Lenovo Ideapad 720S), this outperforms them.<br/><br/>If you go in with reasonable expectations, you should be quite happy with the purchase.</span>

<span>Acer Swift X SFX14-42G-R607 Creator Laptop |<br/><br/>14" Full HD 100% sRGB: The biggest downside if you are a gamer. The 60hz display. While it looks beautiful, brightens really well, and looks stunning.... games will be sluggish. I guess if you are a content creator or using the laptop for productivity, the screen would be great.<br/><br/>AMD Ryzen 7 5825U - Not a bad processor at all. Again, pretty powerful if you are just creating content or using for standard productivity.<br/><br/>NVIDIA RTX 3050 Ti Laptop GPU: impressive graphic card for a 14-in laptop that is not considered a gaming laptop. For a hardcore gamer, this graphics card would not be enough. For a mid-range gamer (overwatch, for example), it would suffice. But again, the drawback here is the 60 hz screen.<br/><br/>16GB LPDDR4X: The ram is soldered on, so you won't be able to improve on this. 16 GB, although becoming outdated, is not too bad.<br/><br/>512GB SSD:Plenty of space being that most of what we do is on the cloud, and especially cuz you won't be playing any AAA titles that need a large amount of space.<br/><br/>Wi-Fi 6: well not bad, you could always upgrade it to the Wi-Fi 6e card by opening it up.<br/><br/>Overall, it really depends what you're going to get this laptop for.<br/><br/>If you are getting it to edit videos, create content, word processing, use for school, use for medium to light work, used for middle of the road gaming... the portability is fantastic. Super light, super thin, and nice gray finish.<br/><br/>If you are getting this laptop to be able to play AAA titles on the go, it won't happen. You're better off with a Razer Blade 14 or a Rog. Substantial price difference.<br/><br/>I personally have a desktop gaming PC and I thought it would be a Good laptop to play overwatch and some lighter games while traveling, but the 60 hz screen ruined it for me.</span>

<span>I was looking for a replacement computer gift with decent modern specs and this one had hit all of the right buttons. Good brand, good parts, great price, no catches.<br/><br/>Naturally everything is going to be a lower powered variant. It is an ultrabook after all. But as an upgrade from a 6 year old gaming laptop it certainly decimates that in performance. When I look at comparative modern laptops with 3050's in them they seem to be more expensive with less features (8GB RAM, smaller drives, overheating issues). They just don't make as much sense. Plus, LPDDR4 turns out to be actually more of an advantage if you really want optimized power draw overall.<br/><br/>For regular use this ultrabook balances that power draw with meeting your performance demands. It starts up in seconds (especially on an upgraded 2TB SSD). Another reviewer of the same model said it has 2 slots but I only saw one when opening it and in the documentation. I very much hope I jam completely wrong and just missed it so I can add more storage, but you should only expect 1 slot to use.<br/><br/>For gaming, it can basically run everything to date. Not necessarily on ultra unless it's older titles but surprisingly reasonably given the 3050 ti and high core AMD CPU. The fans are louder doing Windows updates than with playing. Just make sure you have your applications (including productivity like graphics software) set in your NVIDIA control panel to use the NVIDIA processor option. You may have to manually set some things that way to avoid using the APU.<br/><br/>The only real downside to it is the lack of ports. You'll end up using a hub if you need more peripherals, unless you have a fancy unified dongle. But if you're using those higher end products then you're probably not buying this computer to be fair.<br/><br/>Honestly, I don't know why Acer is selling this for so cheap (It's varied for the past few months from $750-$800 full retail) but I'm grateful that they are. Easy 5/5 value.</span>

<span>First of all, this is a big upgrade for me. My previous laptop was a Toshiba C55 with Intel i3 4th Gen proccesor, 8gb DDR3 ram and a 256 SSD. I was ok with that laptop but I felt that I needed an upgrade. Man I made the right decision!<br/><br/>This laptop has everything I've wanted in a computer, except the graphics card of course. All in all, I'm really happy with the purchase.<br/><br/>Pros:<br/>1. This laptop is thin and light. I can definitely take this laptop anywhere without noticing that I really have it with me.<br/>2. I've seen some comments that the sound is bad. Well guess what, It's not bad at all. Not the quality of a Mackbook pro, but come on, for the price? It actually sounds pretty good. Those two speakers in the bottom, when hitting against the table, it bounces off giving a really good base sound, allthough they have the potential to get a bit louder, but that aside, it's great for a laptop this thin.<br/>3. Others say that the screen is horrible. I don't see anything horrible about it. It's not full IPS quality, but the 1080p screen looks pretty good. Again, taking you back to the price, can't beat it.<br/>4. The backlit keyboard is beautiful! Even though the keyboard needs a bit more work (make it feel more clicky), the white backlit makes this laptop look like a pro when putting it side by side with other well known brands out there.<br/>5. There's enough peripherals for what I need. Comes with 2 USB's on the left side, 1 USB-A on the right side, HDMI, USB-C and the sd card slot. Not bad for the size of this laptop. Enough for a thin laptop. Unfortunately it didn't come with an ethernet port, which I use a lot for a more stable connection, but that's what external usb network arapters are for.<br/>6. Extra slot for another 2.5 HDD/SSD. Not many laptops at this price range have that, so I'm really glad this one does in case I want to expand my storage a bit more.<br/>7. The battery life is just great. The first time I fully charged it, I used it for about 5 hours and it still had some juice left. I think I could have used it up to 6 hours for me to charge it back again. I used it with minimum backlit brightness and about half screen brightness. Not bad at all. Oh, and the charging time, amazing, from 10% to 100% in about an hour, could have been less<br/><br/>Cons:<br/>1. The flex cable adapter for the additional internal HDD/SDD is not included in the box. I believe this should be included all the time for all of the laptops that offer the chance to expand the storage. Not much of a biggie though, you can find that adapter in amazon for about 12 bucks.<br/>2. Cannot upgrade the ram further than 16gb + the integrated 4gb that's soldered into the motherboard. This is unfortunate since it would have been a great oportunity to add some options to update the RAM to 32gb.<br/><br/>As you can see, there are way more pros than cons, so you can definitely tell that I really like this laptop. Give it a try, I totally recommend it.</span>

<span>UPDATE 3, October/22 FINALLY!<br/><br/>Well, it seems like I can finally say that the issue was taken care of (crossing fingers so I don't jinx myself).<br/>After sending it back, again, which by the way I didn't have to pay for shipping in any direction this time as I was under warranty when I sent it back the first time (I had extended the warranty by registering the product online, it's something they offered after purchase). I wrote some notes and added them to the return package. I seems like they listened! I had mentioned that one of their tech support agents had hinted that the issue was the graphics card. On their return notes they stated that the graphics card (I believe this would mean the whole motherboard) had been replaced. So far, I have not been able to replicate the main issue I was having, which was freezing streaky screens, which used to gravely affect my editing work. I must mention that I have not pushed the machine too much, just enough. The problem was that the freezing-streaking issue used to happen even without pushing the graphics card too hard. So, I'm happier with how it is working now, nearly two years after I purchased it.<br/>There are some caveats, however. 1. When I change the "User Scenario" from Extreme Performance to either Balanced or Super Battery the machine has either crashed or become unstable. I pretty much keep it on Extreme mode most of the time as I do a lot of heavy tasks. I had switched to balanced because I was using it it where I couldn't plug it and I needed the battery to last longer. 2. Although I haven't experienced the Freeze and streaks issue the laptop kind of resets my displays and seems to reset the Windows Explorer environment (but I take that over freezing and loosing my work) once in a while. I had seen this issue about 3 times now since getting it back but, surprisingly, no major crashes, other than the ones stated on point number 1 above.<br/>I'm glad that MSI kept their word and honored the warranty. I mentioned before that I had extended the warranty but, by the time I had to send it back the second time, even the extended had expired. It was understood, however, that the first fix they tried (which was practically zero) didn't work, and I was still under warranty, so they had to make it right even when my original warranty had expired.<br/>I do recommend if you're going to send yours back for repair, that you send it back with all the original components (RAM and perhaps even the Hard Drive, but mainly RAM). That way they will not "misdiagnose" your machine and send it back to you with no real work done (see previous updates for more context).<br/>I upped my rating from 1 star to 3 since it was a real pain in the *** to get it all straighten. (keeping fingers cross for the next 5 years ;-) )<br/><br/>UPDATE 2 May/22<br/>Support has not improved. Admittedly, they say that "translating" the messages causes some delays and misunderstandings.<br/>Anyways here's the scoop:<br/>I sent the device back as is still under warranty. I had to pay for shipping however. They "tested" it and coincidentally, the only thing that "failed" was the RAM. Mind you I'm a technician myself and I've tested the RAM and it's in perfect working condition. The kicker is, of course, is that I upgraded the RAM, so it's not the original one. But, I upgraded the RAM thinking that would help with the issues I was having. NOPE. The laptop fails with the original RAM on board and with the upgraded RAM, which happens to be SAMSUNG. So, I got good quality perfectly working RAM for my new laptop (not so new anymore) but it didn't help with the freezing/crashing issue. I'm requesting for them to retest the device with the original RAM (since they say my upgrade is a "failed one").<br/>Needless to say, It has been an extremely slow and frustrating process, between how busy I am, the slow replies, the 'misunderstandings', having to explain to them the same thing over and over. This is probably the first and last MSI machine I'll ever buy.<br/><br/>Update 4/6. Support keeps ignoring my messages, at least directly on their site. I will have to try their live chat service to see if that makes any difference. When something like this happens you cannot recommend their product. Even sometimes when the product is not "high end" but they have good support it makes them look better and you appreciate their business more. So far MSI is letting me down big time. Shame.<br/><br/>I must start by saying that this is a powerful machine and when it works it's great. UNFORTUNATELY! I've been experiencing constant crashes/freezes when doing video editing. Needless to say that, crashes you experience when you are "creating" is the worst that could happen. You gotta have reliability in what you use as your main tool for video editing, you spend good money on it and expect it to do its job. This hasn't been the case for this laptop. From my very first project I experienced the first crashes and I thought an update had taken care of that initial problem, but, alas! I started another project recently and crash after crash was the story for a while. Oddly, the machine could go almost full 24hrs with no crashes, and the next day crash on me 3 or 4 times almost in a row. I had attached 2 external monitors to it and that seemed to upset things more, I had to unplug one of them to mitigate the issue. I'm concerned about whether I got a "lemon"? Other reviewers here seem to have good experiences and little to none issues. The other point I want to make is that, yes, a full year warranty is offered but I recently contacted their Support team about this problem, and I got a dry short answer, "do this, then do that" No explanation as to what could be wrong, no warning as to what the suggested 'fix' risks are, etc. Not impressed so far, but I'll update this review and rating when and if the issues are taken care of.</span>

<span>I was installing Discord, steam, some other non-game related applications TWO at a time and it was overheating the left side of my laptop HARD. I haven't even tried a game or several chrome tabs yet. This was all AFTER I updated Windows and Nvidia.<br/><br/>Now we get to the gaming. Testing it with Baldur's Gate 3 and it automatically set it to ULTRA settings, minus DLSS, etc. The game is BEAUTIFUL (kinda running better than my gaming Desktop actually lol). But... just sitting at the main menu is 66 Celsius. (150F). CPU and GPU are pretty equivalent but CPU goes between 50-75C. You'd think that's fine, right? Well I had to use the loud as heck fan (Performance Mode) or it would hit 80C. Sitting at a somewhat avg of 71F in the tutorial area in the game and my keyboard is super warm to the touch. Especially the center. I am also kind of concerned for airflow since the bottom of the case is just... well let's just say bugs can get inside, or toothpicks, etc. No airflow... There is no proper covering for this. The 78C pic is when normal fan is going. 72 when Performance fan is going. This isn't even the big open world area in this game yet. If they fix the heating issue, honestly it's a 5 out of 5 stars. I think i'm going to need a cooling pad... As I am typing this, the center keys are really, really warm now. I do not think it is 71C in the center area of the motherboard.</span>

<span>Oh man, this MSI Nvidia 3070 Gaming Laptop is exhilarating. I have the capability to run Ultra graphics/ RTX graphics and 144hz. The storage is a bit small for my liking, I plan to soon upgrade my storage and RAM capacity. The CPU, Core i7 11th Gen, is a beast. I purchased the “Used “Like New,” so I obtained this at an affordable price ($1.2k). 2weeks in, I am experiencing no issues. Win 10 can easily be changed to Win 11 for free. The MSI Center application is very resourceful, that’s where you can change the keyboard color and configure/monitor other goodie’s.<br/><br/>Overall, if you’re looking for a gaming laptop that’s very powerful and has a decent price tag, I 100% recommended this rig.</span>

<span>Using it for 3 months now, it is a solid laptop and punches way above its weight class for price to performance. The 3070 (graphics card) is undervolted. But what do you expect in a laptop? It still plays 1080p games really well and the display looks crisp. Not as great as a dedicated $400 monitor, but as far as laptops go, this is really good.<br/><br/>I haven't played a single game it doesn't do 1080 at high/max settings with at least 60 fps. Usually more.<br/><br/>Camera is good, internet is as fast as an ethernet cable. No complaints. Mine didn't ship with windows 11 which meant it needed a full day of installation to get it where I wanted it.<br/><br/>Battery is meh. But it's a gaming machine that draws a lot of power.</span>
