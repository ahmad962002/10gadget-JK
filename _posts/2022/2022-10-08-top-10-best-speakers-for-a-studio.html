description: This article provides a comprehensive review of the top 10 best speakers for a studio available on Amazon, including input from buyers to assist you in making the best purchase.
---



Best studio speakers are those that provide an accurate and flat frequency response. This is important for ensuring that the mixdown of a song or audio project sounds true-to-life. Additionally, studio monitors should provide a wide soundstage so that the mix engineer has a good sense of how the project will ultimately sound when played back on a different system. Budget-minded listeners may want to consider purchasing second-hand studio monitors, as they will often provide better sound quality than consumer-grade speakers. Some of the best studio monitors on the market today include the Yamaha HS8, the KRK RP6 G3, and the Genelec 1031A.<table>

<span>This is my 2nd PreSonus system.  My first was a much bigger speaker system for my studio/band room and works great for both band practice and just vocal singing to backing tracks learning new songs to play out. I have not mixed yet on them but that will come soon. Now on the newest members to my speaker familey my desktop E3.5. Just needed some speakers for my computer room that I have hooked up to my Fractal Axe-FXll Xl guitar modeling preamp. So I can stream music off YouTube and practice new songs for my band or just work on new original songs for my other project.<br/> The PreSonus Eris E3.5 ROCKS my world in a big way. The speakers have great bass response for just small speakers, I can even practice bass guitar playing or just check out new music on YouTube. They are a very good balanced mix on all music and great dynamics too!  I have to say have to watch the output level cause they do get very loud, but keep the music clear and focused with no distortion at all. I just can't believe PreSonus small footprint of desktop computer speakers system can sound this good. Well they hold up, that's still to be seen but so far all my PreSonus speakers are doing great, it's a great company. My drummer own there recording software and loves it.  I will have to say PreSonus, you hit another one out of the ball park with this package. Great Job guys!!  Oh, by the way shipping was killer too, very fast and nice people as always. Thanks Amazon! :)</span>

<span>I decided to pull the trigger on purchasing these Presonus Eris E3.5-3.5" Near Field Studio Monitors based not only on reviews here on Amazon, but other music sites that sell them, because I wanted to span the universe of opinions as to what to expect with the sound quality vs. value.<br/>First, let me preface my review by stating two facts. #1: I've worked in radio and audio engineering for a long time, and my ears have been subject to a wide variety of pro &amp; semi pro and even amature gear. I can discern decent audio quality when I hear it.  #2: If you don't know the difference between a studio monitor and a pair of speakers, stop reading now &amp; move on to another review, because you just won't get it.<br/><br/>These monitors arrived well packed, in new condition, with all accessories inside the box, very simple. There's the power cord, a set of RCA cables, as well as a 1/8th" aux input cable, along with an instruction manual &amp; some rubberized pads to place on the bottom of the speakers if you desire to use them (as for me, I bought a pair of isolation foam pads as I found a great value on a decent pair, and I know good iso pads will make a difference *Trust me, they DO!*  Finally, there's a a interconnecting cable (it's six feet in length) that connects the master speaker (which is the left speaker) to the sattellite speaker (the right)<br/>Setup was EZ-PZ!<br/>Plugged in the aux connection cable to the speaker, and plugged the other end into my cell phone I loaded up with some test audio files I recorded on my DAW at 326Kbps.<br/>First impression when I began listening to the first track (Boston's More Than A Feeling) was the fade up intro sounded nice &amp; clean, and I was hearing very nice sounding instrumentation coming from the source audio.  I then proceeded to connect the RCA inputs to my new Audio-Technica AT-LP120XUSB Direct-Drive Turntable, which features a  AT-VM95E stylus.  I selected Mobile Fidelity Sound Lab's Electric Light Orchestra - Time.<br/>I selected this test disc due to my respect for Jeff Lynn as a recording engineer &amp; musician. He uses a wide range of analog &amp; synth instruments which i feel will help me judge the quality of these monitors, and they were sounds which I felt would fairly help me assess the frequency response these monitors are capable of delivering.<br/><br/>After listening to that album, &amp; then tossing another few disc's on the platter to compare what I was hearing (favorites always include Walter Eagen's - Magnet &amp; Steel &amp; Pink Floyd's - The Wall, I was convinced I was enjoying a true "Stereo Monitor" experience.  No need for me to color the neutral sound emanating from the speakers by adjusting the tonal controls on the back of the main speaker.  I was receiving a very nice signal from both the mp3 files I played through my phone using the aux-input jack (which is something I would be planning to do on occasion) and the sound quality output by the a AT-LP120XUSB Direct-Drive Turntable was very pleasing.<br/><br/>The room I am using these monitors in is a about 18' x 12', and there is no need for me to crank the volume up much past just below the halfway point to enjoy a pleasurable listening experience while I sit back on my couch and enjoy listening to music from a distance of about six feet away from where the monitors are place.<br/><br/>For the average audio fan looking for a decent, reliable, entry level pair of studio monitors to faithfully replicate audio (be it from a turntable, tape deck, or mp3 player) without any audio artifacts &amp; coloration, I would definitely recommend these  Eris E3.5-3.5" Near Field Studio Monitors  by Presonus.<br/><br/>Assuming these speakers wear well, and don't suddenly klunk out on me, I'm feeling very happy with my purchase &amp; look forward to utilizing them along with my new turntable I treated myself to, because (frankly) my ears were getting fatigued listening to some really crappy mp3 recordings,  and they say all things come full circle, while I prided myself converting my old analog production studio into a digital audio environment, even recording critical audio as a stereo .Wav file, and mp3's at the highest possible bitrate a given player would play back, nothing really matched the sonic excellence I can hear when playing back music on vinyl.  I wasn't going to go broke however returning to my musical playback roots, so I carefully researched and chose the components I budgeted for, &amp; am glad I chose these speakers to provide that last interface in the sonic delivery to my ears, in my opinion - these were a wise choice to make.</span>

<span>This would be an amazing set of powered speakers if only there was not constant, audible white noise. The problem gets worse when a bluetooth device is paired, it goes from just white noise to another, crunchier sound that can easily be heard from several feet away.<br/><br/>I have the speakers wired to a UPS outputting a true sinusoidal waveform. I have also plugged it into a power conditioner with the same results. The level of the noise is not affected by the volume knob.<br/><br/>It's a shame because the sound is otherwise great. Unfortunately the constant noise is a bit annoying. I ended up moving the speakers a little further from me (~3' from my face) and raised them so the tweeter is above my head and it's not so noticeable.</span>

Los uso para edición de audio y video en Final Cut, Premiere, Aaudition y After effects. Funcionan perfecto. Y para escuchar música cuando diseño son ideales, una calidad realmente excelente de Bass and Brebble para quienes disfrutamos del audio en alta fidelidad.

<span>These are better than anything from Logitech and especially all the no-name Chinese junk speakers at this price but that's not saying much. They will play rather loud for their size without completely distorting or falling apart which could be a plus for some.<br/><br/>First off you power these up and there's an audible kind of digital hiss regardless of what you have connected or not connected. The Class-D digital audio amplifier is obviously low quality if you can plainly hear the digital hash. You have to be close to the speakers to hear it but these are, after all, desktop speakers so you're often going to be close. I can plainly hear the hiss sitting in my office chair. That's a hard FAIL Mackie that your competition doesn't suffer from.<br/><br/>Next up better desktop monitors are bi-amped with separate amplifiers for the woofer and tweeter and an electronic crossover. Not these. They use a simple passive crossover for the tweeter and just a basic 2 channel low quality class-D amplifier. They're also not very phase accurate in the process resulting in weird spatial imaging.<br/><br/>Unlike in the PreSonus E3.5, the tweeter dome is also unprotected and could easily be damaged by curious fingers especially from a child. Mackie seems to be assuming these will be used in a pristine adult studio environment?<br/><br/>Comparing these to the slightly more expensive and near identically sized PreSonus E3.5 monitors the Mackie speakers will play louder without falling apart but they're otherwise similar. Some might argue the PreSonus are arguably more accurate if you don't push them hard. The PreSonus also have a front panel input jack which the Mackie speakers lack.<br/><br/>Comparing both to the similarly sized JBL 104-BT there's NO comparison. The JBL's reach much lower with real instead of fake tubby bass, have a more balanced sound, and are much less fatiguing to listen to. They're also much heavier with higher build quality and offer more features including Bluetooth and mixing more simultaneous input sources. They won't, however, play as loud.<br/><br/>JBL (a Harmon company) has massive R&amp;D resources that shame Mackie and PreSonus so it's no surprise they can make much better desktop monitors but they are, admittedly, more expensive. Still, as a consumer what matters most with speakers is how they sound. And, of the 3, the Mackie CR3-Xs play the loudest but it's a harsh boom box sort of loud. The slightly more expensive PreSonus are more polite and don't hiss like the Mackie but they fall apart at higher volumes and are even more fatiguing to listen to than the Mackie speakers. Ultimately if you value sound quality and features the JBL 104-BTs completely crush both the Mackie and PreSonus speakers despite being very similar in size.<br/><br/>There are also lots of posts regarding the Mackie CR3-X's failing just outside of their minimal1 year warranty. So that's something else to keep in mind. I usually don't recommend extended warranties but with these failure prone speakers it might prove to be a good option as Mackie seems to have made them as cheaply as possible in China hoping most at least don't fail in the first year or customers toss them in the trash when they fail. Once upon a time Mackie was a really high quality manufacture but not anymore as these speakers clearly demonstrate.</span>

<span>UPDATE:  After playing with the positioning and getting proper stands , these sound better than i thought.  Still missing some mid and they're definitely not full range, but the bass parts are much more true to actual than I thought.  A good starter set for sure!<br/><br/>I bought the CR-X 3s to use as DJ monitor speakers for my twitch streaming and gaming, and they're great so far.  So much nicer than mixing listening in headphones or off computer speakers.<br/><br/>These definitely do not provide 'true sound' howeveer: The bass is pumped up and the mid range is lacking.  I'd say for $100, they're a great deal for a little pair of powered(!) speakers for gaming, streaming, or just listening to music.  I wouldn't try to produce music tracks with these.  You'll need speakers that cover a much more dynamic range and are 'flat' (IE true sounding with no taint).</span>

<span>These are a perfect pair of budget speakers. When i first purchased these speakers, i was worried about the “hissing” sound that people were talking about. Upon receiving them and hooking them up, yes, they do in fact have a “hiss”. Now with me not being a vindictive person, I used them as they were for a few weeks and the sound would almost become nonexistent until i stopped doing what i was doing and sat still looking at my phone or something. I then decided that i could probably fix it some myself, having dealt with an abundance of faulty cheap speakers throughout my life.  After using some handy dandy TRS cables and some thicker gauged power wire, i was able to reduce the sound to a minimum. Yes it’s still present, but no where as bad as some of the reviews led me to believe it would be out of the box.<br/><br/>I think before you consider these you should genuinely ask yourself, “should i spend the extra $100 on a better studio quality speaker?” And the answer to that is yes. If you’re looking for studio quality sound, don’t cheap out. If you’re like me and know how to troubleshoot things to making them better, pull the trigger on these if you’re trying to save money.<br/><br/>In closing, they are in fact an excellent set of speakers. Having been in many concert band performances and marching band shows, my hearing is not the most sensitive to sounds like that. So yes, i do recommend these speakers as a budget option and if you’re not gonna scream and cry over a little speaker noise.<br/><br/>Hope this helps with your decision!</span>

<span>If you're looking for a set of speakers for your computer, this is the set to buy. For $100 you will not find a better performing set of speakers.<br/><br/>I was tired of having a 2.1 setup with a boxy subwoofer on the floor, and multiple cables for R/L speaker, connection to the computer, and power. I was using Creative Z623 (discontinued but the current model Z625 can be had at Logitech for $170) which are 200W THX certified speakers. They sounded good, the bass was great. The main issue I had was I wanted to regain floor space. With a midtower desktop case and the subwoofer, I was losing around 4sqft next to my desk.  Enter Edifier R1280T (Note I have no need to use these with Bluetooth devices, they will be dedicated to my PC).<br/><br/>Easy setup -<br/>1. Speaker wire (included) connects left speaker to the right (which has the amp and controls)<br/>2. RCA to 3.5mm cable (included) connects right speaker to your PC. Note here that the included cable is 6ft, which may or may not be long enough if your PC is on the left of your desk (like mine) and you want to spread out the speakers a bit. I ordered a longer (and better quality) cable on amazon for $10.<br/>3. Plug in power cord from right speaker<br/><br/>Almost mandatory adjustments for maximum performance:<br/>1. These speakers have volume control. Windows has volume control. That means there's a bit of trial and error determining how high you want to set the speaker volume vs master volume in Windows. I set Windows volume to 50%, then I set the speaker volume to it's maximum. Then I can use windows to make it even louder, and no it didn't clip the sound or distort. Now a comfortable sound level for me is around 30%. It's freaking loud at 70%. Loud enough that I think I may be annoying my neighbors. However at 2% I can still hear it (albeit faint). So Your mileage may vary, but you can play with these two volume controls to get the sweet spot for how you like to listen with plenty of headroom.<br/><br/>2. EQ - a MUST.<br/>Out of the box I have to admit I was a bit disappointed. With the speaker bass/treble knobs set at 0, and windows playing a flat EQ, the speakers were fairly disappointing. Especially considering I was coming from a 2.1 system with a subwoofer that banged. There was just no real low end punch with the Edifiers under this setup. In addition, I initially tested these without doing the volume setup mentioned above and the speakers were fairly low (in terms of Dbs) even at max volume in Windows.<br/><br/>I have an MSI motherboard which uses Realtek HD Audio Manager drivers. This is located in Control Panel. When I open this app it lets me change the speaker configuration, default format, as well as "sound effects." By the way, these settings are also found in Windows Sound Control Panel, but I liked the RealTek interface better, plus, there is no way to adjust the EQ manually in Windows' panel.<br/><br/>From the Sound Effects I was able to create an EQ that sounded pretty good. Then I used the control knobs on the right speaker to punch up the bass and dial back the treble a little.<br/><br/>After making these changes I was totally blown away. What a difference this makes in the performance of the speakers. If you're not getting a great sound from your set, adjust your EQ. I now have a reasonably good replacement to my 2.1 system. Does the bass hit like a sub? no it doesn't. But these are small bookshelf speakers. It sounds great, and gets so loud that I want to immediately turn them down.<br/><br/>Coming back to the price for a second, you may find fault in the performance, but compared to what? I challenge you to find any speakers for $100 that can do what these do. Go ahead, I'll wait.<br/><br/>Just buy them, you won't regret it. They are still small enough to not take over your desk, but are big enough that you'll actually want to listen to them (unlike smaller "computer speakers").</span>

<span>I have enjoyed good music in my 70 years on earth.  I started like many others, when I was a young teenager with the Stones, Beatles and The Who.  My mind was treated to new audio sensations when I started listening to Pink Floyd and the Moody Blues and the like.  I have NEVER stopped enjoying music.  I appreciate many styles of music from Classical, New Age, Piano Solos to Classic Rock,  Hard Rock and screaming guitar solos and heart trobbing drum beats (AC/DC)  You can't begin to enjoy the nuances of these songs without the proper equipment.<br/><br/>Over the years I have gone thru the 33 1/3 era, buying many different turntables &amp; cartridges, looking for the perfect comgination for that just right sound. Then came Audio Cassettes, then Mini-Discs, then CDs, now MP3s, each getting better &amp; better.  Of coarse my bank account got smaller and smaller as I insisted on having the best quality I could afford. I always updated my entire sound system so it kept up with the new technology.  Not the most expensive but good enough.  I ran a small Mobile DJ business for 15 years back in the 80's  I carried about 500 lbs of the biggest and baddest sound system I could get.  My client reviews always came out with high marks cause the sound system kicked ass.<br/><br/>What does all this babble have to do with these speakers that I have never heard of in my life? Well.... THEY KICK ASS!!!<br/><br/>I was setting up an exersise gym in my livingroom (Wierd?) and wanted some self powered bookshelf speakers to listen to a few tunes while I used the new Nautilus Treadmill.  I came across the Edifiers R1280T's and started reading the reviews and was slightly dissapointed with some of the negative reviews.  BUT.... there were plenty of satisfied customers to convince me to order them.<br/><br/>I set them up on a piece of furniture with my 32" Visio TV &amp; trusty Tivo. I plugged in a few wires &amp; cables turned on the TV, pulled up the concert on the Tivo of John Fogerty: The Long Road Home and it starts off with "Playing in a Traveling Band"  I cranked those speakers up so loud I thought they were going to melt.  The bass notes were clean and solid.  the specs on these speakers say 75 to 18k frequency response but It sounds like a much bigger range than that.  The vocals are clear,  the guitar breaks will give you chills. The audience cheering makes you think you are there.  It almost makes me want to smoke some of that wacky stuff. When finished I logged on to Pandora music streaming to the "New Age Piano Solo" channel and lowered the volume down to a whisper.  Beautiful, Beautiful clean full music!!<br/><br/>These Edifiers are the best bookshelf size speakers I have ever owned!!  I am really impressed.  I wish everyone could come over to my house and I'll put on a thrilling rock party for you. (even at 70 I still get the itch for a party)  Next test,  I'm gonna plug in my Samsung Galaxy S7e and crank it up on a song by Golden Earring: "Radar Love" and let it work it's way thru the other 1000+ songs.  It works great on Smart Phones Tablets &amp; Laptops.<br/><br/>I am very pleased with these speakers.  I wish you could hear what I hear.  You can!!  GO BUY YOUR OWN. PLAY IT LOUD and ENJOY!<br/>Hope this helped.</span>

KRK showed that really know how to help the customer feel confident with their product.  At first, I was upset about a "hiss" in the speaker, but I purchased a Furman power conditioner ($90) that reduced the noise by a good ~90%.<br/><br/>Seriously fantastic speakers, I'm hearing things that I've never heard before in my favorite tracks.  I love JBL and their monitors may be slightly more affordable but I trust KRK to come through if there's ever any issues.<br/><br/>Pro-tip, save yourself some money by purchasing the bigger speakers so you don't need a subwoofer.

<span>Ported has a bit of a boom. You have to watch and control for that. These are fine. You need 8" to get any base. Or get smaller and have a sub. Even in a small room these are fine.<br/><br/>Not they are not well shielded. I get a buzz from computer wires even when the speaker is off. I do not get that noise on my cheaper JBL LSR305s.</span>

<span>These are great monitors for audio engineers, or for audiophiles looking for a more faithful listening experience. Music is already mixed and remastered before being published, so by using popular sound bars you are essentially putting a filter on a filter, and if you care about these things you are butchering a complete piece. These will work great for accuracy and sound editing. I had to buy an adapter to convert the signal in order to connect these to my TV</span>

<span>I remember the smile that hit my face the first time I sat down between this pair of monitors. The sound is so creamy and clear. Bass is nicely balanced so it's not overpowering but does have an optional bass boost in the back if you need a bit more. They're classy and professional looking. The housings are solidly built and don't feel cheap or flimsy. I only have one gripe and it's more personal than anything. I don't like that if I'm starting a YouTube video or song or any media, there is second or two where the signal coming out of the monitors is severely stifled before it kicks in at set volume. I'm sure this is a safety feature to keep from blowing your ears out or frying your reference monitors but all the same, it irks me.</span>

<span>I got these for my Nephew's DAW system I bought him.  I tried these out as studio Monitors and as home entertainment speakers.  For studio monitors, they are not neutral and they sound very nice which is a problem, as you want flat/ neutral speakers for your mix, so you can adjust for a common broadcast standards.  However,  I liked the sound, as I did not have to EQ them it for my bad old ears.</span>

<span>I like them so much I named them. Their names are Alyssa and Alexis because those names sounded familiar. It's good there were two speakers because I was really indecisive with the names. They sound strong. The frequency does get down to 60 and it's not bad, however I did buy a subwoofer and it helps. I have not decided on a name for the subwoofer.</span>

<span>I bought my first pair of the Elevate 5 (Mk I) about six years ago, purely for personal use at home.<br/><br/>I wasn't expecting a lot for the price, but they impressed me greatly.<br/><br/>So I started buying them at work for use in our edit booths, as we have rebuilt the whole post side of the studio building over the past couple of years. I haven't gotten a single complaint about them. I'm an electrical engineer, not a mixing artist. I can best describe the sound as almost completely neutral. They have none of the artificial low-end boominess which seems common in low-cost powered monitors, they just deliver a solid, linear sound across the whole spectrum. With near-zero perceptible distortion even when I drive them up to "this is bordering on uncomfortable" levels.<br/><br/>Fast forward a couple of years. I just bought a new house, and it has a huge kitchen. I decided that I wanted a good speaker system in there, as I tend to rock out on Pandora when cooking, and wanted to upgrade from my old kitchen / yardwork headphones, as they deprive me of situational awareness such as the sounds coming from the stove.<br/><br/>I demoed a few sets of bluetooth-native powered monitors at a local music shop, and just wasn't impressed by any of them.<br/><br/>So I decided that I'm just gonna live with using an external bluetooth-to-RCA adapter which I already had lying around, and ordered my ninth set of these (and second for personal use) yesterday.<br/><br/>Figured that with that kind of purchase history, I owed them a review.<br/><br/>They're just phenomenally great speakers for the price. Are they Genelec 8030s? No, they are not. But they're 90% of the quality for 20% of the cost.</span>

<span>I've owned a pair of Cannon TLS-822s, three pair of Polks, a pair of Klipsch, and a Klipsch 2.1 promedia's as well as other speakers in my lifetime. I've got to say these speakers sound awesome. I think as far as depth of sound and imaging I like them better than the promedia's. I live in an apartment and the sub-woofer was a little much at times leading me to turn it down. I'm hearing things out of these speakers I haven't heard for years. I'm now looking for good recordings of my favorite music. These speakers are plenty loud and have plenty of base. I would say that if one needs to have wall shattering base at the expense of clarity and imaging than find a set with a sub or add a sub to these if you can. I watched a video on you tube where someone had the woofers bouncing around like crazy. I was a little concerned with all that movement. I have had these loud enough to get in trouble and they weren't giggling around like jello. They weren't moving hardly at all. The cabinet is a wood material. These are stout speakers. Bravo Pioneer!</span>

<span>They're decent little monitors. But they are just adequate really. Not really much for bass. Responsive though... I mix vinyl and the timing is crucial. These definitely give me a better picture for queueing than running the mixer through my receiver.</span>
