<p> </p><ul>
<li><span class="a-list-item"> DIGITAL CONTROL &amp; DISPLAY: The new version of Vevor heat press is equipped with a precision digital display controller with built-in dual-screen display, easy to operate &amp; control. Unique silicone keys feel comfortable and easy to press! Press (+/-) to switch ℃ and °F at will.  </span></li>
<li><span class="a-list-item"> DUAL-TUBE HEATING: Unlike ordinary single tube heating, our heat press 15x15 adopts the latest double-tube heating technology. That makes the temperature difference is only about 5 ℃ between the center and the edge. But the old-fashioned heating tube is more than 10 ℃. Heating more evenly.  </span></li>
<li><span class="a-list-item"> 360° SWING AWAY Swing: Swing arm of this heat press is fully rotated 360°, allowing the heating element to move aside and reducing accidental contact. Full-range pressure-adjustment knob allows better controlled pressure, making the pressure to be applied directly &amp; evenly downwards enhances the quality of transfer further.  </span></li>
<li><span class="a-list-item"> HIGH-SECURITY PERFORMANCE: Thanks to the new heat press use of two layers of insulation technology, the surface temperature is only about 50-70℃, when the working temperature reaches 210 ℃，which is safer and more reliable to avoid being scalded! But the traditional shirt press machine's temperature can reach 70-100℃.  </span></li>
<li><span class="a-list-item"> 8 IN 1 VERSATILE KIT: VEVOR new heat press with a 15x15" (38x38cm) large heat platen, the 8 in 1 heat press uses Teflon-coated platen, non-stick &amp; stable, and it effectively prevents scorching during thermal transfer. Suitable for applying letters, numbers, and patterns onto caps, T-shirts, mugs, plates, aluminum pots, etc.  </span></li>

<span>No directions involved or given, YouTube videos and the appropriate directions from the ink, paper, and product suppliers are your best bet to sublimate anything. Iron on stuff, this is easy machine is awesome hard to beat. All the attachments in my purchase seem to be about 1 to 2 inches short of the best to fit any of the variations of drink containers. coffee mugs being the best thing ever. I split the prints to do two sides instead of doing a wrap and the two I just did were awesome. as a machine it works great but you have to tell it what to do.</span>

<span>My machine stopped working after 2 days being in use. I'm not able to produce anything for my small business because my heat press will not work. E2 flashes and it no longer heats up. I purchased in Feb opened it up early April, after 3 weeks in use, it's no longer useful.<br/><br/>Although it had a dysfunctional issue, this company has sent a replacement heat press that is working excellent!! I'm now loving my machine and it's working just fine!! Give them a try..simply based on CUSTOMER SERVICE!!!!</span>

<span> Machine arrived in perfect condition. So far has exceeded my expectations. It's is easy to assemble. I had it up and running within 1 hour. This is my first fiber machine. I have the 50 watt and it hasn't disappointed me yet I use light burn on my other CO2 lasers I found the software easyto transition to. Quality is first rate. I am very pleased with it so so far. I haven't found anything I can mark from carbide to stainless steel with ease. No buyers regret it so far.</span>

<span>I have yet to use this product for silk screening. My only experience with this machine pertains to the quality of instructions for assembly, and for quality of components in the package.<br/><br/>I'm not sure where this product is manufactured, but right after opening the package and inspecting the components it is obvious that the factory where this product ships from has little to no quality control. In an effort to not draw this out to much I will bullet point the flaws below.<br/>- The Instruction manual was awful. They make IKEA instructions look like the holy bible.<br/>- Paint and Slag fills the threaded holes so much so that the screws try to cross thread constantly. I had to utilize a dremel tool to make them usable.<br/>- Some areas where holes should exist didn't have holes. I had to drill them out.<br/>- The tools sent were inadequate strength for proper assembly and some were the wrong size.<br/>- The pre-drilled holes in the center plate didn't line up with the half moon bearing pieces for the arms of the unit. I had to use a hammer and wrench to bend the pieces into shape in order for them to fit.<br/>- The washers for all of the bearing pieces were turned the wrong way, with the sharp edge facing the bearing. Something that would cause issues after repeated use. I had to disassemble the bearing assembly, and turn them around.<br/><br/>If you're still actually considering this product, let me summarize my feelings. If you're not a handy person with tools at your disposal, I wouldn't buy this product. If you are handy, and are looking for a unit that is sturdy and functional once it's built, then I believe this product is just fine.<br/><br/>Now that I have it assembled, it turns very smooth, and I don't see any reason why it won't work as advertised. One would be hard-pressed to find this much functionality for the price of $140.00, but it wasn't fun to put together.<br/><br/>I hope this helps.</span>

<span>Setting this up wasn’t hard because i took note of the other dudes steps from his review and, that helped me out a bit. Luckily i had no missing parts i just looked at images of it and put it together… This took me about 2 hours to do alone but i also took a break.. It’s whatever, but for me it was a 10/10 experience no complaints!! 🤷🏾‍♂️ W Buy!!</span>

<span>I’m so disappointed in this product. Like all the other reviews, I have to add that the instructions were pitiful. There was a dvd that went along with it but it was so badly shot that it made me sick watching it. And it wasn’t even helpful. They weren’t clear on the bolts and screws that you have to use for each part and the camera guys was so bad and shaky that you could barely tell which ones the guy chose.<br/><br/>That being said, I laid everything out and figured it all out. I was pretty pleased until I got to the clamps that are suppose to hold the screens in place.<br/><br/>Those were the hardest part for me. For one, I had to grab a wrench to help get it in, it was like the hole wasn’t cut all the way through. With each clamp, it had to get get far enough in before it got all the debris out and then it was so much easier to adjust them as needed. All of them but one arm. I had to force them as far down as possible to help clear the debris but it didn’t work on the last one and ended up getting stuck. And of course I couldn’t get it out. I ended up taking the arm apart to unscrew the blue piece and see if I could try from a different angle to get it unstuck. I couldnt.<br/><br/>I added the pictures so you can see the piece I was having a problem with. All the others worked just fine after some muscle but not the last one.<br/><br/>I’m giving it a three star because even though I fought like crazy with it, I can still use 3 out of the 4 arms. I’m hoping the sellers see this and are able to contact me. Hopefully you can send me another blue piece as well as two new clamps so I can use all 4 arms.</span>

<span> I had purchased this heat press on June 27, 2022. It didn't last 90 days. I called the warranty people &amp; they gave me the run-around &amp; stated that the seller had to replace it. It was a lot of back &amp; fourth. However I'm glad that I had insurance on it &amp; they provided me with a full refund. Do not buy unless you have insurance on it because the warranty people are not worth it.</span>

Counting function, three modes can be switched freely, the heat press machine has memory function, easily set &amp; store three sets of data, and there is no need to set parameters repeatedly.

<li><span class="a-list-item"> 360° Swing Away Design: The swing-away arm makes the pressure be applied directly and evenly on the sublimation machine, improving the transfer quality. Meanwhile, it allows the heating element to move safely to the side, reducing the chance of accidental contact.  </span></li>
<li><span class="a-list-item"> Dual-Tube Heating: Unlike ordinary single tube heating, our heat press 15 x 12 adopts the latest double-tube heating technology, which makes the temperature difference is only about 5℃ between the center and the edge, making the printing effect better.  </span></li>
<li><span class="a-list-item"> High-Security Performance: Thanks to the use of two layers of insulation technology, the surface temperature is only about 50-70℃, when the working temperature reaches 210℃. But the traditional shirt press machine's temperature can reach over 70℃ and might scald your hands.  </span></li>

<span>I want to start this our by saying that mine did not come put together and the instructions suck.<br/>With that being said, once I figured out what it was talking about, I was able to put it together no problem.<br/>My problem now comes with the mode. What is the mode and how do I know what I'm changing to?<br/>There are no clear instructions on how to use any of the items in here. And this being a newer model there aren't any videos or anything for people like me to learn to use this.</span>

<span>Item says comes fully assembled which it DOES NOT. lots of parts! Make sure you have someone handy to put it together.</span>

<span>First let me say I got this because it had so many attachments. I got one that said the packaging was damaged, not the unit itself. Yep, package was damaged but when I opened the box most things had already been opened and just stuck back in the box. On the base 4 of the screws were totally bent over I had to use a hammer to straighten them so I could pull them out and go to the hardware store to get new screws. The bottom plate was laying on top of the screws I just mentioned and has deep scratches in it. I am not impressed with the hat press at all, I have not tried the mug presses or pen press yet, I will be doing that this week. I don't think the hat press heats evenly. The connection for the press itself was bent almost flat but I was able to straighten it out enough to make it work. Yes, I was aware that the package was damaged but not every piece in the box as well, clearly it was used. See photos of the plate with all the scratches.</span>

<span>It takes a bit to warm up, kinda like an oven.  Once it's at temp though it does a good job staying there.<br/><br/>My husband put it together and didn't really have any issues.<br/><br/>It seems sturdy enough so far.</span>
