<span>Nice part of the Peak Design system. I use them on my Canon DSLRs with short(er) lenses as an alternate to the neck strap that can get in the way of the BBF button. Would not use with my long zooms that come with a support collar. Just the right length. Tried others that were either too long, didn't fit the camera right or did not offer the same level of security. Not concerned with camera weight as the P-D tabs have a fair tensile strength and the locking mechanism is good. All said, these work well if you like camera wrist straps. It's a personal decision.</span>

<span>however it's not comfortable at all and the metal piece may scratch your camera or other devices in your bag<br/><br/>When you are walking you cannot let go your camara from it's grip because it will be swinging all over the place putting the weight to strangle your wrist</span>

<span>Peak Design has some of the best camera gear you can find, I especially love the quick connector on their products.<br/><br/>I wanted a small light, yet sturdy camera strap to attached to my Sony RX100M7 and this product suited that need well -- Except for getting the loop through the small strap anchors on the camera...kind of a pain. The quick connector makes it simple to attached, or detach,  your camera to the strap and when it's not in use the wrist strap has a magnet inside of the band enabling you to tuck away the flapping part of the strap -- letting you wear it like a wrist band.<br/><br/>The wrist strap is adjustable, has a firm grip, and uses the weight of the camera to keep the strap snug.<br/><br/>I tried using this with a slightly heavier camera (Olympus OMD EM5II) and when allowing the camera to dangle from my wrist I found the grip to be too tight. I wouldn't expect to carry heavier camera's and allow them to dangle while using this strap, at least not for a prolonged period of time -- (unless you prefer to hold your camera in your hand and have this is a safety strap). But for a small camera and light camera like the RX100 (or similar) it's perfect.</span>

<span>I just received the strap and have been looking forward to snorkeling with it. When it arrived I was anxious to try it on, as, some people said they did not fit large hands well. It was close for me but fit okay.<br/>But, sadly, as I was velcroing off one of the straps, instead of hearing the sound of velcro seperating, I heard stitches popping. Very disappointing, very. I am not even sure what to do now.</span>

<span>We bought this just before a trip to Hawaii and we’re so glad we did.  It is well built and met every expectation.<br/><br/>It comes with two straps: one that wraps around your wrist and one that wraps around your hand.  We tried both but used the hand strap exclusively.  The hand strap gives you a stable mount and a clear view of the GoPro screen while still allowing you to use your hand to swim.  The mount has a solid feel and includes a swivel 360 degree mount.<br/><br/>In the past we used a snorkel mask mount which was terrible if you cared at all about what you’re filming.  We also used the floating hand-held post but that made it difficult to swim.</span>

<span>Definitely worth purchasing the Go Pro Brand. I purchased an off brand previously and my camera came off the wrist band and sank to the bottom of the water. Thank goodness it was not that deep. Purchased this one and it has never come off because it is locked right in. Definitely worth spending the extra money to know that it won't come off.</span>

<span>Took my wife to Disney and wanted to vlog some of the rides. In used a back pack mount most of the day and this wrist strap for the rides. It worked perfectly and gave me plenty of adjustability. It was sturdy enough for my Insta360 on roller coasters where hand held options weren’t available. I give the product itself 5 stars. It’sa little pricey but it’s securing your camera which is even more expensive. Made it through 5 days and looks brand new still. Will update if any opinions change</span>

<span>This is a good "minimal" strap that takes up little space in a pack or pouch. I usually keep my camera in a pouch on my waist, and take it out when I want to shoot something. I still like to use a strap so I don't accidently drop the camera or if I need both hands for something. It's soft and comfortable and lightweight. and affordable. The "long" length is the right length for a neck strap. Recommended!</span>

<span>Using this wrist strap on my Voigtlander Bessa R3M.  That camera arrived without lug rings for attaching the neck strap - so couldn't attach the included neck strap.  I needed just the ring, but this strap looked decent and was a fair value.  The strap fits my wrist/hand just fine - I wear a large glove as reference.  Adds that extra security in the event the camera slips from my hand.  Other:  Secure stitching, good quality materials, slider adjustment  to cinch down on wrist, cotton looks good and is substantial, comes with ring and camera protector (at ring).</span>

<span>We used these on a beach vacation along with a phone protector for our cell phones (purchased from a different vendor).  We were able to use our cell phone in the ocean and while on a boat by attaching this float to the protector.

<span>I didn't know if this would work for me because it’s for cameras up to 7 oz or 200 grams. My Olympus TG-5 weighed in at 258 g (9.1 oz) but I decided to take a chance after calculating the underwater weight, which is what really matters for floating the camera. I measured the displacement of the camera by putting it in a measuring cup and filling it to 1 liter. I took the camera out and the level dropped to 800 ml so the camera displaced 200 ml. From that I calculated the underwater weight = 258 g - 200 ml * (1 g / ml) = 58 g. (Water weighs 1 g per ml.) I guessed that it would be able to float 58 g. After attaching one of the floats, I verified that it easily floated my camera. To get a better idea of the underwater weight capacity of the floats I used some combination wrenches. My 13 mm wrench floated easily. It has an underwater weight of 87 g - 11 ml * (1g/ml) = 76 g. A 14 mm wrench sunk quickly. It's underwater weight was 114 g - 14 ml * (1g/ml) = 100 g. You can get a much better idea of whether your camera will float or not by calculating the underwater weight this way. If it's close to or less than 76 g, it will float. If it's close to or over 100 g it will not float unless you use more than one float.<br/><br/>It's comfortable, sized right and appears to be constructed well. I used it on a recent cruise in the caribbean and it worked great.</span>

<span>PLEASE READ THIS:<br/>I bought the 2 pack Nordic floats 2 years ago, someone on here recommended to attach both to my Panasonic waterproof camera for double protection. Well, guess what happened, I was doing a jetski tour in NYC and I was taking pictures and video, I was a passenger as my grandson was driving. The water was choppy and wave after wave, we were going around 35mph, he hits a big wave and I go flying in the air, camera goes one way and I go another. I'm looking for the camera and see the yellow floats, I see one float and the other 10 feet from each other and the water is choppy as heck. I grab one float and guess what is attached to it, the camera, the camera is open....<br/>I get back on the jetski and I grab the broken float. When I got back to the dock an hour later, I look at the camera and it's shot, full of water (salt water) the battery is wet and so is the SanDisk, I take it out of the camera and wash it out with bottle water and dry it out. I wasn't sure if my picture were still there, I was using a 32gb, extreme pro ScanDisk. I had no way of checking. when I got back to Texas. I looked at the package of another one I bought that I had not used yet and guess what, it's waterproof and I had used 16gb of a 32gb. All my pictures and video were still there.

<span>I use one of these on every camera I own.  I also use a hand-strap (Joby) but always have one of these wrapped around my wrist just in case.<br/><br/>I can be a bit clumsy at times and the last thing I want to hear is the sound of my camera/lens smashing into the ground because for whatever reason I decided to let go of it at the wrong time.<br/><br/>Great product at a great price.</span>

<span> This blackrapid wrist strap I believe is the most valuable camera accessory i own to date. It may also be the most underrated camera accessory.<br/><br/>It's not the most expensive accessory I own but the value it has provided to me is immense. I had the chance to think about it for this video.<br/>-lessen my worries of dropping and destroying my investment.<br/>-made me take out my camera more to practice my craft.<br/>-allowed me to focus more on what matters the most.<br/>-i am able to handle the camera loosely (with the tip of my fingers)<br/>-the ability to hang even a heavy camera on my wrist is a plus<br/><br/>If i can think of a con here it's probably because i become complacent and let the camera swing on the strap and hit something. A table, wall or something. That would be terrible.</span>

<span>BlackRapid Breathe Wrist Camera Strap with FR-5 FastenR:  In a word, fantastic. I have been shooting ameteur photos with SLR’s and DSLR’s for many years.  I always used a shoulder strap and worried about it slipping down. (Sometimes with disastrous, $, results.) It was often awkward to take a photo. This high quality wrist strap solves all that:  a) Instant photos; b) Relaxed carry with no effort; c) Security;  d) Less conspicuous appearance.  The ¼-20 attachment seems foolproof.  Yes, I recommend it.</span>
