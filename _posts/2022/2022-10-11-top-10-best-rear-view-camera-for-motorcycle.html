<span>UPDATE-<br/>CS got ahold of me and will be sending out the replacement parts. In the meantime, I used the USB power cable to power the system for a 17 hour ride I just finished. There were a few corrupt files, but nothing major. I set the DVR for 5 minute loops (though they seem just short of that), at max resolution. This produced 288 files at about 251MB each (65GB total). I used the 256GB Samsung EVO SD card because that's the one they recommend at this size (they will recommend a different card if you get a smaller capacity). The mounting location worked well for me- despite the several hours of rain I encountered, the DVR was dry and the cameras more or less were clear. The front camera produced very good results (though not comparable to a GoPro), day and night, but the rear camera looks like the Billie, Jr, rear brake light from Clearwater may have tinted everything reddish, but that's not the system's fault. During the day it was as good as the front camera.<br/><br/>Naming convention is yyyymmdd_hhmmss, followed by A (front), or B (rear). Takes some getting used to.<br/><br/>I haven't done anything with the video, like create a travel video or the like. I only opened them with the default Windows 10 player.<br/><br/>At first it may seem that signage isn't legible, but I was able to pause the video and read the billboards and road signs (daytime), but license plates and signs at night (unless there's other illumination), are just out of reach. Still, this system is a "big picture" thing- it'll show the authorities what happened; they don't need to know the brand of makeup Ms. Distracted Driver was putting on when she hit you.<br/><br/>I'm looking forward to getting more usage from this product.<br/><br/>Original review follows-<br/>This product came to me DOA due to a non-working 12v to 5v cable (the one used to hardwire the DVR to the vehicle. The thing works if connected to a battery pack. No value for the money if a key component is busted/not working.<br/><br/>The mounts themselves look flimsy but seem to hold well, at least while sitting in the garage. It looks like the ones shipping now seem to have that issue of them not tightening enough resolved because I haven't had any issues with the camera moving in the very short time I've had it.<br/><br/>They claim that these are Sony cameras, but you won't find a single Sony logo anywhere on them.<br/><br/>The manufacturers website doesn't even have this product listed anywhere.<br/><br/>Motorcycle dash cam with the heart of the system not waterproof. Makes sense.<br/><br/>There is a watch battery in the DVR, supposedly to help the unit finish writing to the SD card when the power shuts-off. You won't find this information in the instructions or on the website (the latter because like I said, this product isn't listed); nope, I found this out on the ADV forums.<br/><br/>The cable lengths were spot-on for my needs; you mileage may vary.<br/><br/>Apparently it makes a difference that you run the GREEN color-coded camera at the front. I had happily accidentally placed the black camera in the rear (probably because I'm 'racist'?, LOL), sooo...<br/><br/>Actually, there isn't any info on that- I think I saw that in the ADV forums as well. I believe dude was told about it from someone from CS. I dunno, I just write things here.<br/><br/>The DVR screen is viewable through the silicone cover during daylight in my garage with the lights on and door opened, but not sure in direct sunlight. The cover is easy to put on and get off. #Rule34<br/><br/>They are recommending to get the Samsung EVO card if putting in a 256GB SD card. That's what I did. Make sure you follow their ratings.<br/><br/>The bike is a 2016 BMW RT. I removed and left out the stock speakers (they suck anyhow). Went for a ride with the DVR just sitting as you see in the pictures and it didn't budge (I don't have it attached to anything at the moment).</span>

<span>I have been using a helmet camera from a different manufacturer for years now.  It is on its last legs.  Ninety percent of the time, I was using this helmet camera as a "dash" camera, in case I was run off the road, got into an accident, or whatever.  So I was looking for a trouble-free solution where I could get video from the front of my motorcycle as well as the rear.  I wanted something that would be powered by the motorcycle and not have a limitation of two hours as so many "action" cameras have before the battery runs out.  And I wanted something discreet so I wouldn't have to worry about it being stolen.  After doing a lot of research, I decided on the HaloCam M1.  I highly recommend it.<br/><br/>What attracted me to the HaloCam M1 was a couple things.  First, it has 1080p cameras on the front and rear.  I don't know much about the cameras, but I do know that Sony is a good name brand, and they are using Sony cameras.  That's a plus.  The other big plus in my mind, was the wi-fi capability.  Trying to aim your cameras without being able to see what you're doing in real time is a pain.  The HaloCam M1 comes with a nice app for a smartphone that allows you to see what the cameras see in real time.  You can also download your videos without touching the DVR unit, and even make changes to the settings from the app.  It's slick.<br/><br/>I was impressed with the HaloCam M1 from even the time I opened the box.  These people have spent a lot of thought in how they package their product, and from using the camera, that extra thought has gone into the design as well.<br/><br/>When you open the box,  you'll see the DVR unit along with the two cameras and the manual switch neatly arranged.  They look like quality equipment even then.  Lift that packaging up and you'll see the cords neatly tucked away underneath.  They use a short cord attached to each item like the cameras with a longer section to run from that camera to the DVR unit.  Everything is color coded.  You can't mess this up in the installation.  Even the color coded plugs have only one way to plug them in.  You can't mess it up.  And they include heat shrink tubing that you can use to guarantee the connections are waterproof.  They have thought of everything.<br/><br/>Installation is straight-forward.  Mount the front and rear cameras.  Mount the GPS device they include.  And mount the manual switch.  Then find places on your motorcycle to hide the wires and plug them into the DVR.  The last thing is to find a good power supply.<br/><br/>You'll want a power connection that turns off when the ignition is turned off.  Otherwise, the camera will continue to record and you'll run your battery down.  I connected mine to the tail light circuit.  I have a BMW, and there's a lot of concern about the CANBUS system having errors when you do this.  I had no problems with mine.  There's also a USB power connector that you can use to power the camera.  Again, very well thought out.<br/><br/>One note.  The DVR does not have any built in memory storage.  You'll need to supply your own SDHC memory card.  Use a high speed memory card for this, since you're recording from two cameras and with sound.<br/><br/>What is it like in use?  I've attached three screen captures.  The sequence might be off when this is posted, so let me explain what is happening.  The rear camera shows a white vehicle merging behind me on the freeway.  Another picture shows the blue car that was behind it, moving up fast.  He could've easily merged behind me, but instead he accelerates to cut in front of me with little room to spare.  You can see the entire sequence of events being captured as the car moves from the rear camera to the front one.  If there had been an accident, that sequence of events was captured.<br/><br/>This is not an "action" camera, yet one of the sales people at Cycle Gear mentioned that the video I showed her was as good or better than her Go Pro.  I don't know if I'd go that far.  As an "action" camera, I'd rate it as "very good", but I don't believe this was designed as an action camera.  As a "dash" camera though, I'd rate it as exceptional.  The quality of everything is excellent, and the price is great.<br/><br/>I have only one nit-pick...  When you mount the cameras in their mounts, they are still a little lose when the screw is tightened all the way.  The "fix"...just use another washer on the inside of the two arms of the mount that holds the camera and it'll tighten just fine.  That is really minor.  You'll see what I mean when you mount yours.<br/><br/>Lastly, I have to make a comment about the HaloCam customer service.  It is exceptional.  I notice that of the previous reviews, one person had issues with his camera.  I did too initially.  I contacted them and they were outstanding in resolving my issue.  I don't know when I've had better customer service.  They definitely stand by their product.<br/><br/>Pros:<br/>* This is plug and play.  Install it, and forget about it.<br/>* If you want the videos for sharing or for evidence in case of an accident, you can download them with your smartphone.<br/>* There's nothing left out.  This includes a GPS unit to share with your friends where you were riding.  It even seems to have a vibration sensor so that if you are in an accident, it will "lock" that video segment from being overwritten for evidence.<br/>* The quality of all the components is first class.  I don't see where they cut any corners in delivering a great camera system.<br/>* Installation is easy.  They have thought out how to make this fool-proof for you.<br/>* The videos are excellent.  Even at night.<br/>* The price is great for what you get.<br/><br/>Cons:<br/>* An extra washer would be nice.  (I had to come up with something!)  :D<br/>* The DVR is not waterproof.  Just the cameras, GPS and manual switch are.  So if you have the DVR unit mounted somewhere that it can get wet, put it in a plastic bag.</span>

<span>8-24-21 Update<br/><br/>After all the failures that are documented in the original review with the HaloCam M1 camera system and with the HaloCam company I contacted Amazon, again, earlier this month, after the second base unit continued to turn itself off and repeatedly failed to find its’ own WIFI and could not be turned back and used on for hours. After Amazon reviewed the documentation of the old and new failures of the company and the unit they immediately, and without question, refunded the full purchase price.<br/><br/>Here are a few things I have learned:<br/>1- Amazon is the only place I found where the HaloCam M1 is sold.<br/>2- I could not find an 800 number or website for HaloCam for help.<br/>3- HaloCam is one of the top worst companies I have come across at responding to email, (I had to get their email address from Amazon). They did not respond to email sent by Amazon on my behalf.<br/>4- From my experience it appears HaloCam does not want to be bothered helping people that purchased  their product and expect their help when the original and replacement HaloCams repeatedly exhibit problems and failures.<br/><br/>I thank Amazon for stepping up, twice, to help, both times because this company failed to do so.<br/><br/>I repeat: Bottom line: the HaloCam M1 is, by far, the worst product I have ever purchased for a motorcycle!<br/><br/>My original review:<br/><br/>Based on the reviews I read and videos I watched on YouTube I thought the HaloCam M1 would be a good choice for a motorcycle dual camera system. I was very wrong.<br/><br/>The HaloCam M1 and what the company called “customer service” was nowhere close to being worth what I paid, on Amazon, during Amazon Prime days in 2020.<br/><br/>Based on my experience, the HaloCam M1 unit and the lack of useful “customer service” they provided I would never spend $142.89 for another unit, let alone the $257.00 they are asking for it on Amazon today.<br/><br/>Noted below is information that reflects some of the problems I experienced with the HaloCam M1. After having no success reaching anyone at the company by phone I spent weeks exchanging emails with people at the company, in China, that did not help solve the problems, so I contacted Amazon for help. The problems were explained to a C/S manager at Amazon. Unfortunately, she was unable to get anyone at HaloCam to reply to her phone calls or emails. Because on that, and to her credit, she provided me with a new unit. Unfortunately, that second unit turned out to be as problem riddled as the first. Here are some of the issues I had and still have with the M1 unit:<br/><br/>1- The DVR does not automatically start recording when the ignition is turned on. The Halo app has to be manually started, from the phone, every time the ignition is turned on.<br/><br/>2- When running more than the Halo app on my phone the M1 will disappear from the screen (turns itself off) on my phone and has to be restarted manually to resume recording. About 75% of the time that this happens the phone no longer sees the Wi-Fi from the HaloCam M1 and WIFI the unit no longer functions.<br/><br/>3- The DVR randomly disconnects itself from the phone riding down the road. The phone no longer shows the Wi-Fi from the HaloCam M1 as a WIFI option to select to connect the phone to.<br/><br/>4- Every time I go to start the app from my phone it takes up to 8 tries before the phone and the unit connect and the DVR starts recording.<br/><br/>5- A split view showing the view from both cameras, at the same time, is not possible on the phone.<br/><br/>6- The live video playing on the screen of the phone is very choppy.<br/><br/>I was looking for a product that worked and was easy to use right out of the box. The two HaloCam M1 units I received were not that product. Because of the problems I had with the product I needed a customer service experience that provided solutions. My customer service experience with HaloCam was even worse than the performance of the HaloCam M1 system.<br/><br/>Bottom line: the HaloCam M1 is, by far, the worst product I have ever purchased for a motorcycle!</span>

<span>I purchased this to install on my Goldwing in February of 2020.  Installation was pretty easy since I'm very familiar with the bike and how to take the plastic off of it.  I was able to get everything up and working and even tested it on a ride around the neighborhood.  I liked the fact that I could pull up the DVR portion and watch the video as I rode to see if there were any issues with the cameras or anything.  Here's the "but...." in my headline.  Worked great until I got a new iPhone 11 Pro Max and upgrade to IOS 14 on it.  I have not been able to get the DVR to connect on the phone.  I still have my iPhone X and it's running the old code on it, IOS 13.5 and it works great.  But I hate to carry two phones on the bike with me.  I have the Pro Max setup with a wireless charger mount on the handlebar, but no place to mount the X and have power run to it while riding.  I have tried removing the app, deleting the cached data, deleting the network info for the HaloCam DVR, tried resetting the DVR, but nothing will work.  Keeps telling me "Search device timeout" after just a few seconds of trying to connect.  In the box where it lists the WiFi, normally it would pull up the HaloCam device, but with the new IOS 14, it won't pull it up.  I believe it has something to do with the addition of the "Private Wi-Fi Address" in the new code, but even disabling that for the connection to the DVR, it still won't find the DVR.<br/><br/>I have sent an email to service@aidrive.com but have not received a reply back yet.  Unfortunately, I can't downgrade the code on the iPhone 11 because they have removed all the signed copies of IOS 13 so you can't downgrade any longer.  Hope the manufacturers of this device will address this with a new code release so that it works properly.  I love the system and it still works like it should from what I can tell, but not being able to connect my new iPhone to it is a real downer.</span>

<span>So far the cam is good. I had high expectations about the App. I thought you would have full access to it at all times. In order to access the camera with your phone you need to be in the car and go through the cam menu to connect to the phone. If someone breaks into your car then you will loose the footage.  its just and easier way to download videos without taking the sim card off. I don’t know if it is my internet but sometimes the videos won’t download using the app. Also there were not clear instructions on how to use the gps. I think I need to install a different app in order to use it.<br/> I didn’t like the mounting hardware. I would prefer suction cup.<br/>I was trying to find a second set of cables so  I can have them installed in my other car. The idea is to swap the cameras without having to pull the cables from the panels. I found the front cam power supply but no luck with rear cam cable. The one I ordered almost work but the plug end was too small.</span>

<span>After having it for about a month now, here is my opinion.<br/> First, The packaging is nice and adds an element of "high end" electronics. Inside is packed with everything one needs to install and more. There are extras in the event I want to reinstall in a different vehicle and also has the tool for tucking and hiding the wires which is a nice addition.<br/>  The camera itself is very nice looking yet small enough to not create a blind spot. The rear camera is small and inconspicuous if installed correctly. I mounted the rear cam inside, on the roof looking out the back window, so it has a nice wide viewing angle. The rear cam can also be hooked up to the reverse lights so that it becomes a backup cam when the vehicle is put in reverse. The main camera feels well made and not cheap and the touch screen is very responsive giving the feel of a high end cell phone. I love the feature of just touching the right side of the screen to toggle through: Full screen main cam, Main cam with rear cam in window overlayed, rear cam with main cam in overlayed window and full screen rear cam.<br/>  The video from the main cam is great quality (although I don't think it is true 4k) but still better than full 1080p hd. It clearly captures license plate numbers in front within a reasonable distance. The PC and Phone/tablet apps are nicely laid out with both the video and GPS map. Although I can't get them to synchronise on any of my computers, tablets or phones, and one of my computers is a custom built recording studio computer that has massive amounts of RAM and storage that runs in Mac or P.C. and still can't get the video to play smoothly or synchronize with the gps. So I definitely think that the apps still need work to speed them up. I can, however, get the videos to play smoothly if I open them up as just a video without GPS using a video playing app. If I had to pick 1 thing I don't like and/or needs to be redesigned, It would be the release button. I can't and don't leave the cam in my car when I'm parked due to the heat. Just going to the store and home for a total of about 30 minutes heats this thing up so much that It is actually too hot to touch. Given the ridiculously hot summer this has been, I don't know if it's only the heat from the sun or a combination of sun and operating temp. So, Every time I get home, I remove the cam from the bracket using the release button and it is a major pain in the @$$. I know exactly where the button is, as I can feel it, but I still spend 5 or 10 minutes trying to get the camera to release from the mounting bracket. It should definitely have the button on the front somewhere or a much larger release mechanism. Due to the type of car, the angle of my windshield and the very limited space in my car, reaching the windshield just below my rear view mirror is quite difficult, and made harder by the steering wheel pressing into my chest and the fact that I have to fight with the camera just to get it off without ripping the entire mount off the glass in this heat is enough to make me pretty irritable. Also, I know that people leave it in their car at night because it will record any disturbances to the vehicle but if some one is going to break into a vehicle to steal anything worth money, they are probably going to grab this camera first, defeating the purpose of it being there in the first place.<br/>  Having said that about the release button, I still do like this cam and think it is worth the price and would highly recommend it to anyone. It is for this reason and because all the pro's out weigh the 1 con that I still give it a 5 star rating.</span>

<span>I purchased this Kingslim dashboard camera to replace one that I had since 2015 and recently broke. It comes with a front and rear camera. They were both easy to mount in my car (the hardest part was peeling the backing off the red adhesive sticker). I haven't had a chance to hard wire the rear camera to the back of the car, so in the meantime, I mounted it right behind the ceiling in the backseat. The picture quality of the front camera is excellent and it captures a lot of details. The picture quality of the rear camera is not as good as I am unable to see license plates numbers for the cars behind me, but this could be due to the camera being mounted inside the car, as opposed to the outside (like above the back license plate). The front camera can be removed from the GPS mount, but it does take quite a bit of effort to press the notch back before the camera can be released. I wish dismounting the camera would be easier. However, the touch screen is a nice feature, and the cameras are both reliable and I haven't encountered any issues with them so far. Overall, this dashcam is pretty decent, takes great quality videos, and I hope this will serve me for many years to come!</span>

<span>It’s working great! Instillation was fast an easy. I knew I didn’t want to attach it to my starter fuse or use the cigarette lighter so I bought an ODT 2 adaptor which works fabulous! The picture quality is great and the night vision is clear. Clips range from 20 seconds to 6mins and each clip gives location and even the journey from point A to point B!<br/><br/>Not long after I had it I actually ended up in an accident. I was able to review clear audio and visual which helped process and understand what happened.  I especially like the emergency impact folder. Anything that jars the car a certain amount ends up there which is helpful to divide the videos.<br/><br/>It really only works with Samsung SD card. I tried others and they didn’t work.<br/><br/>The rear camera is also clear and functioning and even works well with tinted windows lightest to darkest without any issues whether it’s day or night.<br/><br/>The camera does record when the car is off but conserves battery by only recording certain close movements or car jarring. It also has different screen functions where you can have both camera feeds showing, just one or none.<br/><br/>The only thing I didn’t like was the phone function. It promised easy access phone connection and Wi-Fi but the process  and set up is difficult and confusing. You can’t view the feed from your phone unless your right next to the camera so there’s no way to check on it from far away like you can with Tesla cameras. You also have to connect to the cameras Wi-Fi in order to see the video which means any access to the cameras functions are cut off. Also downloading one 3 minute clip on to your phone takes at least 10-20mins.<br/><br/>Because of this i give it 4 stars.</span>

<blockquote><em><div class="a-row a-spacing-small review-data"><span class="a-size-base review-text review-text-content" data-hook="review-body">
<span>After about a month of reading reviews and comparing manufacturers and models, I finally settled on this Viofo A129 Pro Duo 4K setup.<br/><br/>When I received the cameras, I was impressed with the look and feel of the units and accessories.  The build quality is very good and doesn't feel overly plasticky.  I powered the cameras up, installed and formatted the 128GB micro SD card, and set up the features as I wanted them.  Everything seemed to work just fine.<br/><br/>The next day, I spent about an hour installing it in my car and I was really excited to see how the cameras would perform.  Again, everything powered up just fine and both the front and back cameras started recording.  However, about 1 minute in, I noticed the front camera (main camera) reboot on its own.  Although I thought it was strange, I figured it may just be a minor power hiccup that caused the camera to glitch, so I didn't think much of it.  But about a minute or two later, it happened again.  Then again a couple of minutes after that. The camera just kept rebooting on its own every few minutes.  I checked all the connections and wires and everything looked just fine.<br/><br/>Stumped, I went back in the house and decided to Google search "Viofo reboot..." and Google filled in the rest... "Viofo rebooting loop" and came up with quite a few hits on complaints from customers experiencing the same or similar rebooting issues... some even worse.  Apparently, Viofo cameras have had this problem for years and still continue to have them to this day.<br/><br/>The next day, I discovered that if I unplug the rear camera, the front camera works just fine... doesn't reboot at all.  But as soon as I plug that rear camera back in, the problem starts back up again.  I also noticed that the hotter the weather, the shorter the reboot loops. So if it's a really hot day, the camera would reboot every 7-10 seconds.  But as the car cools down with the AC on, the reboot would happen every 30 seconds, then every 50 seconds then maybe every minute or two as the car and the unit continued to cool down.  So the issue, although not caused by the heat,  is definitely exasperated by it.<br/><br/>So, you might be thinking "why don't you just return it".  Well, unfortunately, I live in South America and had the unit shipped down using a courier service.  So, returning the camera would be costly and frankly, too much of a hassle.  So, I've decided to keep it and use it as best I can.  The camera does work well on cooler days, so at least there's that.  But I did shell out $250 for this supposed top-notch dash cam, so it is a bit of a pill to swallow.<br/><br/>On the plus side, the app is pretty decent and does work well on my iPhone (I don't know what other users are complaining about) and the GPS and WiFi features are nice. Parking mode is a bit of a mystery to me, though.  I've set it up to record in timelapse, but it just keeps on recording in regular mode. Maybe that's just me doing something wrong.  Also, the image quality is pretty good on the front camera, but not $250 good.  And the rear camera is just OK... also not worth $250.  In fact, the $65 single cam I had in my previous car had better image quality than the rear camera here... and they're both 1080P.<br/><br/>Overall, considering the fact that this is a known issue that Viofo has never bothered to fix, you never know if you'll be the lucky recipient of a faulty unit.  Based on that,  I wouldn't recommend this camera.</span>

<span>I just bought an A129 Pro Duo to replace a Mini0906 (that thing was NOT one of the best cams like dashcamtalk claimed, but was a complete turd).<br/><br/>=== Let's get the negatives out of the way:<br/><br/>On the A129 Pro Duo, the wifi feature is not broadcasting. I have tried 2.4GHz, 5GHz auto, and 5GHz forced to channel 40, and 5GHz forced to channel 36, and forced to 161; the SSID is never broadcast. As the MAC is not listed on the device (SHAME ON YOU, VIOFO!), I checked for new APs without an SSID and toggled wifi on and off, and no new MACs showed up, so it appears wifi is totally nonfunctional.<br/><br/>It is otherwise a fantastic unit and I will be updating the review after I test night recording. I'm docking four stars as one of the reasons I bought this unit was wifi connectivity, and yet, I will be forced to pull the microsd card and use dashcamviewer to review footage. WTF, VIOFO? Fix the firmware please. Docking four stars for this.<br/><br/>Also, Mini USB connectors? Why not USB-C? WTF? If you had used USB-C I could have prewired my car before the camera arrived.<br/><br/>No volume setting for that infernal beep? Only On/OFF? I want the beep, I just don't want it to be eardrum-piercingly and nerve-gratingly loud. Do us a solid and give us a volume control for the beep, please, even if it's just "LOUD - MEDIUM - SOFT - OFF"<br/><br/>And, why not a full kit which includes the hardwire kit, bluetooth remote and polarizing filters for both the front and rear cameras?<br/><br/>OK, so with all the negatives that garnered a 1-star rating (only because I could not rate it zero) out of the way:<br/><br/>=== Positives<br/><br/>1. IT HAS A SCREEN! I skipped the Thinkware U1000 because even though it's objectively a better product, I wanted an integrated screen in case WiFi fails<br/>2. DAY, FRONT Video quality is GREAT - at least in daylight (I will update this review over time).<br/>3. It is easy to install<br/>4. I like that there is a prewiring kit and a customizable parking mode (again, I will update this over time)<br/>5. I like the visual recording, wifi, and mic LED indicators so I can check without having to wake up the screen<br/>6. THANK YOU for implementing a screen timeout/"screen saver" feature. With most dashcams with screens, I need to manually turn the screen on and off. It's nice being able to tap a button and check status and let it time out and turn off on its own<br/>7. I like that it's low profile and will not interfere with the visor as much as other models do.<br/>8. I like the faint LED in the GPS mount; with the camera pulled off the mount, I can see that the GPS mount is receiving power<br/>9. I like that WiFi can theoretically be toggled on/off with the overlay button (I say theoretically because WiFI actually doesn't work at all)<br/>10.<br/><br/>=== Suggested improvements:<br/><br/> * Switch over to all USB-C connectors<br/> * Support 1TB+ MicroSD cards<br/> * Allow your app to read MicroSD cards (since wifi doesn't work at all)<br/> * Implement a more active cooling scheme (phase changing heat pipe + maybe a fan)<br/> * Cloud recording/storage/vehicle tracker/locator connectivity: Cloud connectivity? (I'd subscribe for $5 to $10/month if you would archive 30+ days of coverage and allow easy merging/exporting from the cloud - this would be a nice recurring revenue stream for you)<br/> * Car locator feature (easy with GPS + cloud connectivity), with live view<br/> * Android Auto/Carplay integration to use rear channel as rearview mirror in infotainment for those of us who drive vehicles with useless back windows (sportscars, trucks, etc.)<br/> * a full kit which includes the hardwire kit, bluetooth remote and polarizing filters for both the front and rear cameras?<br/> * 3 channel support<br/> * higher quality sensors both front and rear &lt;---&lt;&lt;<br/> * flip screen or android auto plugin to display either channel, use rear channel as supplemental rearview mirror view<br/><br/>=== Update day 2:<br/><br/>I haven't recorded any footage for a review/sample video yet; I have been playing with parking mode settings and H.265 vs. H.264 and when I used H.265 and let parking mode run overnight and retrieved it in the morning, the camera was so hot it felt scalding - it hadn't been in the sun yet and the car interior was still cool. I did not have my IR thermometer handy so I did not actually measure it but I'd guess it was 70c at the very least. I was nervous letting it run in my Stinger so I disabled H.265 and reduced the video bitrate from maximum to high.<br/><br/>Resolution maximum, WDR enabled, bitrate Maximum, EV = 0, rural/light suburban roads:<br/><br/>Reviewing day footage on 4K screen w/Dashcam Viewer, I can easily read license plates of cars I am following. It is very difficult to find any frames where license tags of oncoming cars are readable. However, nighttime capture of registration tags are not readable. There is much blooming which of course obscures much of the scene.<br/><br/>Rear channel, 1080p:<br/><br/>Reviewing night footage, WDR enabled, bitrate Maximum, EV = 0, rural/light suburban roads:<br/><br/>License tags of oncoming and following cars unreadable. Rear camera underexposed, difficult to make out detail on rural roads, cannot read following vehicles' plates (expected). Basically, meets expectations, provides some protection.<br/><br/>== Exchange<br/><br/>VIOFO want me to send the camera in for exchange. If it comes to that I'll do an Amazon exchange, returning the replacement box with the old camera since I had already installed the cables and tossed the package in recycling. I was hoping they'd come back with "Oh the firmware is buggy and here's an update"  :-(  On the bright side they respond fairly quickly.<br/><br/>=== Corrections to previous complaint:<br/><br/>Time DOES appear to update automagically via GPS.<br/><br/>=== Update: ===<br/><br/>I received a replacement - I submitted a support ticket and they made the exhange super easy, with advance shipment of the dashcam. I am pleased to report that the wifi features work on the replacement camera. I am happy with the unit so far. The high temperature does concern me a bit though.</span>

<span>Camera looks so much better than my old apeman and it's nice to have a rear cam too.<br/><br/>The cables provided offered ample reach for me in my Prius C hatchback. I directed the rear through the upper trim, and this left me feet of cable to spare. Doing it via the lower trim wouldn't have been enough cable as it's quite a long way around. If you have an enormous suv you might be ok, I can't say.<br/><br/>I don't drive at night much so I can't attest to the nighttime quality.<br/><br/>The wifi feature is so nice as this allows me to keep the memory card in and just pull the vids off.

<span>After trying several different dash cams I decided to keep this one because it checks all the boxes for the features I was looking for.<br/><br/>- 4K resolution for the front camera - The footage looks great and it’s easy to make out details like license plate numbers compared to lower resolution 1080/HD cameras. <br/>- Separate rear camera that is powered by the front camera - I wanted a rear camera both to capture what’s going behind me (in case somebody rear ends me, etc.) and also to provide even wider coverage while the car is parked. I didn’t want to have to run separate power cables for the rear camera. With this setup there is just a single USB cable that runs from the front camera to the rear camera to provide power and also receive the video signal from the rear camera. <br/>- Parking mode that will start recording when motion is detected while parked - I like the security that parking mode provides in case you come back to your car and something uncool has happened while you were parked. Some cameras either don’t have this option or have it but will only record when the camera detects an actual impact to the car. The Viofo camera allows you to select from several trigger events including impact, motion detection, even constant recording at a lower frame rate (such as 1 frame per second constant recording). I have mine set on motion detection and it works great. Anytime any motion is detected within the frame the camera will start recording. <br/>- Easy review and transfer of video on cell phone - The front camera does have a screen on it that is convenient for the initial setup of the camera to make sure you have the front and rear cameras positioned in a way that gives the view you want. You can also review the recorded video on the screen, but it’s a lot easier to simply connect your phone to the camera via wifi and review the clips on your phone screen. You can also easily save the clips to your phone so you don’t really ever need to remove the memory card from the camera. The app on the phone can also be used to change all the various configuration settings in a much easier interface than what you’ll find on the camera screen. As a bonus you can quickly turn the camera wifi on and off with a physical button on the camera. I simply leave the wifi off and only turn it on when I need it. <br/>- Hardwiring kit that will cut off the camera power if needed to prevent car battery from getting too low - The hardwiring kit is NOT included, but you can pick it up on Amazon at a decent price. The kit includes a little interface box that allows you to select between 4 different voltage cutoff settings so you won’t come back to a dead battery from your camera recording in parking mode.  <br/>- Design that allows mounting without obstructing the view out the windshield - Some of the other cameras I tried used more of a “landscape” orientation with a wide camera body and the lens on one side. When I put these cameras behind my rearview mirror they tended to stick out just enough that I could see them in my field of view while driving. The Viofo camera uses a “portrait” layout where the camera body is taller rather than wider. The lens is at the bottom of the body so you can stick the camera at almost the very top edge of your windshield. I have mine positioned so the camera mounting tape is actually attached to the black dot area at the top of the windshield with just the lens section protruding down into the clear glass area. The entire camera fits behind my rear view mirror and is completely out of view while I’m driving. This also gives the camera a factory look from outside the car and doesn’t look like some aftermarket item is just stuck on the windshield in the middle of the clear area.  PRO TIP: Make sure that you mount the camera so it is within the swiping path of your windshield wipers, otherwise you won’t get anything on video if it’s raining.<br/><br/>In the box you get the front and rear cameras, a power cable with cigarette lighter/12 volt socket adapter (you won’t use this if you buy the hardwiring kit), the cable to connect the two cameras together, a mini USB to USB-A cable you can use to connect the camera to your computer (you likely won’t use this either), some stick on clips you can use to route the wiring, a small pry tool that might come in handy when routing the cables in your car, some extra mounting tape pads, and a microSD card adapter for your computer.<br/><br/>Things you’ll need that aren’t included: <br/>- MicroSD card - You’ll need this to use the camera. A high endurance one is recommended since those cards are designed to be constantly overwritten as happens with dash cams. <br/>- Viofo hardwiring kit - You don’t absolutely need this, but without it you won’t be able to use parking mode and your installation will likely look like amateur hour. I consider this a necessity. <br/>- Add a circuit / fuse taps - You’ll need two of these to go along with the hardwiring kit. Just get the kind that use whatever fuse type your car uses. You’ll connect one to a constant power source in the fuse box and the other to a switched power source in the fuse box.<br/><br/>Overall highly recommended setup. Does everything more expensive setups do and actually does some things better.</span>

<span>I installed it in 2001 Nissan Altima. I put the back camera on top of the license plate and connect it to the reverse light.<br/>Pros:<br/>- After sales support is AMAZING. They contact me a couple of days after I received the package. That's why I give 4 stars instead of 3.<br/>- Price is reasonable.<br/>- Both cameras' result are just fine.<br/>- Installation was simple.<br/>- the charger head is small enough to be inserted inside the center console. I like it.<br/>Cons:<br/>- the user guide for adjustment menu is not adequate. Don't know how to use the menu. They gave me the link to more complete guide online after I gave a complaint.<br/>- sometimes the mirror is a bit shaky. You'll need other additional straps or velcro or double tape to make it not shaking.<br/>- LCD screen is quite hard to be seen in bright daylight.<br/>- the power cable a bit shorter if you want to route it on the sides and not crossing the floor mats.<br/>- the on screen parking guide lines seems created as it is for back camera installation only on the back windshield, not on the license plate. Since I installed it on the license plate, it looks weird going up like a ladder and not presenting distance perspective. Far from accurate. Don't rely on them when you backup! It's useless. It's different with the other backup camera brand I installed in my other car's license plate.</span>

<span>So far after two weeks everything is going well.<br/>It's a great setup for $40!<br/>Pros:<br/>+Only $40.<br/>+Easy setup if you're at all handy. Check YouTube for your specific car.<br/>+Picture seems really clear from front camera. Haven't tried to view any footage on a computer yet.<br/>+Only $40.<br/>+It makes your rearview mirror about 25% bigger, but it isn't obtrusive.<br/>+Did I mention it's only $40?<br/>Cons:<br/>- It's only a $40 device. There's reason why some cost hundreds.<br/>- Some online reviews mentioned this type of rear camera is susceptible to water penetration, so I used clear silicone caulk to try and prevent that.<br/>- Field of vision on the rear camera seems small. It's tough to get both close to my car and also see cars behind. I'm still fussing with it.<br/>- Instructions are a poor translation to English. The company did immediately send, without me asking, a link to get better instructions. Thumbs up to them.<br/>- UI is pretty cumbersome and not intuitive. I'm still just pressing random buttons till it does what I want.<br/>- It's only $40.<br/><br/>So overall I'm very happy so far.<br/>Will adjust review as necessary.<br/><br/>To all those asking questions. No, I don't know if it will fit in your OldsmoBuick, or ToyHondai. Do some research. Have you heard of YouTube? Or Google? Stupid questions will be ignored or replied with a snarky comment highlighting your stupidity.</span>

<span> UPDATE:  9/7/17 - I am removing a star for this review.  The Customer Service has been great and has worked to attempt to resolve my issue, but the issue is not resolved and doesn't appear to be resolvable.<br/><br/>- ISSUE:  The rear camera fails to continuously record.<br/><br/>- Elaboration:  The front camera records in continuous mode flawlessly, I have zero issue as a front recording device.  When using the Rear camera, it will record until the SD card is full, and then stop recording.  The front camera continues to remove old files and record new files like it is supposed to in the continuous loop setting, but the rear camera ceases to record after the SD card reaches capacity unless you reformat the SD card, then the cycle repeats again.  Customer Service did offer to make sure I had the correct settings (I did), and offered to replace the Rear camera thinking the camera might be defective, however, I believe this is a software/firmware issue.<br/><br/>- This is still a fantastic FRONT facing camera option that doesn't rely on suction cups (which I still very much love not having suction cups falling off anymore), but the REAR camera options seem a little unreliable over time which I believe is a flaw in how the device handles continuous loop recording for the rear camera.  I'm still considering buying another one for my other vehicle and just not bothering with the rear view. would be nice if there was a cheaper version that excluded the rear camera.<br/><br/>:::: Original Review ::::<br/>This 5-star review is due to a combination of the Cost, Customer Service and Functionality of the Dash Cam.  This may not be a perfect $200 Dash Cam, so don't expect it to operate as smoothly as one.  The instructions included can get you basically started, but the downloadable PDF instructions are more clear on how to begin.<br/><br/>Firstly, the Customer Service department is responsive and great.<br/>I was having some issues at first, and before I submitted this review, I reached out to them and they responded within hours to help me resolve issues I was having getting my setup to function as I expected.<br/><br/>My Setup:<br/>* Forward Facing DashCam<br/>* Rear Facing cam mounted inside the cab facing out. Permanently on (Not hooked to reverse light).<br/>-- Rear camera footage seems dark, but I also have (factory) tinted windows.<br/>-- Picture of rear camera mount inside cab. I drilled one Very small hole in the plastic trim, the smallest bit I had, to mount it against the window.<br/>-- Picture on a very sunny day so you can see garage brightness and rear camera brightness<br/>* Video Clip is a stormy/cloudy/rainy day as a comparison to see capture quality in Non-Optimal conditions.<br/><br/>PROS:<br/>+ Inexpensive DashCam with high quality front video. Rear video is OK.<br/>+ Very solidly mounted. No more suction cups ever again. This thing is NOT going to fall off when you least expect it, ever!<br/>+ Feels like a permanent installed camera, no vibration.<br/>+ Functions great as a rear view mirror<br/>+ Video Display in mirror is crisp and clear and can be toggled on or off.<br/>+ Can view videos on the dash cam without having to remove SD Card, though I still prefer to watch them on the PC.<br/><br/>CONS:<br/>- Icons on the buttons could be better (CogWheel is generally "Settings" icon, but it is a Mode button on this camera)<br/>- Instructions would be better if the Button Icons were included within the instruction set instead of having to flip back and forth to see what button they're referring to.<br/>- Instructions state "Up and Down" arrows, while the arrows on the buttons are printed as Left and Right.<br/>- I have a standard mirror and it fits great and quite snug, but if you have a mirror with electronics in it, or much larger than the standard Rear View mirror, this may not fit well, or you may have to use some custom brackets or rubber bands to secure it to the mirror.</span>

<span>It was fairly easy to install and the quality is more than adequate, the only thing that really sucks about it is the crappy Android app. It takes quite a while to load in videos to watch from the app and I had some issues with it initially connecting. After restarting my phone it suddenly started asking to create a temporary wifi network for it and it's worked perfect since. The fact it's on the GPS mount is even better, as it's MUCH easier to remove it quickly.</span>

<span>SC400D. The camera seems solid, day videos are excellent, night videos will still have street lamp flare, they all do. But...What I'm now finding out and confirmed by Cobra is that if you have a second car and want to switch the camera by adding a second mount, your out of luck. They don't make it or sell it. You might see that they sell a similar mount for the SC200 but I've checked and it won't work for the SC400D.  Kind of said that cobra did not think that part out very well for such an expensive dash cam.  BTW, 20 mins to get through to customer service. The smart DriveHD app. for macOS is advertised as having a motion map view while viewing the video on computer, Customer service relates that this feature was removed. It's ridiculous that they advertise it as a feature but it's not actually there. Save some money and can use a different hardwired kit other than the one they sell. The one they sell doesn't even come with optional fuse links.  Get a kit that's 5V and 2.5 or 3A.  If the unit needs repair under warranty, you pay for shipping both ways.  In the end I'll keep the camera because of a good amazon warehouse deal I got or else I'd return it . I gave it 4 stars based on video quality alone. Other features I would give 1 or less stars.</span>

<span>picture quality is pretty good for such a small camera.  have had several of these over the years.  software locks up in extreme heat. camera still works but will not record.  this is a great camera system for this price range in my eyes.</span>
