<div class="slideshow-container">
<blockquote><em><div class="a-row a-spacing-small review-data"><span class="a-size-base review-text review-text-content" data-hook="review-body">
<span>Overall, I like these glasses. One can always wish it was cheaper, and the build quality leaves a little to be desired with the skin-facing cover panels being loose and ill-fitting.... But the photo and video quality was reasonable, battery life was at least the hour promised.<br/><br/>To change settings, you need to write a very specific text file, then upload it to a particular place in the file structure, but it works. I assume you can leave the time off, but if you don't, it'll set the time when you first turn it on, so you have to do that on schedule.<br/><br/>Biggest complaint: There's no SD card, so your only option to get the movies off is with the provided woven micro USB. I tried several others, and none of them worked. A genuine USB-C would have been way better, but really, just something that worked.<br/><br/>Given that I could lose or damage the cable, I returned the unit, but would buy another if they fix the above issues.<br/><br/> It was comfortable to wear, and I used them even when not recording. Lenses were polarized and on the darker side without being extreme. One I RTFM, it was easy to control. The case was nice. The frames are easier to scratch than the lenses, so be aware of that.<br/><br/>Lastly: No one seemed to notice I had video glasses. I wore them around a fair amount and never got questioned - even though I can see the lens quite plainly (and you can make a good argument it's not hidden), even in extended face to face conversations no one said anything.<br/><br/>I found the camera to point ~10 degrees more skyward than I would like, it's harder to see your own hands.<br/><br/>Almost a really good product, if you can live with the cable, it's worth getting.</span>

<span>These glasses are extremely underdeveloped and for a $200 gadget, not good quality, too cheap materials, the camera is less than great and the way to code the image and FPS quality on the .TXT file is for advanced users so get away if you’re not a computer savvy user. This is not a plug and play. Gave me less than the advertised 1 hour of battery  (47min after charging 8 hours NEW PRODUCT)…<br/>Not a great buy. Too expensive for the quality offered. Maybe $79 would be an expensive price for these, at $200 is out of the game.<br/>I’m returning them very disappointed after watching all the reviews this is way less than expected.</span>

<span>Does the jobs it’s specified to do. Just wished the frames were slightly less bulky and the lenses frames a bit bigger in height as the frames are always within my range of vision even when pushed to the very top of my nose and block a bit of the scenery.</span>

<span>I have camcorders but I am a crummy videographer. These camera glasses have finally allowed me to capture my grandkids bball games. The kids can check out their own games and relatives that can't make the games can watch them from my postings. I wish there were a zoom in and out feature and a way to mute some of the sound but overall I can't really complain. I have keepsakes the kids will be able to look back on and laugh when they were just getting started. If you want to capture games and you can't remember to move your camcorder or phone back and forth, give these a try, it's worth it.</span>

<span>The glasses essentially do what they are designed to do, but the controls are confusing. Half the time I wasn't sure if I was recording or not. The placement of the SD card is in a weird place. The glasses themselves look very stylish. Once you get the hang of the controls and learn how to aim the camera to take descent video and stills, it's an okay piece of tech.No rave reviews, but it can do the job.</span>

He wanted them for riding his bicycle.  unfortunately, the volume is not loud enough for him to enjoy them. we had to wait for the inclement. weather to pass but he did get to try them about five times.  We Wanted to return them, but the return window was closed. He did register the product so we will be reaching out to Bose.  Such a shame.  they look sharp but for just over 200 dollars I would have liked a longer return window for such a specialized product</span>

<span>I have always been a fan of Bose and they have historically had a quality of sound that always exceeded expectations.<br/><br/>I knew that there would be sacrifices with how these were designed.  the speakers are not bone conduction, they are just small and sit near your ear so you can't expect the same quality you would get from in-ear buds.  I knew this going in and overall I am willing to accept this loss of quality.  But that means that the product needs to have some additional quality to make up for it.<br/><br/>This is where we go from not-so-great to train wreck!<br/><br/>But first, some positives.  The concept is great.  The main reason to be content with sound quality is that the distance of the speakers to your ear is intentional and allows you to hear things in your environment.  You can hear is someone tries to talk to you while also listening to music and not disrupting anyone around.  If the review stops here then really there is nothing to "hate" and I would just say they are overpriced.<br/><br/>The built in mic is not usable for phone calls, there are some videos on YouTube that illustrate this.  I didn't buy these to make calls though, so for me this is a wash.  I would only say, don't add a feature at all if it is garbage because maybe that is resources that could have made these work for me.<br/><br/>The REAL BAD is the quality of the glasses themself.  The plastic is this lightweight, super shiny finish that just feels and looks embarrassingly cheap.  Without the gimmick of Bluetooth I would put these on the bottom rack of the glasses sold at a gas station with a hubcap attached to the restroom key.  But WITH the gimmick, I would STILL buy these - although I would expect the price to be around $30.<br/><br/>And finally THE ABSOLUTE DEAL KILLER is the lenses!!  My eyes actually felt like they were twitching funny after wearing these for a long time and then removing.  I think I understand why.  The polarization is not the same in each eye.  When I hold them in front of an LCD monitor and BARELY tilt the glasses the right lens darkens.  it is well within the natural range of motion where my head is still more strait than tilted when wearing these.  I am not an expert on polarization of lenses but my eyes do not like the additional strain these put on me.  That to me is sinful when your product are [explicit redacted - rhymes with ducking] glasses.<br/><br/>You will regret it if you click 'Buy'!</span>

Cam v3 is the 3rd generation of Wyze’s flagship camera, Wyze Cam. Like its predecessor Wyze Cam v3 lets you see and record 1080p video right from the Wyze mobile app. New to Wyze Cam v3 is its waterproof design allowing for outdoor installation with an IP65 rating. Wyze Cam v3 also takes advantage of an all-new Starlight Sensor which allows for extreme low-light performance and shows great detail in the dark. With Wyze Cam v3's color night viewing, night time video recording appears as if it’s day time.

<span>I installed several v3's  7 months ago. They worked well. However, Wyze was constantly requiring me to install endless updates. It seemed like every week or two. Well, the last update bricked all of my camera's.<br/><br/>Power cycling did nothing. So I took a couple of the camera's down and reset them. All of them went back on line without a problem. However, as soon as I unplugged them to reinstall them, guess what! Dead again. I reset them again--three times same result. Each time they were power cycled they went into the install mode and wouldn't come out of it so they could reconnect.<br/><br/>I called Wyze tech support and they made me repeat all the steps I had already done multiple times. Why? Because the support person doesn't know much about the cameras. They're simply reading from a help desk script, and they have to check off the boxes, or they get in trouble.<br/><br/>They tried to convince me it was my fault. The network router wasn't good enough. Too many things were connected to it. On and on. I'm an engineer so I know BS when I hear it. All the cameras worked fine including the previous updates until this last one. Then bricked. That's not a coincidence, and they know it. They've had the brick problem happen numerous times, so tech support has heard it all before. Any little info packet problem, minor power spiking, wifi signal wavering or any other type of interference can cause the flash update to go wrong. All of these things are normal and should be expected with any wifi connected equipment.<br/><br/>Wyze finally agreed to replace all of the cameras, but it took about three hours going in circles with them. I've already spent close to six hours taking cameras down, testing them, talking to tech support twice, and now I've got to reinstall all the cameras again. These are good, inexpensive cameras--when they work. Tech support is available, but watch out because every problem is caused by something on your end. They really love to blame the router.<br/><br/>Bottom line--they just don't want to replace the cameras if they can convince you everything is your fault. This time they did replace them, which I appreciate. They asked me to return the failed cameras, which I don't mind, but it's just more of my time. Of course, their engineers want to look at them. Really! They'll be sitting in a box somewhere with the other few thousand failures. They'll get to mine around 2026 when someone throws them in the trash bin. They want the cameras back to insure I'm not trying to get over on them, and get free cameras.<br/><br/>When the time I've spent is taken into consideration, these cameras aren't very cost effective. My time isn't free, even though Wyze acts like it is. We'll see how long the new ones last. If their "technical team" keeps updating every few weeks like they're doing now, they'll brick some more cameras. It's the risk of e-prom updates. I would skip the updates, but they pop up a nag screen every time I open a camera. It's annoying. Clicking "don't show again" is just another waste of time. Customers aren't sitting around waiting for every minor change in the software. One or two updates a year would be adequate. Let me decide if I want the updates. Oh, that won't work because some of the updates are about taking away stuff like the 12 second videos that originally came with the cameras. What a crock!<br/><br/>It takes at least an hour to set up a half dozen cameras. Each camera has to be updated from 1 to 4 times during the setup process, depending on when it was manufactured. That takes a lot of time. Then it will take me another hour plus to reinstall them. In total, this brick update will cost me 9 to 10 hours of my time, at least.<br/><br/>Wyze has better tech support than most security camera companies. It's just slow having to go through the help screen over and over no matter how many times something has already been done.  One tech support person was willing to sit on hold while I uninstalled one camera from the roof. Ok, let me whip out the ladder, climb on the roof and do that for you. I guess they wanted their lunch break.<br/><br/> At least they replaced the cameras, THEY ruined.<br/><br/>I took one of the old bricked cameras that I didn't have to send back, and I re-flashed it with a clean update. That failed also, so whatever happened during the update is permanent. That's another design flaw. There's no way to reverse an update and fix a problem. That's also a problem that should be addressed.<br/><br/>Tech Support  3 or 4 stars--depending on who happens to answer the phone.<br/>Cam V3  (when it works)  4 stars<br/>Constant Updates  1 star<br/>Camera Software  3 stars<br/>Wasting my time  1 star<br/>Wifi issues 2 stars<br/><br/>I'll use them without EVER updating them again--at least until they force an update which they do from time to time. Maybe they have a hardware problem that needs fixing! When lots of people are reporting their cameras have bricked after updates, or after a power recycle, it's not a random glitch.  When I was buying the camera's, Wyze didn't mention anywhere in their advertisements or product descriptions that I needed to have them within 10 feet of my router, or whatever they think the maximum distance should be, for them to update properly. They didn't say I had to have less than X devices connected to my wifi. Smart home devices (especially switches) show as connected even though they don't degrade the wifi signal strength except for the split second when one is activated, and the loss of signal strength is marginal.<br/><br/>The problem with their wifi strength argument is if my cameras are in a location where  they have a constant, stable wifi connection 24/7 with no problems recording video to the micro SD card, then that should be adequate wifi connectivity for an update. The previous  10 updates completed with no problems. Again, they should be asking a lot of questions about why some updates and a few random power cycling events are bricking v3 cameras. There's a solution to this problem, if they want to find it.</span>

<span>Much improved over 1st version.  Night picture is much clearer.  I use them outside under eaves, porches &amp; patios.  Last one has been there 4 plus years &amp; was still working. Temps ranging from 110 degrees to zero.  After seeing the new vision I’ve replaced all 15 cameras at both homes.  2nd home is a cabin in the mountains so I get many videos of lions, deer, raccoons, skunks &amp; birds.  Some have even captured mice.  My biggest complaint is the constant upscale pressure of their longer cloud videos.  Whenever I replace an old camera I 15 days of their free longer videos &amp; I hate them.  Do not need to see the trees blowing for 5 minutes.  Then when free trial expires you have to figure out how to get free cam lite videos which are 12 second snapshots.  Longer videos are recorded on a 32 gig micro sd card which you access in the phone app.  So if you need the longer video it’s there you just need to look at sd card from your phone &amp; it’s there.  Works great for what I need.  Many false events outside but I realize they are an inside camera.  I’ve tried their wireless outside version &amp; they’re horrible.  They eat batteries miss the wildlife &amp; other events.  They do not have any range of wifi so they are junk.  They lack the ability of seeing the sd card from phone app. so you need to retrieve card to download events.  Never have even done that cause it’s a hassle to pretrieve card.  Just been viewing the 12 second videos.  If I had to pay to use them for videos I would change them all out for different brand.  The price point for cameras &amp; 12 second videos can’t be beat.</span>

<span>I love these Wyze cams. I own three of them and use them to view outside and inside my house. The night vision lights up the night and the picture is clear. The last one I bought was working great until about a week ago. All I hear is a static scratching sound coming from the speaker on the camera and it can no longer connect. Tried reset, but no go. I guess I have to contact the manufacturer to see if it's under warranty.<br/>UPDATE! Spoke with one of their support people. We went through some troubleshooting steps and determined there was a problem with the camera. It was still under warranty. I have a new camera the next day! Great support!</span>

<span>Ordered one from Amazon, $35. Like that camera can sit inside on window sill, flush to the glass of the window, and perfect video picture, night vision is spectacular (have read some ambient light outside is required). No need to worry about batteries or wiring, it plugs into the wall. You also do not need a subscription for just basic usage, but it will only film an event and notify you once every 5 minutes if you opt for no subscription. For $15/year, it is unlimited with no 5 minute pause between even detections. Has a micro SD slot (micro SD card not included), we just used one we had, but not necessary for camera operation. It can also be paired with other appliances through an IFTT app like a garage door.<br/>The MAJOR ISSUE is that even though you may set your detection area, the detection is via a change in pixels (where Ring, Blink, etc. are infrared and detect a heat source) and we receive an EXCESSIVE DETECTION NOTIFICATIONS when the sun sets and shines through the leaves or at night when car headlights flash across the detection area. We have also read where people receive excessive detection notifications when it rains or bugs attracted to light, but we have not had an opportunity to put it to the test with these. The only solution to minimize these notifications for these non-events is to move the camera or to set up rules to silence events during certain times of the day. For the cost, we decided we can live with this. Our walk around for now, is to just have one family member's phone receive alerts. And the other family members must block the alerts for this specific app in the settings of their phone (not within the app, or it blocks everyone's notifications).<br/>Only the initial person who sets up the camera on the app, can make a lot of the changes to the camera within the app. And other family members are just shared access to the camera and can set up their own rules. The initial person who did the set up will receive notifications a split second before the people it is shared with.<br/>Ordered a 2nd one that was supposed to be new, but WAS OPENED and still had the UPS stickers on it with the customer's name and address who had returned it. So returning the 2nd camera and ordering a replacement, hopefully this one will be new.<br/>Realize with any electronics that receive updates (like with cell phones, fitness trackers, etc), they do not have an infinite life due to technology restrictions so another reason to go for this budget friendly option. I believe Wyze retired support for their 1st model after 5 years.<br/>Price on Wyze website was $29.99 ($57.98 for 2) plus $5.99 shipping, but decided buying it from amazon would make sure we had free returns with Prime. Wyze is a company started by former Amazon employees and it is based in Seattle.<br/>Update: very sensitive to raindrops on the window, birds, neighbors' lights turning on and creates an event and notification.</span>
