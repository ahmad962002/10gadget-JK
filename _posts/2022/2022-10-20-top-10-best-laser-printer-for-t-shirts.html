<span>This purchase came after a LONG consideration of what to do if and when my old Ricoh W2400 decided to stop working (ran on Windows NT and had an XP laptop as the print server). As time marches on it finally stopped working and the scrap man showed up to collect it. This plotter does not have a scan function but for printing my architectural drawings and doing so without resorting to putting another mortgage payment on, this HP does the job with little fuss. The bonus is that I can now print in color, which is something my Ricoh could never do. Good value and pretty easy to set up and get running.  The compact set up is opening up a lot of room in my print area as well!</span>

<span>The printer arrived as promised with ink cartridges and various power cords for use in multiple countries. The set up instructions are extremely vague and I accidentally made a mistake and it cost me a whole roll of paper. Whatever I did caused the machine to spoil continuously until the 150' spool was gone. The print quality is great. I am still fighting with issues when using the app to transfer blue prints from my email on my phone and size them to fit the page. I am sure once the learning curve is over the printer will be an excellent value.</span>

<span>This is an amazing printer. Like most HP products, the print quality is flawless. I've ALWAYS hated the way HP screws their customers over for toner and ink, not to mention the inflated price of the printer itself, but I still use HP exclusively because of their quality of work. This is my first wide-fornat printer, and so far it's been a great experience. As with most printers, this one came with "starter" ink cartridges, which have actually lasted longer than I expected. I've printed 15 24"x12" signs, and i still have plenty of ink. Set up with the computer (laptop) took about 5 minutes---worked the first time. Very intuitive. It's paper handling (loading the paper, knowing exactly where to cut the paper, not wasting paper) was perfect. The self cutting, motorized blade works every time. My only issue so far is the paper rolls. Finding a 24" wide roll of bright orange paper, with the correct diameter and plugs at each end has been a headache. You cannot simply place a roll of paper on the loader and print. The rolls MUST connect to the motorized feeders (it has to be able to pull/adjust/feed the paper as it sees necessary...it automatically adjusts the skew of the paper, making sure the print is perfectly squared). I suggest for other users/purchasers of this printer, if you find a roll of paper with the right plugs in the ends, keep the plugs when it's done....they are like gold. I've actually sacrificed the last 20 feet of one roll that fits, and I manually roll new paper onto that roll. I'm sure there's a supplier with the right paper and end caps, I just haven't found them.<br/>Printer is pretty heavy. Should be installed in one location permanently. The additional HP Paper Feeder (pics attached, for regular paper, 8.5x11, etc) installs and uninstalls with ease. Very convenient. Allows you to use the printer for basically any size from 24" wide down to 8.5" wide. Printer is also wireless (have not tried yet). So far, happy with the purchase. Cannot comment on support (I did purchase HPs extended service contract---for something like this, it's a no-brainer for me).</span>

So I would say that I am going to be really happy with the print cartridge to paper ratio.<br/><br/>My experience with HP customer service was not great setting it up as I had a really odd exhibit that I just could not get rotated and had to cut the excess paper off by hand. That was truly frustrating but so far it is the only file / exhibit that has had that issue.<br/><br/>I also purchased the multi feeder for single sheets. A really great option if you need it. When I meet clients on site I share the 11 x 17 which are not to scale but provide a "picture" for them to understand the site.<br/><br/>In addition to the multi sheet feeder I also purchased the stand which is great if you need a place to put your plotter on but the sheet catcher is really BAD. It is basically a piece of fabric with a bar that catches what is printed but it does not collate the pages. So you are left with rolled up sheets that you have to collate by hand. So the stand is great but the sheet catcher needs more work in my opinion.<br/><br/>The touch screen is very small but amazingly dynamic. I would be very surprised if this is not a product enhancement in future models. It actually plays videos of tasks right on the screen so you can make sure you are reloading the rolled paper for example corretly.<br/><br/>Finally, anything that requires large numbers of copies or exact scalability I still send to my printer. My choice but I think if you are submitting plans to a Municipality this should be part of your consideration.<br/><br/>I have not plotted anything in color on glossy paper to see what a "poster" would look like but my guess is that it would be really great as the color 11 x17 at the lowest print quality are far better than any HP desket that I have ever owned.</span>

<span>Shame on me for not doing detailed research before purchase.  The 3820 ADF doesn't allow automatic 2 sided to 2 sided copy, something I do frequently.  Worse, it seems that the Epson 3820 won't even allow the ADF to be used for manual 1-2 or 2-2 sided copying. Rather, I discovered, for 1-2 or 2-2 sided input copying, documents must be placed on the scanner glass, one side at a time, following display prompt.  It's an awkward but effective work around, and surprising since the Epson 3620 I replaced did 2 sided auto ADF, and, as I recall 1 - 2 sided manual using the ADF with a prompting scheme.  That said, the printer does a credible job printing text, is fairly quiet, set up was straight forward and worked as expected. One other thing that should be pointed out, I don't think the 3820 is intended for printing photographs.</span>

<span>This is my fifth Epson printer.  I’ve had two at my office and two at home over the past 8 years or so.  One was a real workhorse  - a small Workforce 2540 - and did thousands of pages of printing until a few weeks ago when its paper feed tray broke.  The amount of work it did was well above what one would expect of a home or light-office printer and I would have given it five stars.  But the paper feeds on the other three Epsons (two of them also Workforce 2540s) broke within one year, rendering them useless.  The paper feeds are lightweight plastic, shoddily made, and it seems perhaps poorly engineered.<br/>However, because one of the four printers worked well for a long time, I did buy another Epson a few weeks ago. That one was inoperable from the first – again the paper feed which on this one crumpled pages and marked them lavishly with ink stains.  I returned that printer (no problem getting a refund, so I appreciated that) and purchased the current Workforce Pro 3820.  It is fine as a printer – good print quality, I like that it does border-to-border printing (great for brochures), fairly fast . The scanner is easy to use, fast, and makes crisp copies.  But like the other Epsons I’ve had, it is a monster with regard to the paper feed.  Although it advertises double-side printing and automatic feed of documents to be copied, it doesn’t seem to like to do anything except 8 ½ x 11 plain paper. Even that can be difficult.  It can take a dozen tries to get the paper cassette to seat and feed properly. I tried to do a batch of envelopes tonight for a 100-piece mailing (no, I did not try to fit 100 envelopes into the cassette) and it took 30 tries before I could get the cassette seated.<br/>A friend was having printing problems last week and knew that I had just bought a new printer.  She asked if I would recommend the Epson.  I told her a resounding no.  At this point, my new printer is about one hour away from being thrown out of my third story window.<br/>Do I sound frustrated?  Yes, indeed.  It’s a good printer.  But the point is to get hard copies.  All four of the ones I have in “dead storage” are still capable of printing, but not able to print because of paper feed issues.<br/>Another issue:  I haven’t found any indication in the printer manual that it is feasible to feed a single sheet or envelope.  One has to load the cassette with plain paper, or letterhead, or envelopes. For a simple letter, one would have to replace the paper cassette and reload it with envelopes.  And remember that it can take 30 tries to seat the #%%^^#  cassette.  I have a business.  One writes a letter on letterhead, wants a plain paper copy, and needs an envelope in which to mail it.  Am I supposed to change the cassette three times to accomplish this and struggle with it each time?</span>

I am surprised how well it works for printing and scanning from multiple computers. I have not tried the print feature from the iphone yet. I am not tech savy so this is why I am so impressed.</span>

<span>My ancient MFC-7420 finally died.  One absolute requirement for a replacement was duplex scanning, because, who wants to keep paper anymore?  This MFC-L2750DW does that, and duplex print as well.  All good.<br/><br/>So far, I have not been able to achieve the scan quality that I could with my old machine.  It's fine for document record keeping, but for something with small print (medical insurance cards) that you need to share with someone (doctors), the scan is somewhat difficult to read.  I've played with the DPI setting without much improvement.  It made the file size bigger but not much clearer.  Maybe I just need play with it more.<br/><br/>Per the user guide, Brother provides two different software control panels, ControlCenter4 and iPrint&amp;Scan.  The first for Windows and the latter for Macs.  I have a Windows machine.  When I downloaded the driver it installed iPrint.  I cannot get CC4 to install.  It starts then errors out because some file or other is "in use" (as I recall).  That's confusing but seems to have no impact because the iPrint panel works even though I'm on Windows.<br/><br/>Previously I always used the Windows Fax and Scan app to control my printer.  It has a preview and crop functions.  If that exists in iPrint I haven't found it, so any cropping has to happen after the fact.  No biggie.  On the upside, iPrint allows you to scan multiple pages to a single file.  WF&amp;S does not, or at least does not support it with this model.  Also, iPrint allows you scan in pdf format and direct your scan to a particular folder.  That saves a couple of steps.  With WF&amp;S there is no pdf format and all scans go to a default folder.  You then have to "print to pdf" and then direct to the folder of your choosing.<br/><br/>The toner cartridge is microchipped (I'm guessing they all are anymore), so if you're planning on re-filling your cartridges you have to contend with that.  Since I rarely print, toner cost is not an issue for me.  The starter cartridge should outlive me.<br/><br/>All in all, I'm happy with the purchase.  It does what I need it to do.  If I can figure out how to improve the small-print scan quality I'll probably raise the review to 5 stars.</span>

<span>This computer will not serve the needs of the average home office or student's needs. It does not make copies or do faxing. It is mainly designed for the professional photographer. It does not have a separate paper tray for photo paper. It requires adjustments of the one paper tray. There is a back paper feed that can manage heavier and larger paper formats. It prints CDs with a separate tray.<br/><br/>It requires 6 ink cartridges; the 4 standard-magenta, cyan, yellow, black- and grey and red, for more definitive picture coloring. I found the cost of the ink a little cheaper than my last printer.<br/><br/>A lot of the required interaction on the control panel, such as retracting the paper output tray, could be handled with a dialog box on the computer or make it automatic. Instead, you have to go to the printer and push buttons. Setting up print jobs, such as printing an envelope is not, initially, an intuitive process. You will need to reference the user manual to set that up because of the menus on the printer's control panel. The menus aren't clear, at least for me. I always have to reference the user manual to get through them. I imagine after a few times through the menus I'll become accustomed to them. This would be an easier process if this could be completely set up in the print dialog box.<br/><br/>Photos come out beautiful.<br/><br/>The printer allows paper as wide as 13 inches and longer than 17 inches (not sure of length limits). I chose this printer so I could print on watercolor paper. It will accept heavier paper like cardstock where other printers can't handle that weight. Crafters would like that.<br/><br/>I do not have my printer next to my computer since I share it with the household so I am constantly having to get up and down to interact with the control panel to make selections and to close the paper tray after printing. This is an inconvenience for me since I am disabled. If more of the control panel's interactions could be put into the print dialogue boxes on the computer that would be a great improvement. Adding at least a copy feature would be very helpful, too, since it is the most common and often necessary feature used besides printing pages with a printer.<br/><br/>Honestly, I regret buying this printer. But that was my fault because I didn't research it's functionality thoroughly enough. I need a printer that does copying. I would have preferred a printer that communicates more through a dialog box.<br/><br/>Actually, this is a replacement for one I had for only a month. The first one's paper output tray broke. It wouldn't retract. It looked like it came off its track. I tried to reseat it but it wouldn't budge. Epson replaced it, no questions asked.</span>

<span>Excuse the long review.  When my old Epson died in the middle of a print job, I was so excited to be able to purchase this model printer.  It was the last one available.  The dealer got it to me quickly; no problems with shipping.  However, the printer itself proved to be a big problem.  According to the reviews, people love or hate this printer.  I myself was totally exasperated before asking for a refund.  Why?  First, the power button is hard to see.  When going through the installation process, my first hiccup was that I  could not see the power button.  I kept hitting the home button instead.  Realizing that the home button did not have the proper icon, I got out a flashlight and hunted around until I found the power button.  {Yes, I wear glasses but they correct to 20/20].  A small irritation, really, and easily corrected once I found the right button. The rest of the loading process went smoothly.  Ink cartridges were easy to install.  Synching with computer was a breeze.  Test pages on plain paper and fine-tuning print nozzles took time but were easy.  The test page on plain paper looked sharp.  However, printing on photo quality paper was a disaster.  First, pages hung up in the printer. I kept getting an error message saying to reload paper when the paper was properly in the tray.  Had to keep opening and closing the tray. Double checked to see that the type of paper was properly entered.  Check.  Paper installed correctly.  Check.  Print quality on computer and printer synced.  Checked.  Right side paper up.  The problem?  When printing on photo paper--high gloss, matt presentation quality, and semi-gloss, I kept getting smeared looks--the results reminded me of watercolors.  Tried printing on top of the line Ilford paper--worse.  After more than four hours of checking, retesting, recleaning, redoing, gave up.  [Incidentally, I have used Epson printers for years.  Never had this sort of problem.]  Finally gave up and called Amazon.<br/><br/>Amazon to the rescue!  They did have to connect me with Epson to see if Epson could help me solve the problem.  That call was a disaster. Summary:  Did you try this?  yes, 2x.  Did you try this?  yes, 2x.  You must be loading paper wrong.  No, I have tripled checked....After over an hour of repeating the basic steps over and over,  my hero Amazon person stepped in, ending the call, and allowed me to return the machine.  Repacked and had machine picked up.  Hurrah.<br/><br/>Looking back, since I had problems with the paper not loading as it should, perhaps it is some sort of roller problem.  Don't know.<br/><br/>Several folks have spoken highly of this printer.  I did much research before ordering it and it was generally highly praised.  The test shots on plain paper which I printed as part of the loading process have fine detail and great color gamuts.  I think I just got a lemon.  However, with Amazon, the pain of the lemon is now gone.<br/><br/>So...I have to give this individual printer a one because while it prints great on plain paper, it is useless for printing quality pictures on photo grade paper.  I give tech support [EPSON] a two because the person I spoke of did not seem to know much except how to start the printer going.  I give AMAZON support a 5!!!They were my hero in this situation and did not jack up the price because of scarcity.  I also give the seller a 5 for they got the printer to me quickly in great shape.  I give the printer a one for "touch screen" because it didn't have one.  It had buttons to push instead.  Not a big problem but would take longer to set settings than a touch screen would.<br/><br/>If these printers were widely available, I probably would reorder and try another, but as of 9/1/20, decent printers and photo printers are not available as a result of the Covid-19 outbreak.</span>

<span>I had researched for a new color printer. This included the ability to print larger format, Color &amp; B&amp;W to a very good standard. So far Ive set it up, relatively simple with the Phone App. Printed a couple of images and am very impressed. It replaces a previous Epson R380 photographic printer.

<span>I have been using a Canon pro 9000 for years and while I did have to replace the head a while back (couldn't clear a clog), I have always been pleased with the results.  But lately, I grew tired of paying so much for the ink.  Tired too that replacing a single ink tank seemed to run down the others a bit when it primed the replacement -- though maybe that was just my imagination.  Anyway, I have used a few Epson ET printers over the last few years (starting with an ET-2650) and even though I was unhappy with one of their earlier 'photo' ET's (an ET-7700 that tended to leave ink smudges on the leading or trailing edge of prints -- an issue I have since seen others report on the web), I decided to give the ET-8550 a try.<br/><br/>So far, so good.  A few dozen 13x19's and not a hitch.<br/><br/>One thing to consider though -- and it may not be an issue, as I haven't tried it.  If you print on heavy stock and want to (or have to) keep the stock 'flat', you have to do it from the rear of the printer.  AND, you have to remove the duplexer and re-configure the rear feed in a way that was not obvious from the manual.  On the Canon, heavy stock was trivial to print.  You didn't even have to actually feed it from the rear -- you just lowered the deck, extended the supports on the rear, inserted the paper from the front and the printer took care of the rest.  So I'll probably keep the Canon just for heavy stock...</span>

<span>I've had this printer since the end of September.  It seems like a quality job to me.  Was easy to set up though it took a bit of time.  Directions were good.  The photos as good as any I've seen.  I've checked online and with others; yes the ink really is about $90.00 for ALL SIX of the colors.  I may not have really needed the 8550 (prints 13" X 19" paper) but I think the extra size will come in handy.<br/><br/>I have no complaints about the printer.  Just be careful which you look at.  The 8500 printer is a small brother to the 8550.  8550 prints on 13" X 19" paper; the 8500 does not and is smaller than the 8550.<br/><br/>One thing, I think the dimensions on the amazon site are incorrect.  I was nervous that the printer (8550) would not fit on. my printer stand given the listed size.  However while it is wider, it is NOT deeper as the listed size says.</span>

<span>Bought this to replace an old Epson printer. Light weight. Small footprint. Installation through the HP Smart app was acceptable. Had to contact HP support for assistance.  There is very little documentation included with the unit.  Both color and black and white copy quality is good.  Wireless works very well once it is set up.  Scan quality is good with multiple options.  The scanner option is single page feed, but additional pages can be added through the app.  Both document and photo printed quality is good.  Print speed, however, is slower than it should be.  This unit is best for light personal use.  Would not recommend this unit for business use or heavy personal use. 1st set of inkjet cartridges through Instant Ink program arrived promptly.  Cost of the program and multiple options is a cost saver. This unit will serve my purposes very well. LCD panel informative and well designed.</span>

<span>I love the small size and the clean, crisp printing.  However, setting up the wifi was a very difficult and involved many steps (unlike other wifi printers I have purchased).  Although I am a tech savvy average computer, printer user, it took me too much time and too many steps to figure out how to set up the wifi.  The instructions in the box and online were limited and not very helpful.</span>

<span>This printer comes with VERY FEW printed instruction sheets, which one would assume means it is simple to setup. Unbox, plug in, insert ink cartridges, connect via USB, WiFi direct or add to your WiFi network and voila!<br/><br/>Except when I plugged it in and opened the front panel to install the ink cartridges, I could hear/see the cartridge carrier shake and vibrate but it would not move to the open area to allow installation. I looked inside for one of those large red/orange tabs that sometimes secures movable components, but none were visible. I checked the instructions AGAIN - nothing. I viewed the setup/get started videos on the HP website, no mention of anything to remove.<br/><br/>Error code 3E on the panel which means 'carriage malfunction' (no surprise). Instructions on how to clear the error were about removing paper jams. Have yet to print anything, so no paper has been through it. After 30 minutes of back and forth I am ready to box it up and return it and as I turn it over, I hear a 'rattle'....hmmm.  I shake a bit, more rattle. I look inside and shake and waaay in the back, I see a small white plastic piece. I cannot reach it with my hand, so I continue to turn and shake until this piece falls out (see picture).<br/><br/>Plug it back in and the carriage centers as it should and I can proceed with installation.<br/><br/>While the installable HP printer app is well designed and easy to use, and there are numerous pages of instructions you can print by pressing buttons on the printer, HP should include just a little more information - especially about the carriage lock AND use one that is a more visible color.<br/><br/>Another potential problem is if you sign up for 'Instant Ink' - the ink delivery service.<br/>This service requires connectivity from the printer to HP using a webservice. Unfortunately, this feature was disabled by default (at least on this printer). When I tried to register I kept getting a rather innocuous error. After a bit of frustration and way too much time, I found reference to how to enable it, but using a browser to connect to the printer directly. Cool - except I was prompted for a password, which wasn't provided anywhere. None of the 'usual defaults' worked, nothing listed on the HP site/web search worked but I found mention of how to reset it to not need a password, which I did. This also reset the WiFi settings on the printer - phhht.  Fortunately, the HP software made setting that up, AGAIN straight forward, but I mean - COME ON!<br/><br/>All total, I spent approx 2hrs of frustration getting this tiny box setup when it should have been &lt;30 minutes.<br/><br/>As a result of these experiences, I rated this printer 1 for tech support due to setup issues and 3 overall.<br/><br/>For those not familiar with WiFi Direct, be aware that when you are connected to the printer you are NOT connected to your internet connection. I've had more than a few friends get frustrated by that.  I recommend you avoid it unless you have used it before. It's benefits in your average home environment is, IMO- limited.</span>

<span>I ordered one of these for my Mom and it is excellent. It was easy enough to set up despite her OS, (I don't do Windows). The print is crisp and clear and it can print on both sides of the paper. I decided to get one for my hubby, too, since like Mom, he doesn't print often enough to prevent inkjets from clogging. The laser printer is a good solution.<br/><br/>Unfortunately things didn't go as well with the second printer. We all came down with COVID so I didn't get it set up right away. When I finally got well and motivated, I set it up for him and the printouts had a dark thick strip of ink along the left side. After trying every trick in the book. I realized that the cartridge was damaged. It was supposed to be good for I think 7000 printouts. I contacted Brother and they said because it was past the time to return the product, they were done with me. I didn't want a return. I was hoping for at least a discount on a new cartridge. but apparently fairness and customer satisfaction isn't in their policy. While I like the printer, I have great reservation about the company.</span>

<span>The reviews and Q &amp; A's are conflicting as to whether this printer is compatible with computers running Linux. The truth is: yes, it is. But not in a way many people are used to. I struggled with this too. There are no native device drivers for this printer, for Linux. But like most popular modern printers, you can print from your phone on this printer, which means it supports Internet Printing Protocol (IPP). IPP and AirPrint are protocols understood by the Common Unix Printing System (CUPS). So it will work but it may require some extra setup on your part. Especially if you are trying to set it up while not connected via USB. I have not tested the printer over USB, but I suggest you do that first if possible before taking any of my advice. Your Linux distribution might be able to detect and setup the printer automatically over USB. If not, or if you need to set-up over WiFi, here is the process I followed on Manjaro, specifics on your distro might be different.<br/><br/>1. If you have already been messing around with many settings. Use the printer's display and buttons to find the reset function to reset everything on the printer to factory defaults. It's under: initial setup &gt; reset &gt; machine reset.<br/>2. Start up the printer and connect it to your WiFi by following the included instructions.<br/>3. Access your router's admin portal, find the IP address of the printer and write it down. You should make it static as well. Otherwise the printer's local IP address might change in the future.<br/>4. Now enter the printer's IP into your browser, which will bring up a remote management portal.<br/>5. At the top, there is a login button with a text input box. Enter the password found on the sticker on the back of your printer and login.<br/>6. Go to the network tab.<br/>7. click "protocol" on the left-hand menu.<br/>8. Make sure "IPP" is checked.<br/>9. CUPS is probably already installed on your system. But just to be sure use your package manager to make sure you have CUPS installed, as well as the web interface. On Manjaoro, the package called "manjaro-printer" will download all the necessary stuff. I believe it is installed by default. Either way, you're looking for a package called CUPS, manage printing, CUPS web interface, or something similar.<br/>10. Now that CUPS is installed enter this URL in your web browser: http://localhost:631<br/>11. If you installed the right package, this should take you to a web page where you manage CUPS. At the top of the page, click "administration"<br/>12. Click "add printer".<br/>13. In the list on the next page, select "internet printing protocol (IPP)" and continue.<br/>14. For connection, enter "ipp://&lt;printer-ip-address&gt;:631" and continue. Replace "&lt;printer-ip-address&gt;" with an actual IP address...<br/>15. Add a name, description and location for the printer and continue. This information isn't critical. It will show up in print dialog boxes.<br/>16. Select "Brother" from the list of makes and continue.<br/>17. For model select "IPP Everywhere" (lol) and click "add printer".<br/>18. The next page has something to do with "banners". I have no idea what it is, doesn't seem important. Click "set default options".<br/><br/>That's it, the printer should be ready to use now. To print a test page:<br/><br/>1. Click "printers" in the menu at the top of the page.<br/>2. Click on the Brother printer you just finished setting up<br/>3. In the "maintenance" drop-down menu, select "print test page".<br/><br/>If everything worked out, you should see a new print job appear at the bottom of the screen and a few moments later the printer should whirr to life and spit out the test page. I hope this helped!</span>

<span>The printer is quiet and is solidly built.  It prints reasonably fast and well enough for a low-cost option. However, during the setup process the software refuses to 'Select Machine' which allows my laptop to install drivers and use the machine. I have tried all the recommended methods to install wireless including using a USB cable to complete the process.  The printer simply refuse to be 'found' to allow the installation to continue.  Wireless functionality is important to my needs.  It is unclear if the problem is just this specific machine or if the entire line is difficult to install.  I am considering ordering another and returning this one.  Do not buy this model if you have an urgent need for wireless printing.<br/><br/>Update: I was eventually able to complete the Wireless installation.  After a few more attempts, I became frustrated and went into my Router setup using the IP Address access.  I reviewed various settings, turned on and off a security item here and there, and then logged out in frustration.  On a whim, I ran the Brother Wireless setup again after the IP Address was closed....and to my amazement the software was able to find the new printer and completed the install.  So, if you are frustrated in your attempt to set up wireless, access your router via IP Address and change and then change back a security setting or two, and then exit. Then try the Brother Wireless setup again.  Good Luck!</span>

<span>First, I have purchased 3 of these printers:<br/>- One for child in college.<br/>- One for my home office (use it for PCs, Macs, iPhones, iPads)<br/>- One for some elderly relatives who had to futz with their old inkjet printer each time they used it (they're printing from PCs and iPhones).<br/><br/>We all love them. And let’s face it … 95% of what we print doesn't need to be in color. This printer is fast, prints duplex with ease and the ink cartridges last a long time and it doesn't get gummed up like ink jets do after a period of non-use.  It has saved us $$$ by not needing to purchase as many ink cartridges.<br/><br/>I’m only giving 4 stars since in the beginning I had issues with iOS devices not finding the printer. I’m not intimidated by any technology as I've been around it a long time - but this took a lot of digging to figure out. Now that I’ve finally got the iOS issue resolved these printers are perfect for our needs.<br/><br/>This is what I’ve done to make these printers work well with iOS devices:<br/>- First - Do Not use the WPS connection mode. Use a Printer USB cable connected to a computer to set up the wifi on this printer. Make sure you find your SSID and enter your wifi password.<br/>- Turn off Deep Sleep Mode (see the review by Winnie NG for instructions or other instructions for this printer)<br/>- Extend the sleep time (mine is at 50 minutes)<br/>- Set Auto Off at 1hr (not sure if this is needed but I suggest it anyway, it will not power off since it will be asleep before the hour comes up)<br/>- Once all this is done … power-down the machine and restart it.<br/><br/>The second reason I'm not giving it 5 stars is that despite changing the printer's drum and following every set of instructions provided by Brother and others, the beast still says "The optical photoconductor needs to be replaced."  According to Brother a new drum replaces the optical photoconductor, therefore the photoconductor does not need replacing a second time and all Brother's instructions to turn off this incorrect error message fail.<br/><br/>****** Update *******<br/>I found that the printer sometimes goes away and is not discoverable by my Apple devices and the printer must be rebooted.  However there seems to be a fix for this as well. If you enable IPv6 Protocol on the printer it is always visible to my Apple devices.<br/><br/>Warning this is not for the faint of heart, but should be is easy enough for the average user.<br/><br/>Step 1)<br/>First you must find your printer's network IP Address. Do this by printing out the Printer's Network Configuration.<br/>On the Printer:<br/>Push the Up Key (+) until you see Machine Info. Displayed and Press OK<br/>Push the Up Key (+) until you see Print NetSettings and Press OK<br/>A Network Configuration Page will print. On this print out you will find the printer's IP Address. It should be something like this 10.0.0.XXX<br/><br/>Step 2)<br/>Open a Browser on your computer and input this URL: http://&lt;printer_IP_Address&gt;<br/>This will open up the web configuration interface<br/><br/>Follow this navigation to enable IPv6:<br/>Network Tab &gt; Protocol<br/>Click on the Advanced Settings link for AirPrint<br/>Click on IPv6 (Wireless)&gt;&gt;<br/>Select IPv6 as Enabled and make the selection to Enable this Address (no need to fill anything out) and click on the Submit button<br/><br/>The printer always shows up as an available device in all our Apple devices.<br/><br/>See https://www.amazon.com/Brother-Monochrome-HL-L2350DW-Two-Sided-Replenishment/product-reviews/B0763WDSYZ  for Winnie NG's instructions about sleep mode</span>
