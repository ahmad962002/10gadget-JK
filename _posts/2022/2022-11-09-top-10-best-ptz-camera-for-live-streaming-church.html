<span>We've really enjoyed our new Honey Optics camera.<br/>The video is much more crisp than our Mevo cameras we had been using, and being able to remotely control the camera and designate "zoom spots" has been super helpful.<br/>Set-up takes a little work unless you know about networks &amp; IP Addresses, but it's worth it.</span>

<span>This is a great 4K Camera, we have been using for a few months to stream church services and it's worked like a dream. NDI with POE is fantastic. Compatible with PTZOptics controller software, and NDI webcam input so we easily use with Zoom, OBS, or livestream and control PTZ functionality with a mobile device on the network. Awesome functionality, compatibility, and components at a great price, thanks Honey Optics!</span>

<span>We are satisfied with the quality of picture this camera puts out. If you plan to live stream, though, be aware that its audio input/throughput to HDMI is very poor. Even their own customer service reps admit this and recommend you have a separate audio input on your streaming device. The remote is infrared, not radio signal controlled, so you must point it at the front of the camera for it to work. Our camera is being used in the balcony of a church with the remote in the balcony, so the camera had to be mounted sideways and the remote user has to stand on that side for it to work. It is possible to clip a small mirror to reflect the infrared signal, if you're willing to patiently work at it.</span>

<span>This is the only camera in our church streaming system. It is installed 48 feet away from the stage. It works well in average to bright light, but not as good on a darkened room. Zooming is excellent. We would get another one if a second camera is needed. It was installed with the recommended wall bracket and there were no issues in the installation. This camera was selected mainly for the PTZ abilities and its three video connections. The HDMI connection made an easy conection to a ATEM Mini Pro. The serial connection was not used, and the Ethernet connection may be used in the future. Good stuff!</span>

<span>We purchased these for our church's live stream broadcast due to COVID-19.  the camera does great --  super easy to use, fantastic quality, and quick setup.  Have already ordered another to replace the existing camera (because this one is so much better!).<br/><br/>August 2020 update -- we purchased a total of 3 of these cameras for our sanctuary!  No complaints -- they work great.  We ended up replacing two so we could have POE.  Still highly recommend these cameras!!  Awesome results at a really good price!</span>

<span>We use this camera for our church services. It works really well. The only drawback is that to use the remove, you have to be totally behind the camera to "hit" it. If you point the remote at the camera it will not interact, you have to have a physical line of sight with the infrared window on the back.</span>

<span>One of the major reasons I want to change my camera was that my room is relatively dark , and because of that the picture of the webcam in my older logitech webcam was not good. I am really surprised at the brightness of the the lights on this camera, it really lights up the area around my face. This is exactly what I was hoping for.<br/><br/>Also the picture quality is really good with 1080p which is more than enough in a conference call.<br/><br/>It was plug and play in my setup of MAC with multiple monitors, and I didn't have to install any drivers for this,.<br/><br/>I was having a hard time finding good cameras which can be shipped fast to me due to the COVID19 situation , the shipping speed on this was really fast and got the camera within 2 days. So took a chance on a new camera.<br/><br/>Would definitely recommend this camera to anyone looking for value for money features.</span>

<span>We are very pleased with this camera for our Church's Online presence. The 30x zoom is more than what we need for inside the sanctuary, but we stream other events outdoors like our beach baptisms and on Easter Sunday at the local High School Stadium where I'm sure we will be able to take advantage of the 30x zoom. Good clean video picture, love the preset capabilities, push button framing works great for our video director. Easier to train than a volunteer camera person...<br/><br/>  Having PTZ capabilities means we can place the cameras without having to accommodate a camera person to operate. This is a game changer for sure, looking forward to getting a couple more (20x should be sufficient for the other camera locations).</span>

<span>We have been using robotic cameras for our church streaming for several years, but have been desiring to upgrade to higher quality and functionality that has seemed to be beyond our budget. Discovery of these POE cameras (we have bought 2 so far) has enabled this for us as we are still finding the extent to which they are able to elevate our productions with features so much better than we knew were possible. The network control through the ip addresses and the ptz capablities through an ip controller have opened up potential for much greater looking shots.  This is all at a price that is a fraction of comparable cameras that we had been looking at. We are so grateful for the opportunity to acquire and utilize these cameras and are looking to get more.</span>

<h2 style="text-align: center;">FAQS</h2>
<h3><h3>Which is the best camera for church live streaming?</h3></h3>
    

A camera with a zoom lens is ideal for church live streaming, as it will allow you to capture shots of the entire congregation from a distance.
<h3><h3>What is the best PTZ control?</h3></h3>
    

There is no one-size-fits-all answer to this question, as the best PTZ control depends on the specific needs of the user. Some factors to consider when choosing a PTZ control include ease of use, functionality, and compatibility with other systems.
<h3><h3>How much more beneficial is it to use a PTZ camera?</h3></h3>
    

PTZ cameras offer a much greater range of motion than traditional fixed cameras, making it easier to capture all of the desired footage. Additionally, they can be panned and zoomed in on specific areas to get a closer look, which can be very useful during investigations or security operations.
<h3><h3>How long do PTZ cameras last?</h3></h3>
    

There is no definitive answer to this question as it depends on the specific camera model, how it is used, and other factors. However, PTZ cameras generally have a lifespan of 3 to 5 years.
