<span>4 stars for being good at what they are for. But it seems they can run into trouble over time.<br/><br/>To borrow another reviewer, because how many ways can you say it:  "First, these are not multimedia headphones - the sound is dry and flat, different recordings are heard unequally. So they are good for studio work and not very good for consumer use.<br/>I like these for playing or playing along with music/band as they sort of feature the lows/mids and compress everything together so nothing stands out too much and everything is a little easier to hear. Making it easier to follow with everyone else.  They also do well with handling the lows and attack from an electronic kit.</span>

<span>Closed Headphone:<br/>1st: JVC HARX700: Spacious, clear. Well rounded. Maybe a bit sharp and less warm. Very comfortable.<br/>2nd: Alesis DRP100: Warmer than JVC HARX700, but less spacious. Excellent isolation. Comfortable.<br/>3rd: Beyerdynamic DT 240 PRO: Very balanced and warm. Not comfortable due to on-ear design.<br/>4th: Audio-Technica ATH-M20X: Thin sounding. Worst performer.<br/><br/>Open Headphone:<br/>1st: Philips SHP9500: Best sound quality to me. Extremely comfortable, but little loose fitting.<br/>2nd: Samson Technologies SR850: Very close runner up to the SHP9500. Very comfortable.<br/>3rd: AKG Pro Audio K240: Higher impedance, so little harder to drive. Less open sounding. Definitely a step behind the above two.</span>

<span>Sound and noise cancellation are fine. They get a little warm around your ears after wearing for a while. Build quality is not the best. The plug on the pair I purchased started coming apart. Alesis customer support was helpful and did an exchange by mail. They said that the old pair would go to their quality control team to review. Now this second pair is getting a hole in the cord.</span>

<span>SO, JUST WHAT DOES "PROFESSIONAL" MEAN? These ATH-M20X "Professional Studio Monitor Headphones" may not be suitable for a dedicated audiophile--but for field work, podcasts, etc.--these are a great buy for the money.<br/><br/>For critical listening, I love my GRADO LABS open back phones which sadly, provide NO sound isolation whatsoever. When it comes time to record in noisy environments, the ATH-M20X "Professional Studio Monitor "Headphones are more than adequate for critical listening. These are NOT Noise Cancelling cans by any means, but they provide just enough isolation to make them valuable in the studio OR in an airport, etc. These are full-range phones with impressive bass reproduction (yes, you can fit a kettle drum inside your head.) They are NOT the most focused or best sounding cans--but for under 50 bucks, they are pretty damn good. I use them for podcasting and critical music mixing. Again, for audiophile ears, you you'd probably do better with GRADO SR60's (around $65)--but when sound isolation (not noise cancelling) is a must, I found myself impressed.<br/><br/>If you are a professional recording engineer, you should be able to afford $300+ cans that are noticeably superior--but for the rest of us, these ATH-M20X  Headphones are more than adequate for "studio work."</span>

<span>I’ve had these headphones since end of December 2019, gotten for flight over the holidays. Tried out both Bose noice Cancelling headphones at local brick &amp; mortar store, but the price caused me to pause.  On to Amazon where I found these, better price, would arrive before my flight, sounded like a deal worth a shot after reading everything about them what did I have to lose with Amazon’s return policy &amp; Anker’s reputation for quality.<br/>I’ve had great chargers, other electronic items by Anker with great results.  They arrived on time well packaged, impressive from the start, but sound quality sealed the deal.<br/>Back to Anker headphones, I love them! The sound quality is amazing, when I have ANC on I can’t hear anything but music, the outside noise is indeed cancelled. Even on my really bad flight (another story) a guy wanted to test them against his B newest headphones, so we switched for a test. He said he wish he had known about Ankers quality &amp; price, they were impressive not that he would give up the B set, but would definitely buy them as a spare or an extra pair to use for other activities, he couldn’t believe the price.  He went straight to Amazon asked me if the pair he chose were the same as mine, they were &amp; he ordered them. That kind of confirmed I have a great pair of anc headphones &amp; didn’t pay $$$ for them,<br/>They pair easily and are comfortable - until I’ve worn for hours then my shades/glasses are indented in my skull, time for a break, but that’s after hours of wearing-enjoying great sounding music 4-6 hrs &amp; battery is still strong, time fly by.<br/>There are only 2 minor suggestions for Anker regarding these headphones 1) add to Soundcore app please (after thought I don’t know if it’s needed unless to customize equalizer) the volume can be controlled on the headphones.  2) the headband could use a slight redesign.  Wearing them while working out, doing lawn work or inside cleaning, cooking, always moving about  (excellent BT range btw), the top of headband pulls my hair as the headband is adjustable it tends to slide a wee bit &amp; my hair gets pulled  so I have to adjust them &amp; keep going, I’ve no idea how they could do this it’s something I noticed when trying out my son's. He bought a cheap pair of JBL headphones for lawn mowing, they do fit a little better but don’t compare to Ankers sound quality, imho Would love JBL type fit on Anker Life Q20 hybrid ANC headphones!<br/>Taking phone calls while wearing headphones works great, I asked how did I sound, fine he said, then we laughed when I told him I was listening to music on my Ankers when he called &amp; I took the call while wearing my headphones. Neither of us had any problems with quality of call. Volume is easy to find &amp; adjust the multifunction button is easy to use for music or calls.<br/>They come with the charging cable, though I wish more companies included the wall plug in,I don’t always have a spare just ling around, ok so I never have a spare just laying about.  Also the aux cable is included though I haven’t used that feature yet. A drawstring pouch to put them in, which was good as I didn’t have a case to put them in for my flight &amp; no time to get one. Instructions are well written Anker products are always first class<br/>Love these headphones, the ANC &amp; overall sound quality at this price point is a gift that keeps on giving. The quality of this model looks &amp; sounds like the much higher price headphones, maybe better than some.  I wouldn’t hesitate to buy for a gift as they come gift wrap ready or a gift of music for me.<br/>Overall Ankers entry into the headphone, earbud market is welcomed. I wouldn’t hesitate to try them out if you’re looking for headphones with ANC Fantastic sound, that doesn’t break the budget to tears, give them a listen I think you’re going to love them.<br/>Simply put my Anker Life Q20 ANC headphones are fantastic in quality and sound. I’m not an audiophile but I can’t find a thing disappointing in these, not quality or sound.  I like a variety of music &amp; I hear good  bass, mid tones &amp; treble, vocal it’s all there. As said for everything including quality these headphones deliver at a price that doesn’t break the bank &amp; with Ankers outstanding customer service is amazing. I can honestly say Anker SoundCore is definitely impressive, just as their charging cables, &amp; other electronic devices that was my first introduction to Anker products. I’m sure I’ll look at their Bluetooth speakers soon.<br/>Sorry for overly long review, there’s so many outstanding elements that I feel are important for customers to know when spending your money,I try to offer as much info I’ve experienced as possible, I’ve relied on Amazon customer reviews when making a purchase, they’re brutally honest good or bad &amp; I appreciate that.<br/>I’ve had &amp; used these headphones since late 22nd December, tonight is 25 July enough time to really evaluate  them, they’ve exceeded my expectations, I would definitely recommend, most of all I would buy them again.<br/>Thanks if you did read this long review, good intentions to help others as they shop.<br/><br/> UPDATE 12 August a friend of mine used my Ankers while visiting. He called back he had received his very own Anker Life Q 20 headphones.  That says a lot about the sound &amp; quality whilst respecting the customers wallet, he was so happy with his new headphones &amp; that I recommended Ankers.<br/><br/>Thanks again to Amazon shoppers, Amazon &amp; Anker</span>

<span>I've owned three of this model of headset now. They all die from the same exact design flaw. I'm not willing to buy another but if you learn from my mistakes you'll probably enjoy good performance for a long time.<br/>Don't wear them around your neck. That's pretty much it. As you can see from the photo, the plastic framing holding the joint just above the earpiece isn't designed to handle much stress. A lot of the time I leave my headset on the desk when not in use, and that provided a long enough lifespan for me to tell you the good parts:<br/>Call quality is great, I never have any complaints. The noise cancellation (for the wearer) is about a third as good as more expensive headsets or earbuds I've tested, which makes sense as they're about a third the price.<br/>Battery life is pretty good. I can get through a six hour conference call marathon, but it'll leave me using laptop speakers and mic by the end of the day because you can't charge during use.<br/>Comfort is better than par. Anything under 4 hours at a stretch has been no problem for me. I'm relieved to take them off after five or more hours of calls.<br/>Unfortunately I forgot, after maybe nine or ten months, what not to do with this pair. I was up from my desk, getting a coffee, and wore my headphones out of the room in case there was a question that needed my response on the call (there wasn't). When the call ended I lowered the headphones to my neck rather than place them on the kitchen counter.<br/>After grabbing my coffee, heading back to the office I gripped the headphones in one hand, grabbing the center of the headband, and pulled back to take them off my neck. This wasn't a forceful motion at all. I felt only mild pressure from the headphones against my neck, no real discomfort, but sliding them off my neck in this manner was enough to end them.<br/><br/>Like I said, this makes 3 for 3 of this model that died in the same way. The first was a similar story. I grabbed by one ear piece and tried to sort of curve it around the neck to take it off, breaking that same joint. Pair number two lasted the longest. I remembered every time to grab with both hands on the earpiece, every time I took it off my neck, but a few dozen repetitions was too much for that joint by the earpiece. They cracked and broke in the same place, pretty much the same way as you see here. This now makes a third pair of Soundcore Q20 that broke in the same manner through normal use.<br/><br/>If you're confident you'll never wear these on your neck, and you'll only ever gingerly move them on and off your head with both hands holding both earpieces, they're honestly a great performing headset for work calls, good for an audiobook while mowing the lawn or blowing leaves, and not bad for music.<br/><br/>Just don't buy these if you like to hold your headphones on your shoulders, draped around your neck, like many of us do. They can't handle the strain.</span>

<span>I'll be quite honest that I first bought these when trying to find one of the cheapest reputable noise cancelling headphones that I planned to use exclusively for mowing.  I have a 3 acre lawn and spend hours mowing each week and the regular headphones just had to be jacked up too loud to hear over the drone so I finally jumped on these.<br/><br/>These headphones have been nothing short of great for me.  I'm sure you'll find plenty of people griping about options that may be missing and no app support and yada yada yada but the truth is, these offer a large amount of bang for the buck.  Noise cancelling and great, but not perfect when comparing to Bose headphones (shocker, right?)  Ears do start to sweat a little after an hour or so but that's not extremely surprising either.  Plenty loud, especially if you turn off the noise cancelling.  Perhaps this is par for the course, but I was slightly disappointed at how much bass you lose when you turn on the noise cancelling.  They actually shocked me at how much bass they have when comparing to other headphones 4 times their price.  I wouldn't go as far as to call them boomy but they do have a good punch.<br/><br/>At the end of the day, i've liked these headphones so much that i've had to keep moving them between the garage and the house as I use them to watch movies late at night when I don't wanna wake the rest of the family up.<br/><br/>They are a great budget friendly pair of noise cancelling headphones with a great battery life.  I'd buy again!</span>

<span>Wow.  I am rarely this blown away by consumer-grade peripherals, but I feel very compelled to write a glowing review of these headphones.<br/><br/>I do a lot of audio work, and cans are ubiquitous.  I have some wired Sennies that I love behind the mixer, a couple wired Audio Technicas that have stood the test of time in the broadcast studio, and a pair of nice Sony BT cans with ANC, so I will be comparing these Ankers to the Sony model WH-1000MX3.<br/><br/>Without question, Anker has come further, faster, than a lot of peripheral manufacturers.  The attention to detail in their products is exceptional, and downright attractive.  The build quality is great, the packaging is great, the functionality is great, the ergonomics are great.  My experience with their hubs is what leaned me toward their headphones.<br/><br/>After a bad experience with in-ear phones on an airplane, I decided I really needed some over-the-ear headphones for flying, but I didn't want to carry around a $300 pair of cans that I only use a couple dozen times a year.  I looked on Amazon, saw the reviews, read the single-star complaints, and plunked down a whopping $60 (SIXTY BUCKS?!?!  Are you kidding?) figuring they couldn't sound that awful and would be perfect for the task.<br/><br/>Let me assure you: these are the perfect headphones for flying.<br/><br/>I like the idea that if they get lost or stolen, they're easily replaceable.  I love how well they fit (with a caveat, below), and they look great.  MOST of all, holy cow do they sound great!<br/><br/>Pairing the first time was a little bit of a process, but that's to be expected the first time you play with a new toy.  After that, I put on my go-to sound check song ("Sacrilege," by Mentallo and the Fixer), cranked the volume way up, and listened.<br/><br/>I have no idea what the THD or frequency range on these are, but I don't think I care.  The "silent note" at the 1:00 mark of that song came through so clearly, without even the slightest hiss or noise, that I was madly in love with them immediately.  The dynamic range is exceptional, there was no need for me to play with the super-duper-bass-button-doodad, I just let it play.<br/><br/>The highs are crisp without tinny tones, the lows are deep without rattling the 40mm drivers (I'd love a set like this with 50mm drivers), just a very clean, direct, simple, uncomplicated sound quality that rivals the AT 500's I have and is absolutely on-par with the Sonys.<br/><br/>So I tested the ANR.  I turned on the A/C in my office, reset Sacrilege, and played the beginning again.  The A/C, as expected, kinda dampened the experience, but not any worse than the Sonys.  I reset the song again, with the A/C on, and activated ANR (it's called ANC on the Sonys).  THIS is where the two headphones differ dramatically.<br/><br/>With Noise Cancellation on, the Ankers outperform the Sonys.  Period.  It's a night and day difference, so if this is why you're considering these headphones, waste no more time and go get yourself a pair.<br/><br/>In terms of tonal quality, I put these at the top of the list of any wireless earphones anywhere.  I mean it.  They're better than ANY earbud type I've listened with, they're better than every other OTE without ANR/ANC, and they're as good as the Sonys, but with better ANR.  They're better than any WIRED earbud, too, including the Sony IEMs I used to use back when everything had an 1/8" jack.<br/><br/>Sound is, as you would expect, not 'quite' as good as the higher-end wired ATs and Sennies.  I don't think Anker would mind me saying that, because they're a completely different application.  If you play MP3s and don't think they sound worse than lossless files, you wouldn't appreciate the higher-end phones, so go buy these right away.  If you can't hear compression noise in your satellite radio, then you won't appreciate the compression of BlueTooth and you should go buy these right away.<br/><br/>That's quite a lot of good stuff to say about a pair of headphones that cost less than a decent dinner.<br/><br/>There are 3 reasons for the 4 star review.<br/><br/>1.  The ear pads are uncomfortable for my ears.  Not VERY uncomfortable, but enough that I have to adjust the phones several times during a 3 hour flight.  It might be that they're new and I just need to break them in.  If that turns out to be true, I'll adjust the review up a star.<br/><br/>2.  The battery life isn't that great.  To be fair, I only need about 12 hours of battery life and I'll just recharge them.  However, the advertised battery life is estimated at 40 hours with ANR and 60 hours without.  My experience is that with ANR I get about 22-24 hours, and without I get about 48.  Now, I have not had these very long, so I've only timed my first recharges, so if it turns out the battery life goes up with proper use, I'll add the 5th star.<br/><br/>3.  They don't fold up as small as the Sonys or even my ATs.  This one alone is not worth docking a whole star, but it's the only other complaint I have.  Carry-on space is so limited, and there's a pocket in my bag that the Sonys fit in, and these don't (not by much though).<br/><br/>Hope that helps you make a decision.  I'm very happy with these, and I just might give them some airtime at sea level just for giggles.</span>

<span>These are very comfortable and sound great! The noise canceling to me isn't that great but they do block out most of the surrounding sounds/noises.

<span>Super Hi-fidelity they are not, but they still are well in the good range, especially for what are intended for, that is protecting an acoustic drummer's ears while still providing for an enjoyable playing experience. They do fit tightly, which I have to believe is good for isolation, but you will know they are on your head.  These are NOT active noise cancelling, but rather passive noise isolating. You can still read the drums acoustically through the cones, but I find that adding just a bit from the drum mics in the monitor mix brings out more of the clarity and richness of the kit.  Still, there is enough of the drums reading through that it would be very reasonable (in my opinion) to play just hearing them passively through the cones, at least playing inside an enclosed cage. Bottom line, I was surprised by how much I liked these, especially for the relative cost.</span>

<span>I bought these a few years ago because i like to wear a set of headphones and listen to music or podcasts while i mow the lawn. They did the job and still work but i have a much better pair now that i got from a music store that i use instead. I got the new ones for a different reason but they've replaced this cheaper set as well.<br/><br/>These don't work bad for a cheap set of headphones but they're lacking in several areas. Comfort, sound, and noise cancellation. The combination of the sound being really low (volume) when i was mowing plus no noise cancellation made it very hard to hear what i was listening to. But for the price they did the trick for a couple years until they've been replaced. Without all the background noise they would be sufficient if you need a cheap set of headphones.</span>

<span>Stereo headphones have come a long way over several decades, and there have been so many advances, it's often hard to keep up with the latest technologies.  In the beginning, there was basically only ONE type, that of being, the completely over the ear, studio-type and others.  As things progressed, "earbuds" of many types began to be offered and an expensive type of these have emerged, with the advent of the I-Pod and various other portable CD and MP3 players.  I've never really liked these, as no matter how much one spends, they still have to snugly and comfortably fit the individual's ears, which is no small task, as all human ears are not created equal.  Fortunately, various forms of the original concept of over-ear, noise-canceling headphones have kept pace with the earbud variety.  Some of these are more completely over the ear than others, some are more or less outside noise-canceling types, and then there are the cheapest non-earbud types, which can vary greatly in concept and overall quality.<br/><br/>For the best experience in private listening, one needs to spend at least $50 these days, if not upwards of $100 or more.  However, these type of stereo headphones are usually very large and are not really suited to portable, on the go listening.  Still, they do not suffer from the earache of buds, and usually produce the best overall, robust sound.  In between most earbud types and most larger "monitor" types, there are so many varieties nowadays, that the general, plug-in stereo-headphones shopper is usually left quite confused when trying to pick out a suitable, high-quality model, at a reasonable price.  For almost all purposes, this is a really good buy, and I give them high marks in just about every headphone category one can think of or desire.  And the asking price is a bargain.<br/><br/>One little caveat however.  The Amazon "product description" and even mentioned in a review or two, state that the cord length is nearly 10 feet.  I think this must be referring to some earlier model or just a mistake, because the cord length of these is only about 6 feet total.  While this does not interfere with my personal use or intentions of use before I even bought a pair, sound unheard, I think this should be pointed out.  The difference between a 10-foot cord length and a 6 foot one is rather substantial.  Therefore, these are in no way suitable for "roaming the room" or dancing "to your heart's content," as the Amazon product description states.  Amazon should correct this product description.  If one desires more than a six-foot cord length however, a cheap extension can always be purchased for a few bucks at Radio Shack and the like.  It's a 6 foot cord though, not 10.<br/><br/>Outside of this however, these are really great headphones for the price, and offer terrific sound and value.  While they are "fold-able" in a way, this only applies somewhat, as they are not completely so, and attempts at making the set truly small for carrying purposes might only break them.  While they are "over-the-ear," they are not entirely of the more expensive, truly "noise-canceling" variety, though they do a fair job at this, again, for the price.  The earphones are padded and the set is nicely adjustable for nearly all head sizes, unless you have the head size of a mouse or Eraserhead.  Extended use is no problem, once you easily adjust them to comfortably fit personally.  That is, wearing these for hours will not cause any real head/ear strains or pains, either during use or afterwards, volume levels and adjustments aside.<br/><br/>These tend to lean heavily towards the bass frequencies and are enhanced to do so, although the mid-range and upper-ranges come through very good as well.  Still, since there is no equalizer function, it helps that whatever source you will be listening to with these, can be adjusted itself.  That is, if you are using these to listen to a CD or MP3 player, it helps that you are able to use an equalizer at the source, since again, the bass response here is emphasized.  I use these mainly for the computer, and my CD/MP3 player on that is fully adjustable as far as regulating highs, mids, and lows, so the extra bass is no problem.  Still, even if one is not able to adjust low and mid and high end frequencies on your player source, the overall sound is excellent on generally all forms of music and sounds, and the stereo separation between left and right is, well, right on.<br/><br/>I have always had a generally good experience with Panasonic products, and that includes higher-end, higher priced headphones from them.  While these are rather cheaply made and fragile, if you take care of them and don't ask them to do what they are clearly not intended to do, you will be pleasantly surprised.  A definite bonus is the small volume control on the cord.  This comes in real handy at times, since not all music is recorded and produced at the same volume level, and this control allows one to raise or lower the volume without touching the source player.  And again, while these headphones are not really suited for any long life with heavy abuse, and might seem too "cheaply" made for some, taking care during use negates any such negatives and I would guess these will last and perform well just about as long as you want them to.<br/><br/>I bought two pair of these, which got me free shipping, and I really can't complain.  They are great for plugging into one's computer, or using with any CD/MP3 player with an equalizer, but generally, they perform well for just about any purpose as far as headphones go.  They also fit nicely and comfortably as a "necklace" during breaks in listening.  One can easily buy much better headphones, but for the price, these offer remarkable sound at an easily affordable price, and I recommend them highly.</span>

<span>Prior to getting this, I had bought and returned two other generic cordless and corded headphones, attempting to use it with my Clavinova CSP170.  One was too short to cover my ears when fully extended (truly starnge as I've never had that before) and the other wouldn't connect.<br/><br/>This Yamaha headphone works charmingly easily.  The sound quality is soooooo clear and the stereo effect is so real that every time I started playing I had to take it off to make sure the sound came from the headphones, not the piano. LOL  Absolutely love it!<br/><br/>The only drawback is that it's not very comfortable.  The earpiece is tight not enclaving your ears inside completely.  And I haven't played longer than 30 minutes in a setting to tell since I got it to know if it'll be comfortable enough for longer usage.  Even with that, I wouldn't give it up just for the sound quality.</span>

<span>I have the 80 *OHM's......<br/><br/>*(The unit of electrical resistance, named after the nineteenth-century German physicist Georg Ohm.)<br/><br/>....... and they are EPIC! This range comes in 32 ohm, 80 ohm and 250. These are what us audiophiles call a reference headphone. 32 ohms will run on most phone and laptops etc just fine. Want to really hear how good they are? You need a DAC. 80 Ohms will work on phones etc but won't sound good and will be very quiet. 250 Ohms needs a big DAC and Amp. Everyday listening go for the 32 Ohms. Reference headphones are tuned to a very flat curve and are not really for getting down and rocking out, although you can play with a parametric equalizer and they will sound amazing! I see folks here that bought the 250's and wonder why they sound bad. Needs power! Dac and Amps are not expensive. Want big sound, thumping bass, V shaped tuning then Skullcandy Crusher EVO will be more you thing. Beyerdynamic is a German company. With German build quality and amazing sound. Look great, comfortable for long listening. This model does NOT have ANC and thats fine because you don't need it. They are closed and well insulated. Also NOT wireless! Audiophiles don't really do Bluetooth listening as it's limited in dynamic range. Most will want the 32 ohms. But if you wanna get gloriously pure sound then buy a Small DAC and boogie! 11 out of 10 RECOMMENDED!</span>

<span>I'm no expert, but I am slowly building up my affordable studio, to be a content creator, and I also love making music with Reason, and these are my first high quality studio headphones with a good even spectrum of sound reproduction and I am absolutely in love with these. Amazing sound. It also picks up most or all sub bass. I know there are supposedly better things out there, but this is like 99% or 98% perfection for a reasonable price. Good enough for my needs. And, with the 32 ohm, you don't need to buy an amplifier.<br/><br/>They grip a little tight on my big head, so prolonged use can become a bit painful.<br/><br/>!!Warning!! My wife liked them so much I had to buy her a pair.<br/><br/>Tip: if you are using Windows and the sound is distorted, make sure you go into your Windows sound properties and turn off the Equalizer, and also turn off Loudness Equalization (which will cause horrible distortion at times)</span>

<span>GET THE ASURION 3 or 4 YEAR PROTECTION PLAN! - At the time of this review the 3 year is available but not the 4; when I bought this headset they had a 4 year plan.<br/>I've owned the 250's since late October 2020, this is my first audiophile headset and I've loved it for 2 years.<br/><br/>THE COMPLAINTS:<br/>I'm forced to dock a star (for overall quality) because I lost audio in my right ear piece completely and had to send it in for repair. I got an email notifying me today that it couldn't be repaired which basically meant it would be cheaper for them to refund me the current price for a new one instead of repairing it and sending it back to me.<br/><br/>If I had to guess it was something called the "driver" that went bad since I've heard those are expensive to replace but ultimately I haven't been told what exactly failed.<br/>My next complaint is the lack of a detachable cable/jack at the point of connection with the headset itself; this is worthy of docking another star particularly for the 250's since the cable is coiled and heavier on the connection point but I won't do that with this review because I still love this headset.<br/>Furthermore I do not allow the entire length of the coiled cable to dangle from the connection point, granted it is still a possible point of failure that cannot be easily dealt with... without voiding the warranty.<br/><br/>THE REVIEW - 250 OHM:<br/>This is my first audiophile headset with a dac/amp (FiiO K5 Pro); from day one I have enjoyed the sound experience with this headset. It was an ear tingling experience that was like a massage when I first got them which was very exciting.<br/>Compared to all the terrible "office/gaming headsets" I've wasted money on over the last 15 years this headset stands above them all a champion amongst the rabble.<br/><br/>The sound is outstanding - The clarity of being able to hear everything happening in a song is something I've come to love and nothing sounds too distant or quiet/buried with this headset. When I first got the headset some of the highs did sound a little bit harsh/sharp but with time I either got used to it or it aged out with use.<br/><br/>For the bass enthusiasts - The bass may be a little lacking but I personally feel the bass is as it should be; I refuse to dock a star for a non issue. If you want more bass then get the 80's if you don't mind sacrificing the benefits of the 250's which in my opinion isn't worth it unless you plan on owning both variants of the headset.<br/><br/>The ear pads are quite comfortable - I wear glasses but I've never experienced any uncomfortable pressure being applied to them when putting the headset on.<br/>Unfortunately, If you've had your headset awhile like I have and notice external noises are louder than they used to be then chances are your ear pads are sunken/worn down and need replacing. I believe there are 3rd party replacements available but it's been about a year since I went looking.</span>

<span>I'm not an audio file or an audio expert but I've had my experiences with burro dynamic headphones before and I could say these are one of if not the best all around mid range headphones you can get for yourselves.<br/><br/>These are closed case so you get cleaner base and you can hear meds much clearer, however you can't hear any sounds outside so be complicated if you have somebody calling you.<br/><br/>Right off the gate you might have to do a little bit of adjusting with your EQ settings. personally I would recommend using high base and high boost and adjust from there. Even if you don't the overall audio quality is amazing<br/><br/>the overall structural design of the headphones are pretty tough and rugged. The headphone earpads are nice and soft and silky. I would be careful using them for prolonged periods of time, in humid areas, or if you're prone to sweating because they could start to mat and cause sorts of skin irritation.<br/><br/>5/5 these are the perfect all around headphones for under 150 bucks</span>

<span>This review is my personal experience using both headphones.  I recently lost my Sony Headphones and decided to buy Bose Headphones.  Here are some differences I have found between all three, and how I feel currently using Bose Headphones.<br/><br/>Make sure you update any headphones firmware, some issues you may experience could be fixed (with any electronic).  Understand that headphones in a warehouse are likely from the year they were manufactured, and first versions of anything tend to be buggy.<br/><br/>PERSONAL USAGE<br/>I use these headphones primarily for work.  I’ve been full time remote for over two years doing software development.  I have ADHD and having noise cancelling headphones is a must to keep my attention on work.  We use mostly Slack and Zoom as our means of communication.  Otherwise, I’m listening to music or the occasional YouTube TV.<br/><br/>PERSONAL PREFERENCES<br/>I really don’t like using in the ear headphones.  They hurt my ears after an hour or so and never were a long-term solution.  Over the ear headphones was what I liked the best since that’s what works for me.  This has been throughout my life, and they tend to fall out.<br/><br/>BEATS – NOT FOR ME OR MY HEAD<br/>My first pair of headphones were Beats Solo.  I was really impressed with wireless headphones in general.  Eventually after the Solos started to fall apart, I decided to get Beats Studio 3.  These worked much better for my head, as these were truly over my year, which I prefer.<br/><br/>The functionality is about the same between the two.  With a lot of usage, the earpieces came worn out and unglued and I had to buy replacements.  Compatible quality replacements are about $30 from different manufacturers.<br/><br/>• Pros – Lots of colors.  Foldable, and buttons are more clicks than touch sensitivity.  Useful when sweating or outdoor use.<br/>• Cons – Quality.  Wore down quickly and were not a long-term solution.  Paying more for royalties to Dr. Dre than quality assurance in general.  Feel cheap.<br/><br/>FIRST DECISION – Sony WH-1000MX3<br/>I was fortunate to try out both headphones from a family member.  I was skeptical about Sony since it wasn’t the name brand Bose was for what I wanted.  I really like how they felt on my head, and they didn’t hurt after wearing them for hours.<br/><br/>There wasn’t a noticeable difference in sound quality.  Features needed matched what I needed at the time and figured there was no point in spending more.  My work-at-home situation was different, and I was at home around 40% of the time.  The case was useful when transporting in my backpack back and forth to work.<br/><br/>Once I transitioned to full time work-at-home, some of the features that I found useful weren’t available on the Sony’s.  One big thing I would like to see is app integration.  Mute / Unmute for Slack and Zoom would really be a great feature.  Understandably, these are headphones, and are limited to what Bluetooth has to offer.<br/><br/>The app is useful, and more powerful with customization than the other two.  I found I used it a couple of times.<br/><br/>Over the three years I’ve used these, the product quality and sound we’re just like day 1.  These headphones seem to be built better than the other two.<br/><br/>• Pros –Very durable and well built.  Sound quality is great and felt good after a day’s work.  Slept with these on a bus trip.  That was my last memory.  Cheaper than the Bose.  Foldable, smaller case.<br/>• Cons – Less features than the Bose.  Misses on some sweet spots.  Harder to see which is left and right when putting them on, but not really a big deal.<br/><br/>SECOND DECISION – Bose Noise Cancelling Headphones 700<br/><br/>Once I realized I may never see my beloved Sony Headphones again, I needed something right away since work call quality was terrible.  Before I pulled the trigger on the same Sony’s, I wanted to look at to what Bose offered that Sony didn’t.  The biggest was a feature to mute / unmute.  When pouring over reviews like this one, that feature was worth paying up.  Since these are new headphones, I am still getting used to the controls.<br/><br/>I’ve only had these for a month.  Was it worth paying up for it?  Honestly, I don’t know yet.  There are more controls on the headphones which I’m figuring out.<br/>So based on a month, here’s what I found<br/>• Pros – Seems like better sound quality.  More features and possible mute integration.<br/>• Cons – Price and unproven personal durability experience.<br/><br/>TLDR / OVERALL REVIEW<br/>I won’t even compare the Beats headphones.  Sony and Bose are a step way above Beats.<br/>METRICS<br/>• Sound Quality – Bose slightly.  My ears are bad, I’m not an audiophobia as others may be.  Spotify is what I listen to primarily.  The slight edge goes to Bose, only because it’s a small enough difference.<br/>• Mute / Unmute – Bose.  The main reason for choosing Bose instead of Sony for my current headphones.<br/>• Noise Cancelling – Leaning towards Bose.  There is customization of three different settings within the Bose app to set up preferences from 0-10.  Sony sort of has the same thing, but not directly.<br/>• Microphone – Sony.  Never had any issues of cutting out or “robo voice”.  Initially I am “cutting out” and “in a wind tunnel” from peers.<br/>• Bose - Multiple Device Connectivity (multiple Bluetooth Connections) was a feature I didn’t even think about.  Bose allows for multiple connections which comes in handy.  I found myself unpairing and pairing devices with Sony.  It was sort of a hassle that seemed unnecessary.  If the Bluetooth source device is off, it should default to another.<br/>• Headset Features, Bose wins.  Although I haven’t had the time to get into what the buttons do, there are more of them.  The buttons themselves seem a little better than the Sony’s.<br/>• Headset Quality – Sony.  I really don’t care for the artsy plastic that goes over the top of your head.  Sony also folds up where Bose doesn’t.  An argument can be made that the Bose are lighter than the Sony’s, but that didn’t matter to me.<br/>• In the box – Sony slightly.  Sony included an airplane adapter where Bose did not.  I prefer the case from Sony than I do from Bose.<br/>• Daily Use – Too Early to determine, likely Sony.  Sony’s headphones were excellent, as of now I haven’t used the Bose headphones.<br/>• Bluetooth Range – Bose decisively.  Bluetooth location hasn’t changed.  Dead spots where I wore my Sony’s didn’t exist with the Bose. There is a little bit of breakup in the headphones in dead spots, but nearly not as much as the Sony’s.<br/>• Companion Application – Bose.  Much more customization of buttons versus Sony.<br/><br/>WINNER – Sony<br/><br/>I’m going to put a disclaimer on this, so take this for what it is.<br/>With my new set of Bose Headphones, there is a problem with the microphone.  Assuming that this was just a fluke, I returned them since they were defective.  So, my review is irrelevant of that from that aspect.<br/><br/>Both are great, I lean Sony just because of the price difference.<br/><br/>I wanted to give the Bose Headphones a little more time before getting a refund and getting the Sony’s again.  Right now, they’re cutting out where Sony rarely did that.  Even in that case, my computer was slow, or the application used went haywire.  That’s something that’s a no-go for me.  I ended up contacting Bose support, went through the normal stuff, is your battery charged, are you far away to a point they created a return ticket for a replacement.  Once sent in, they would give me a new pair within 5 business days.<br/><br/>Fortunately, after writing this review, I ended up finding my missing Sony headphones, which would be what I would have bought instead of a Bose replacement.<br/><br/>As with any review, only you can decide if the extra money for Bose is worth it.  I can see it both ways.  For me, these headphones are for basic usage.  The extra money wasn’t worth the upgrade.  Defective products happen.  I just hoped that their flagship headphones would have worked better.  Regardless, spending hundreds of dollars to replace something missing is an instant return anyway.<br/><br/>I hope this helped someone.  Sorry for too much text.</span>

<span>*Introduction:<br/><br/>I bought the Bose NC 700 right around the new year in 2021, so about a month ago. Like many people, I've been working from home for the past year. However, I have 2 young children who can get noisy, so I wanted some noise cancelling headphones. Also, I like listening to music and gaming, so I'll address that as well. Here is my review, broken down by subject:<br/><br/>*Noise Cancelling:<br/><br/>When I set out to get a pair of noise cancelling headphones, my main priority was, of course, noise cancelling. Naturally, I gravitated towards Bose due to their fantastic history here. I have never owned a pair of active noise cancelling headphones before, so I can't really compare to anything. However, I can say they are amazing. Any low-frequency constant noise is basically gone. I have a small office room with 2 central air registers; I can't hear either of them with the headphones on. I can hear my kids when they are loud, but the "punch" is gone, and it feels like it takes a level 10 crying baby, down to a level 7. All of this is without music on. Turn any music on, and it becomes near impossible to hear anything. I mean it; turn on some rock or rap and kiss noise goodbye. I'm sure the offerings from other companies are great too, but these are wonderful at noise cancelling.<br/><br/>*Sound Quality:<br/><br/>Sound quality is difficult to measure as it's subjective, so I'll try my best. I think the Bose NC 700's sound quality is pheromonal. I can hear lots of fine detail, and nothing has ever felt clipped or muddy, unless the music itself is. I personally really like the sound signature (think how the headphones are tuned, not how "good" they are), but a lot of people want more bass. Keep in mind, these do have good bass, but they won't turn your brain to mush.  I am not a bass lover, so these are great for me. I typically stream Spotify from my computer or phone at the highest quality setting and set the app's EQ (see below for more info) to low = 0, mid = 2, high = 5. So, if you really want bass, I would try the Sony XM4's, but these sound really good and clear.<br/><br/>*Design / Comfort:<br/><br/>This is probably the trickiest for me to review. I’ll start with looks. I think they look cool and different from other headphones. They have a good amount of adjustability and feel pretty solid. They have 3 physical buttons: a noise cancellation level button, and voice assistant button, and a Bluetooth pairing / power button. However, I do not like the silicone headband. It feels cheap (to me at least) and isn’t overly comfortable. It doesn’t hurt, but it doesn’t feel good. Same goes for the leatherette ear cups. They’re fine, but do not feel premium. For nearly $400 I want something more luxurious.  As a quick aside I’m 6’ 4” and wear glasses. After 6 ish hours wearing these off and on the tops of my ears where my glasses sit starts to hurt. The clamping force (for me) is a bit tight. You can reduce the clamping force by extending the earcups, but for my head it makes the earcups be too low, and that’s not comfortable either. It’s not a terrible thing, but I’m usually happy to take them off at the end of the day. That’s still almost a full work day’s time which is pretty good.<br/><br/>*Battery life:<br/><br/>They are advertised for 20 hours, I’m not sure how much time I actually get but it sounds about right. I usually charge them every other day or every 2 days. I like the battery is measured in hours rather than percentage. Since I don’t travel this isn’t a big deal anyways, but you can get better battery life from other headphones.<br/><br/>*Touch controls:<br/><br/>Touch controls work fine for me. I think this comes down to preference. I’ve had no trouble getting used to them, even swiping up/down for volume. Somehow the volume swipe considers your speed or force to change how much you adjust volume per swipe. A full swipe up / down is about 25/30% in windows.<br/><br/>*Bose Music App:<br/><br/>This section (and the next) is where my review goes off a cliff. I hate the app. When I first got the headphones, the “simple” paring that the little user pamphlet outlined didn’t work. I had to manually pair through my phone. When pairing with my windows 10 laptop, I initially couldn’t get it to work at all. I had to find this post: Steps to pair NC 700 headphones with Windows 10 - Bose Community - 293028 to get it to work. Also, my headphones came uncharged. Between the lack of charge and Bluetooth issues it took about 30-45 minutes before I first heard anything with the headphones.<br/><br/>Sometimes, when you open to music app to change to EQ or something else, your headphones will not be detected. The only solution I’ve found so far is to reboot. This is extremely annoying since it takes about 10-15 seconds to reboot your headphones (see below for why that is).<br/><br/>Another annoyance is that the self-voice level option for when you’re in headset mode is buried withing the app settings. This should be part of the initial settings when you first open the app. You also cannot map it to a tap combo short cut. I would love to be able to do that since I’m adjusting all the time due to my surrounding sound levels when I’m on a call.<br/><br/>1 Last thing, and I wasn’t sure whether to put this in the app or headphone software section. You cannot disable the multiple Bluetooth connection feature. Are you on a zoom meeting on your laptop and you get a call on your phone? Guess what, your audio, both input and output, automatically switch to the phone ringing in your ears. Listening to Spotify on your phone and then the windows chime plays? The windows chime interrupts your music. Even if your windows volume is muted, the audio switch to no sound for the duration of the windows chime. This wouldn’t be a problem, if you could disable the feature. You could unpair and repair devices manually, but if you unpair your phone where the music app is installed, the music app will “forget” the device and you have to go through the setup process again for a new device. It’s mind-boggling stupid and I can’t believe this app made it to market as is. For reference I have a One Plus 6T. Related to this, I’ve never had a successful switch from computer to phone when a call comes in. I can hear the ringing initially, but not the caller once I accept the call. Also, they cannot hear me at all.<br/><br/>*Headphone Software:<br/><br/>The headphone’s software itself is annoying. Not quite as bad as the app, but far from good. Upon startup, the headphone’s voice will tell you the amount of battery you have left and the 2 devices you’re currently connected to. At first this didn’t bug me, but after a while, it is extremely annoying. Most of the time, I know what devices I’ll be connected to. Just let it be a triple tap shortcut or something similar.<br/><br/>Also, there are definite problems somewhere along the chain of input microphone processing. Often my colleagues say I’m cutting in and out when I talk in lower tones. This usually occurs when the central air is running, and it’s input noise canceling is running. As far as I know, there’s no way to reduce or turn off the input noise cancelling. This is frustrating, since one of the selling points for these headphones is good mic quality. It’s very disappointing.<br/><br/>*Summary:<br/><br/>In summary the headphones sound great, but the day to day software issues make these a hard pass at $400. I don’t have the Sony XM4’s or other competitors for comparison, but I cannot recommend against these headphones enough. This will be the first and last Bose product I will own for a long time.</span>

<span>I saw others complaining about having to download the bose app to use these. That is absolutely not true.  All you do is connect to them the same way you would connect to any other bluetooth device.  I also saw a claim that you are required to create a bose account to use them.  Again, that is simply false.  I skipped right past that in the app.<br/><br/>What the app does is allow you to modify the onboard controls.  The touch controls on the right cup seem to work fine.  I'm still trying to figure out the sensitivity of the volume control.<br/><br/>The sound has been clear and good quality.</span>

<span>For starters, I’m not really going to review the sound quality, because in short they sound like a $300 pair of headphones. You can tweak the settings and make a custom EQ in the Bose Music app, so you can make it what you will. I listen to a lot of jazz, instrumental, metal, and I’m satisfied.<br/><br/>My main issues are with this current generation of ANC and the build quality on the Bose 700’s.<br/><br/>ANC: On one hand, it’s good. In certain environments I feel like I’m in a bubble and I can’t hear the world beyond. It’s perfect, just my music. In others, I can hear more than I would like. We’re talking, literally, I can listen to classical symphonic music on a lawn mower at a decent volume and hear the dynamics. It’s fantastic. There, I’m truly impressed. However at work, I sit at a desk and there’s machinery some 300 feet away. Drill press, a saw, and chiefly a large fan that’s always on for ventilation. It is loud, yes, but I also get the sense even on the highest setting, ANC isn’t fully engaged. I think this because I’ve ever had the 700’s on and sneezed, dropped something, or otherwise had a sudden loud noise nearby and I can feel what’s like a diaphragm move. Pressure changes in the cup, and momentarily that super loud sound is muted greater than the atmospheric noises. E.G. an alarm goes off at work and each individual tone going off results in a higher noise cancellation sensation. When I have ANC maxed out, I want it truly maxed out, not on an algorithm. You can already adjust what level you want ANC on, so I see no benefit to this feature. If I want to be deaf to the world, considering the original MSRP, I better be. If anything else it’s very jarring to hear the accompanying “popping” that occurs with the added acute noise cancellation.<br/><br/>Build quality: See picture…I’ve had these three months, have only worn them daily for two weeks as a test and the stainless steel frame has scratches from the ear cups. Also, every time I turn my head, a wonderful rubbing sound of the ear cup turning. In this department I am a bit of a snob. I typically don’t buy headphones that make a lot of frictional noise. As in I’ll literally jiggle display pairs of headphones to see if I can hear the plastic on plastic rubbing sound cheap pairs are plagued by. Anytime I’ve worn them outside I’ve wiped them off with a microfiber cloth and exclusively store them in the case. Aside from the vibrations from the aforementioned lawnmower, I have babied these due to the price. Hearing a plasticky popping sound whenever I turn my head, chew, adjust my glasses, is not something I expected from headphones marketed as having a stainless frame. This alone makes me wish I would have bought the Sony MK4’s.</span>

<span>If you are looking for the most posh, comfortable headphones ever, with the most outstanding sound, you may want to pass these up. But if you need a solid set of great sounding headphones, for doing studio work, or for some casual listening, I don't see how you can go wrong with these. They sound very crisp and clean, and reasonably rich, even when using no equalizer settings to assist them. But they do fall a bit short of having "upper end" headphone sound quality.  But you don't expect to get that kind of sound with less than 25 dollar headphones. But the sound they do create, seems much better than I would have expected for  the price I paid. And to me, they are larger than they appeared on the promotional photo, which is also good.<br/>But they are inexpensive headphones, and as such they do have some of the drawbacks usually found in  cheaper headphones.<br/>Firstly, they wear a bit tight, and a bit hot. And no amount of adjusting I tried seemed to help. So you may want to try something else more comfortable, which probably means more expensive, for longer listening sessions.  Also, I was surprised to find that they do knock out some of the outside ambient noise. But they aren't like some of the ones that cancel almost all of it out. And I wouldn't expect that from these either. But I was pleasantly surprised that there is a decent, or a measurable degree of noise cancelling with these.<br/>And I like the "L" plug in's much better. than the straight in type plugs. But in the defense of these headphones, the cord is heavy enough, and the transition seems well designed, so this should not be an issue for years to come.<br/>And another positive is, that the jack worked on my cellphone, right away, even with my case on it, which for me is rare, for any out of the box larger headphones.  Usually I have to do some carving on the end of the rubber part of jack, to trim them down, so they jack will go through that smaller hole in my phone case,  which is frustrating. But these plugged right into my phone, case and all, the first thing, with no modifications needed.<br/>And maybe these deserve 5 stars, for the money.  But I reserve 5 stars for top notch products only. And since the comfort level is a factor on these, and I don't want to seem to be misleading peopel, so 4 stars it is.</span>
