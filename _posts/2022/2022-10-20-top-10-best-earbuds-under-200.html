<span>After pirchashing and wearing for almost a month now I still can’t go 5 mins without one of my earbuds falling out of my ear I think the design doesn’t allow it to sit comfortably in your ear, nor get a good fit.</span>

<span>I was able to verify that these worked by connecting them to my iPhone very easily. Once I knew they worked, I was very disappointed with the sound quality. The JBL system I had in my Prius some years ago was hands down the best and clearest sounding car stereo I’ve ever  had. That was what I wanted and why I selected JBL. Unfortunately, I was disappointed.<br/><br/>The sound is very thin and reedy. There’s hardly any bass. I adjusted the EQ in my iPhone to Increase Bass, and also tried several other settings in hopes that would remedy the problem, but it didn’t. My AirPods sound far better.<br/><br/>Once I verified that they worked, I instructed my phone to forget them and reset them to factory settings. I had to await arrival of a Bluetooth transmitter - my tv is a smart tv, but apparently only works with Wi-Fi and not Bluetooth. I purchased a Trond V5.0 transmitter. No matter what I did, I could not get the ear buds to pair with the Trond. But then came the final nail in the coffin.<br/><br/>I read on a different website (I purchased these on Amazon and lines at the description closely). On the Best Buy website, someone asked about connection to a tv because they also had connectivity issues. There, JBL told the customer that these earbuds are not recommended for tv - and that was why I purchased them in the first place. If they aren’t suitable for tv, why not mention that, like, ANYWHERE in the description?<br/><br/>Bottom line is, if these earbuds are only useful for listening to music, I think you could get a less expensive pair that would sound better. They do seem like they are good quality, but I would much rather just stick with AirPods for music. And I’ll have to get something different for tv, because apparently, these are not low latency enough, even though the description does say they use AptX Low Latency.</span>

<span>Let me preface this by saying that I went with these to replace a previous JBL model that I had very good use out of. The batteries simply stopped holding a charge after nearly 4 years of daily use.<br/><br/>I am going to break this up into a few points that I hope help others when deciding on this product.<br/>1. I mainly use these for audio books at a rate of around 90 minutes a day, give or take. I have used them for hands free calling as well. They preform well at both functions. Though I do not listen to music with them very often, the sound quality is average. They are small ear buds, do not expect a huge sound from them.<br/>2. The battery life seems to be as good if not better than the previous model. I get about 2 weeks use at an hour to hour and a half per day nearly every day, so 15-20 hours per charge.<br/>3. The ear buds them self are very comfortable. They feel very light and I often forget I have one or both of them in. The noise cancelling aspect is adequate without completely blocking out background noise that you may need to hear. The straight portion that aims down from your ear helps to keep them in a good position.<br/>The controls on the side of the ear buds are ok. I had to keep in mind that they were relying on touch, rather than a button press, but once I was used to them I had the pause, fast forward, and rewind controls down pretty good. I like that they are more reactive than the previous model which had a hard push needed to actually get them to pause and there was no ff/rw option.<br/>4. Now the part that I do not like at all. The charging/storage case is just designed poorly. Either the case needs to be a little larger or the top needs to open all of the way, not just a 90 degree angle. This makes the buds very difficult to get out of the case. I have dropped these more in the past 2 weeks than the past 4 years with the prior model just trying to get them out of the case.<br/><br/>I am going to say overall that I give these a generous 4 out of 5 for my usage (again I do not listen to music through them often).</span>

<span> After hearing the buzz and seeing the leaks on these over the last few months, I was anxiously awaiting their release.<br/><br/>Now, with them in hand (or ears, rather), I have some serious concerns.<br/><br/>I wanted these for the use of listening to music and equally, if not more importantly,  for hands free phone calls.<br/><br/>For the record: I have paired these with my Samsung S8 phones. I have alternated between two S8's and have found identical results<br/><br/>Being a 100% Android and anti-Apple consumer, I can honestly say that Apple got it right with the AirPods.  Not only for sound but for call transmitting and receiving audio quality.  The Galaxy Buds Live may not be up to the same level in the call quality department.<br/><br/>Call Quality:  From my first call, the audio I heard from the caller sounded quite good. Then the audio I was hearing began to sound a bit distorted and I kept experiencing a lot of digital noise. What I found is, if I put my phone in my pocket, or I'm holding my phone and I put my hand down by my side, it almost seems like I lose connection or there is interference. As if the signal is poor. But, if I'm holding the phone upright, or almost right near my face, the sound seems fine. Shouldn't be like this.  On the plus side, in comparison with my Bose headphones, multiple callers said these sounded equally as good on their end.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, I have to rate the call quality as Very Bad at this point. After being sent a second pair, same exact issue.<br/>I am curious if this is some form of a software incompatibility issue with the Samsung Galaxy S8.  Because the call quality is so poor, and I intended on using these heavily for calls, these are now likely to be returned.<br/><br/>The Fit:  Very interesting but nice. They're light, comfortable and once you trust that they won't fall out, you really feel like they're not even there.<br/><br/>Music/Audio:  Sounds great. I'm not a $1000 headphone audiophile.  It needs to sound clear with your highs and mids defined and just good in general. Sound quality is very good. Here's the catch was that though. I started noticing the same signal issue that I was noticing with the call quality. While I was watching/listening to a YouTube video and I put the phone in my pocket or I walked away from the phone, mind you only a couple feet away, it seems like there's interference or the reception is bad. It cuts out constantly. Again, this shouldn't be happening.<br/><br/>Active Noise Canceling:  I'd have to say that my Bose QC35ii's are my benchmark for ANC. That bar is pretty high.  The Galaxy Buds Live disappointingly offer little in terms of ANC technology.  If you're looking for the same level if ANC that you get from a good pair of over the ear or in ear silicone tip ear buds, this will not measure up.<br/><br/>I experimented with this.  While sitting indoors, in a relatively quiet setting, you almost feel like you notice the ANC effectiveness.  Walking down the street with moderate car/traffic noise, I noticed absolutely no ANC effect. Merely an automatic battery drain at best.<br/><br/>Wearable App:  Good.  It would be nice to have a more dynamic equalizer option rather than the "canned" sound profiles.<br/><br/>Overheating:  I've yet to actually find information on this in the manual, but I believe that they have an overheating prevention feature where the individual earbud will begin beeping continuously in your ear. The audio playing, in my case a podcast, doesn't stop but a continuous beep begins. Not being able to figure out why, my best guess is that this is an overheating warning. I had been sitting outside and my left side was facing the sun. It was not excessively hot out and the actual left earbud did not feel warm or get warm in my ear. However, it repeatedly kept beeping.<br/><br/>General Performance:<br/>- In the home office and around the house: Not bad. I enjoy the lightweight design. As long as my phone is in front of me and not in a pocket, audio and call reception and quality are good.<br/>- On the elliptical: Nice. Comfortable and stay in place. Slight movement as you build a bit of a sweat.<br/>- Outside for a walk: ANC is non-existent. I also notice wind noise if it's a little breezy. By breezy, I mean a very light and intermittent wind. Not a hurricane.<br/>- On a bicycle ride: Crazy wind noise. Very off-putting, unfortunately.<br/>- Online Microsoft Teams Meeting (Android App on S8): I was told that I sounded distant and the audio was thin. As soon as I disconnected and called the person directly, they said I sounded great.<br/><br/>Summary: Very disappointed at this point. This is primarily due to the reception issues.  The price point is great for what I had expected. However, for what they are, I'd just as soon spend much, much less for a set of wireless headphones since making calls with these simply doesn't seem to be a good feature, out of the gate.<br/><br/>After running through all of the same with two separate sets of GBL's, using two different S8's, I've gotten identical results. I'm hoping that perhaps this may just be an S8 compatibility issue, as indicated earlier. I would enjoy editing this review to be nothing short of incredible, in the future.<br/><br/>Because they are so new, Samsung telephone support couldn't be all that helpful. With these being, literally, on the market for only a couple of days, there wasn't a whole lot of trouble shooting assistance available.<br/><br/>At this point, I've gone through two sets of these and have not seen a difference between the two. I'm torn whether or not I should return them. I so badly want them to work out. But, I'm finding that they're just not measuring up.</span>

<span>Alright.. This review had to be cut to multiple sections because so much can be said about them. Biggest take-away: Point (3)!<br/><br/>(1) When I initially put on these buds, the sound was wayyy low. On Day 2, I swapped the ear tips and all the sounds are SO much louder, mainly because the fit is so extremely important when wearing these buds! Just a tiny bit off and the sound is completely gone.<br/><br/>(2) The battery life is just an absolute beast.. Getting at the minimum 5 hrs but I never passed 3 hrs simply because I have arrived to my destination by then. I only have had the earbuds for a day, so this review will get updated whenever I do get more use in.<br/><br/>(3) Bass: At initial use, the bass was basically not even present especially since these are open set earbuds. PLEASE DO THIS TO GET MORE BASS!!! I have no idea why this worked so magically because I was simply playing around with the Galaxy Wearable App (remember to also download the Galaxy Bud Live plugin when the app asks). When you enter the wearable app, go to Labs. When in Labs TURN ON Relieve Pressure with Ambient Sound. THIS LITERALLY WENT FROM 20% BASS TO 90% BASS IDK WHY BUT DO IT IF YOU WANT BASS!!!<br/><br/>(4) Overall Sound Quality: This is hard to judge, but as for my gaming PC, I purposely have an open-ear headset so that it widens my soundstage and the sound simply is better in my personal opinion. When I got these earbuds, it was sort of like having speakers blasting at me in but without everyone else hearing it. In other word, unlike most of the earbuds I've used that has a passive seal for noise cancelling, these allow for very good spatial awareness. You can also tell how loud you are speaking to a person because you don't have as tight of a seal from these earbuds.<br/><br/>(5) Active Noise-Cancelling: Everyone is saying these earbuds don't have good Active Noise-Cancelling and they are sort of true, as long as you know how to use it. After figuring out the trick in Point (3) of this review, I started to notice that the Active Noise-Cancelling started to work wonders. The increased bass helped to drown out some of the higher notes. I still hear them of course, but a whole lot less when that Ambient Sound option is turned on. (This option just single handedly made my experience with these 10x better than I had initially anticipated!!)<br/><br/>(6) Comfort: Very subjective, but at first these were not that comfortable with the smaller eartip that came with the earbuds. After changing them to the larger and circular ones, these went from uncomfortable to "I can wear these to sleep and not be painful tomorrow morning". I literally walked to work and forgot I was still wearing them until someone told me 1/2 an hr later why I was still wearing them **embarrassed** but you get the idea!<br/><br/>Note: These are my first pair of expensive earbuds as the others were all $20-$50 sets. My overall experience with these earbuds went from "okay, but low-end earbuds could do the same thing" to "I see why I paid the price and I don't regret whatsoever". Buy these and look no further if you're okay with having spatial awareness when outside!! I wanted these specifically so that I can still hear what's going on around me without having to take out 1 or both of my earbuds for safety reasons.</span>

<span>I don't usually write review on amazon,<br/>but I was just really not happy with what samsung is doing here.<br/><br/>First of all, let me introduce myself, I am a audiophile that has experienced and owned quite a lot audio equipment from extreme high end ones (the $50,000 hifiman Shangri la system), to flagship overear/in ear (beyerdynamic T1, xelento) that cost around  $800 today, to extreme cheap ones like the under $10 ve monk.<br/><br/>But I am NOT the type of audiophile that only nitpicking sound quality in his/her subjective way and care nothing about comfort, longevity, good features etc.<br/><br/>Far from that, I value a good fit and comfort over many other qualities. and for certain type of headphones, I value  features like convenience, noise cancelling over sound quality.<br/><br/>But I have a MINIMUM BAR of sound quality of course.<br/><br/>HERE COMES THE REVIEW of the galaxy buds live:<br/>OVERALL:  2/5<br/>I give it overall 2 out of 5 because there are products (namely galaxy buds+) that's better then this in nearly every way and has lower price. And buds live has its own issues.<br/><br/>COMFORT and FIT:  3/5<br/>IN SHORT, need some work to adjust the fit, some parts irritates skin after long wearing.<br/><br/>If you absolutely can not wear in-ear earphones, then this is not bad and this is pretty much your only choice for  true wireless headphones along side the original air-pods.<br/>But the issue is, everywhere this little thing touches your ear is hard plastic except for the tinny little rubber tip that sits in the upper part of your outer ear. And that rubber part has a pretty small contact area, your ear will be irritated for usage over 30 min or so.<br/>And it's not the easiest earphones to adjust its position correctly and securely, you'll find yourself adjust it quite a lot before you can finally enjoy your music. And the fit affects the sound quality a lot, by a lot I mean if you don't push down the lower part to ensure the speaker is as close to your ear canal as possible, this thing would sound bass light, and if you push it down all the all, it's absolutely bass heavy. I can imagine different people hearing quite different sound from it because of there ear shape. There's a reason for high-end ear-buds all using in-ear design.<br/>ADD: the case is among the smallest, which is a plus. but it's not a standout quality in 2020<br/><br/>FEATURES: 1/5<br/>IN SHORT: noise isolation is worse then regular in-ear headphones without active noise cancelling feature. and touch controls are usable but nothing special.<br/><br/>The buds live should NOT be advertised as a noise cancelling headphones, this is one of the two reason I'm writing this review. In fact, the noise cancelling level is substantially worse then the galaxy ear buds+ which has no noise cancelling feature.  pretty much ANY in-ear headphones will isolate better then buds live.<br/>The touch control and all other small feature set are nothing special, usable and usual is the word I would give.<br/><br/>THE ESSENTIALS for true wireless headphones 3/5<br/>IN SHORT: good battery life, unstable connection, short connection range.<br/><br/>the good thing is the battery life is good, not the best, but good for most. around 6 - 8 hours without noise cancelling on.<br/>The connection however, is not good. a lot of the time it has syncing issues when connected to my windows computer, usually put them back in case would solve the problem, this problem is quite frequent that it would annoy you quite a bit. And non of my other true wireless headphones have this issue, at least not to the extent that it annoys me. Connect to my galaxy s10 have much less issue though, only have sync issue when switching from device to device occasionally. The connection range is not good too, the signal cuts off completely when I walk from my desk to the bathroom, and for the reference, at the same spot at my bathroom, my airpods pro works normally without any signal loss, my galaxy buds+ would buzz in and out a bit.<br/><br/>THE SOUND:<br/>IN SHORT: acceptable,  3/5<br/>The sound I would describe as V shaped, somewhat muddy in low to mid frequency. average resolution, a better then average sound stage and imaging. I feel the driver in this has potential, but it's restricted by the ear bud design choice, since this thing has no seal, they have to adding quite a lot of bass by eq/dsp to compensate for it. And I think they overdone it, and ironically, the bass is certainly plenty in terms of quantity, but it doesn't have the smooth, fast and deep extension quality that comes out of galaxy buds+ from samsung themself.<br/>The mids are overshadowed by the lows. simple as that.<br/>The highs are average, nothing exciting about it.<br/>The sound stage are good for in-ear, imaging are above average too, but the lack of detail (which is understandable for a bluetooth heaphone without aptX or LDAC support) means you can't really pinpoint, and the muddy bass is not helping.<br/><br/>Conclusion:<br/><br/>this is a complete downgrade from the galaxy buds+ I have. It's harder to wear, less comfortable except for people who cannot withstand in-ear design. It has shorter battery per charge, from around 12 hours from buds+ to around 7 hours from buds live. It has worse noise isolation, which is unacceptable since it's in the advertise. The sound quality is average, not nearly as good as galaxy buds+ in terms of bass and mids, somewhat at the same level in highs and soundstage. And buds live has a higher price tag. And these two product come from the same company, which annoys me quite a bit. What's the thinking behind it, samsung and your AKG department? advertising? something new? "the new open ear noise cancelling?" it's just wrong in my opinion.<br/><br/>My recommendation for true wireless headphones as in time of writing this review:<br/><br/>The utility beast:  airpods pro<br/><br/>Pros:<br/>1. Probably the most stable and furthest connection from named brand, for ios, or for android and windows.<br/>Very good audio/video latency, which makes it very usable for mobile/casual gaming, or even just watching video.<br/>2. A solid noise cancelling and transparent, natural sounding is the word I would call the feeling of both noise cancelling and transparent mode. The mic quality is also among the best if not the best in true wireless.<br/>3. A comfortable fit. less pressurized feeling then most in-ear headphones. a bit chunky, so not the most comfortable for your long session listening, but if you don't jam it too hard into your ear, you can listen to airpods pro for quite a long time, over 2 hours I would say.<br/>4. A relaxing and enjoyable sound. it's doesn't have much detail/resolution, lack some high notes in particular, average sound-stage, not very pin-point in imaging, too. But I gotta say, it sounds good enough, even for audiophile like me. Part of the reason is the noise cancelling helps to make sure you can hear as much performance as it can offer. The other part is that the tuning is just easy to listen to, a good bass extension without too much mid-bass, a bit mid-forward makes the vocal stand out, which is good for a lot of the mainstream pop music, a reduced high makes it easy to enjoy your music for a long period of time during travel. And the sound is also very consistent,  a deeper or shallower insertion doesn't affect it much.<br/><br/>Cons:<br/>less then 5 hour of usage per charge might not enough for some.<br/>and really, besides not "great" sounding for those who can not withstand anything less then true audiophile quality, that's the only shortcoming I can think of.<br/><br/>A taste into audiophile world: galaxy buds / buds+<br/>Yes I have own both buds/buds+<br/>Pro:<br/>1. good fit and comfort, low-profile looking. You may feel a little pressure when you first put them like most in-ears. But they are by far the most comfortable true wireless earphones for long listening sessions.<br/><br/>2. Great sounding. I challenge you to find in-ear headphones that sounds significantly better then these, wired or wireless. Especially for the original galaxy buds, As they are under $100 today and honestly, besides bass not as deep as buds+, I prefer the sound of the original galaxy buds since the mids are not as recessed and highs are more smooth comparing to buds+. sound stage and imaging are both very good in buds/buds+;<br/><br/>3. Great battery life per charge and good mic quality. over 12 hours of battery life per charge and a good enough mic quality is the reason you buy buds+ over buds<br/><br/>Cons:<br/>connection and range are not the best (but totally usable).<br/>battery in case only provides one more charge for both buds/buds+. so if you forget to put your buds/buds+ in the case once over night, you might lose half of your total battery life.<br/>For people need active noise-cancelling for travel, these don't offer the feature, (but it still block quite some noise for everyday use).<br/><br/>For those considering sony and sennheisers's true wirelless, Consider the large size of them, they might not fit you, and the cases are quite large too. So I just don't bother trying them.</span>

<span>Sound quality is great! And they are very comfortable. You can forget their even in. Downsides is for me that it seems like my ear produces more for a lack of better word, ear wax trying to remove the foreign object out of my ear. You'll have to continuously push them back in your ear while running. Then the song will pause or skip. And once your hands get moist from sweating it's nearly impossible to pause or skip to the next song. And if your hair gets damp it will pause the song when it bounce up against the buds while running. Would have given 5 stars if smaung sold the case separately if you lose it. Or be able to replace one bud if lost.</span>

These are great, but don't give me the same round and fat bass that the last set did, so I've been a little disappointed there.

<span>Before you read this review I can save you a lot of time.  Buy these.  However if you want more info than that you can read on, but keep in mind this is not an in depth review on how these buds are technically.  I could get into frequency range before and after break in with pink noise and all kinds of other crazy crap, but I'm not going to bore you with that.  You might be able to find that type of review in one of the other 1900 five star reviews.  I'm just going to give you, what I hear, aside from the voices.  But seriously, you can save yourself a lot of time by just buying them.  C'MON THEY'RE ONLY $6.  Okay, waste your time if you want.  Read on if you must.  But you'll probably be disappointed.<br/><br/>I normally don't write reviews because English is not my first language... bad English is, but on these I just had too.  Let me start out by saying before these I had an awesome pair of Bose In Ear Headphones, the old ones.  They cost about $100.  I did not pay for them.  Someone else who is dumb did, and then further proved their lack of intelligence by giving them to me.  Actually, they were a, very generous, Christmas gift I got a few years back from the company I work for.  Those ear buds were awesome, but like everything else I love, they died.  I did manage to get several years of good use out of them, and I treated them like a red headed step child.  The fact they lasted as long as they did only goes to show that Bose makes quality stuff.  Well, now that I think about it, for $100 maybe they should have been impervious to damage by human means, or possibly even mythical means.  I'm going to say it, they should have been Centaur proof.<br/><br/>So after what I refer to as the "Great Loss of 2010."  I then went on a search for a decent pair of replacement buds, in the $20 range; because as is proof by how I treated the Bose ear buds, I shouldn't be allowed to have nice things. I tried many different types of replacement buds from different manufacturers.  I'm not going to list them all because I don't have that kind of time.  I will say through all my testing that 50% were just okay, and the other 50%... well I would rather have listened to the final death rattle of a puppy.  A really cute and sweet looking puppy.  You know, the ones you see on the TV that make you feel guilty for not donating to the ASPCA.<br/><br/>Well, after losing yet another pair of the okay ones, how I had those Bose for so long I have no idea, I needed a replacement and decided to try a different brand.  I went again to the internet and performed the search, "good cheap headphones for someone who should not have good things."  I hit enter, the search results came up, and clicked on a link that appeared to be a tech review site and let me tell you... they are really good at disguising porn sites to look like normal sites in search results these days.  So after seeing something that I will never be able to unsee, I came across the Panasonic RPHJE120S and figured for $6 on Amazon I'll give them a shot.  I've wasted $6 on far worse.<br/><br/>They arrived the day before I ordered them, as Amazon has awesome shipping, especially if you are a Prime Member.  I grabbed my Zune, no I don't have an IPOD because I believe Apple, and the late Bea Arthur, are trying to kill me.  I put in the buds and selected a track to play, expecting either okay sound or sound so bad that I would black out and wake up naked in a quarry with a dead rodent in my mouth.  The latter has only ever happened to me twice in my life... three times tops... four at the most... possibly every Friday.  Once my selected track started playing I was just amazed, to find my neighbor on his roof trying to fix his satellite dish in a t-shirt, pair of boxers, rubber rain boots, and a tool belt, with no tools in it, unless you count him.  The sound out of the ear buds was awesome too!  Clear highs, nice bass, just great frigging sound.  It sounded like the puppy was right in the room with me.  Then I turned on some music and was further impressed.  Initially the highs in certain songs seemed a bit, too high, but over time the buds broke in to be just pure awesome.  A $6 dollar pair of headphones that competed with those $100 Bose buds I had.  Don't get me wrong, Bose is Bose, but to even approach sound quality on par with those Bose buds in a $6 pair of Panasonic's is damned amazing.  But be warned, these buds ARE NOT Centaur proof.  I checked.  They are fairy resistant though.<br/><br/>I have also found them pretty comfortable, and they stay in my ears pretty well.  I have fallen asleep with these things in.  I did an experiment in which I tried to give myself night terrors using audio.  It worked, I have never felt the same since.  I may have also released something that can only be described as pure evil into the world.  But like I said they were real comfortable and stayed in my ears even when I woke up screaming and thrashing about.<br/><br/>Maybe if you are insane, or a complete audiophile, or both, because they usually go hand in hand, you can pick apart these headphones.  I have friends who are audiophiles/insane/schizophrenic and they can find issues with even the best audio gear.  If you are looking for a good set of buds to use in everyday use that have great sound you really can't beat these.  My first pair of these I had for about year, and then I lost them.  I actually think I know where I left them but promised I would never go back... DAMN YOU NEBRASKA!  I just bought 2 more pairs and just got done making sure the they worked and thought to myself; "I have to review these, they deserve it.  Also, I need to teach Amazon a lesson for giving me an outlet to share my opinions."  I believe this is the first product I have ever reviewed on Amazon and if you have read this far you can probably see why.  I'm an idiot.<br/><br/>If you need ear buds... get these.  If you don't need ear buds get them. Hell, if you don't like them you are only out $6.  With almost two-thousand 5 star reviews, including this one, it's a pretty good sign that these are in fact good buds.  If you don't buy these it's a pretty good sign that you are in fact an idiot.  I would know, we can spot our own.<br/><br/>Yes, I have read the bad reviews, that's what I do.  I research a product to death and then look only at the bad reviews to see if the complaints really seem valid or sane. This may sometimes scare me away from perfectly good products like the Nokia N-Gage, HD-DVD, and reusable toilet paper.  But sometimes, especially with bigger purchases, I really want to feel sure after ordering the product, that I have made a huge disastrous mistake.  However, that being said, I have no idea what happened to some of the people that left bad reviews for these.  Maybe they got defective buds, or they are really picky audiophiles, but having heard them myself I can't agree with those reviews.  I also don't agree with the law of gravity or that 9/10 of the law involves possession.<br/><br/>I have also beat the hell out of my first pair of these buds.  I used them for everything, airplane, car rides, while I was cleaning around the house, and in the gym.  Occasionally I have used these as a leash for my dog, and in two instances these saved my life from demons, that live in my head.  Apparently head demons hate death metal, but absolutely love smooth jazz.  Strange, I know.  Seriously though, in the gym these things got ripped out of my ears a whole lot of times and they still kept working.  Like I said, in the end I lost the first pair, but they still worked great when I lost them.<br/><br/>I'll finish on a serious note and stop joking around for just a bit by saying this, at the end of the day everyone's hearing and preferences are different.  You can hate something that I love and vice versa.  That's just how it is.  So in the end there is no guarantee, but if you do the math and you even count the 3 star reviews as bad, only 19% of everyone that bought these did not like them.  The other 81% like me... nothing but love baby.  These things sound great, fit in my ear comfortably, they stay in my ear pretty good, even when I am at the gym, and seem pretty durable.<br/><br/>See, I told you could have saved a whole lot time if you would have just bought them, but you needed to keep reading.</span>

<blockquote><em><div class="a-row a-spacing-small review-data"><span class="a-size-base review-text review-text-content" data-hook="review-body">
<span>In just the past several years the difference between the least expensive IEM headphones (in-ear-monitor, or "earbud") and the "high-end," premium-priced models (some costing as much as $1000.00 and requiring special fitting by an audiologist) has been reduced to a degree sufficient to "fool" the most discerning listeners in a blind-fold test.  Of course, any failure to differentiate the "cheap" from the ultra-high end brand would immediately be blamed on numerous variables, which are likely to affect a listener's judgments about an "earbud"-sized phone more than is the case with full-sized headphones.  With IEM phones there are always questions about the size and materials of the ear-tips, and the particular "seal" that is achieved while listening.  Moreover, the judgment is always necessarily highly "subjective" and relative to listeners' personal tastes.  If it's not a blindfold test, the preference may come down to listeners' susceptibility to makers' promotional material, the added "designer-quality" features (including packaging), and lots of elitist hype supported by technological jargon based on physics and acoustic principles.<br/><br/>Oddly, listeners tend to disregard the source material and its limitations, regardless of the technology of the transducers (i.e. phones or speakers) used to reproduce the frequencies of the source material.  Yet, more often than not, the source material is compressed to the size of an mp3 file with a bit rate of 128 kbps as compared to a non-compressed WAV or AIFF file of 1411 kbps.  So unlike the high fidelity systems of the 1970s--AR3 vs. KLH "sealed" speakers vs. McIntosh and JBL combinations of woofers, mid-range drivers, and tweeters in a single gigantic cabinet--all designed to transmit the "non-compressed" signal embedded in the grooves of a long-playing record--the "stakes" in today's audio comparison/shoot-outs are far lower and less significant.  Instead of "which system can reproduce the full frequency spectrum?", the question has been reduced, merely, to which system sounds best while translating the limited information of an MP3 file into sound that is most pleasing to the perception of the listener?<br/><br/>With practice and with certain types of music that has been recorded by certain engineers, I'm now able to distinguish between Apple Lossless compression (files of 768 kbps) and common MP3 files (128 Kbps), but the perceived difference is neither habit-forming nor behavior- changing.  I'm still inclined to go with whatever "sounds best" to my ears.  Invariably, I'm impressed by the phones or speakers that, to my sensibilities, best represent the "sounds in nature," ie., the actual, pure and non-distorted, non-altered sounds of instruments recorded individually and in ensemble contexts as well as the complete range of the male and female human singing voice.  But when listening to an engineer like Rudy Van Gelder, who distorts the sound of the piano and enhances the sound of horns to offer the listener clearest access to all of the instruments being recorded, the headphones or speakers can do little to rectify the imbalances found in the source material.  It's when listening to the engineers who recorded "Kind of Blue" at Columbia Records or to the recordings of Roy Dunann for Contemporary Records that my ears perceive the truest, most "natural," deepest and most complex sound of an instrument, or instruments, or the human voice--IN SPACE.  Without regard to "context" (or what some listeners refer to as "ambiance") there is no longer a standard of reference, or a "sound in nature," which necessarily will have 3-dimensional realism, or depth.  Instead, the sound is manufactured and altered long before being picked up by various amplifying speakers in earphones, headphones, or elaborate speaker systems.<br/><br/>In the case of these Panasonic phones (costing $5) and the Sony phones (costing $10--though there are times when the prices are reversed, depending upon matters such as color and supply-demand), the consumer can be prepared to hear full-fidelity music, with clear reproduction of textures and pitches, from the double bass through the piano (and its overtones) through a percussion kit (including bass drum, snares, crash and ride cymbals, and the hi-hat's "chic chic" sound on the off-beats), to the human voice itself (in this instance, Roberta Gambarini's).<br/><br/>I compared the two phones with each other as well as with phones in the $50-$100 area (Sony MDR-EX300LP, Altec Titanium Backbeat UHP326) and phones in the $200 area (Sony MDR-EX700LP).  I suspect that the latter phones not only "wear longer" (due to better construction, thicker cords, etc.) but "wear better" (I can listen to music for several hours without any sense of discomfort or mounting pressure in the ear).  But as far as initial impressions go, the sonic differences are too small (and subjective) to be worthy of mention. The Sony phones are very slightly smaller and more lightweight, which may account for my sense that the music I was hearing from the Panasonics had fuller textures and more body, especially in the mid-range.  To put it differently: with the Sony phones I was hearing music played with stunning, pristine clarity while standing at the BACK of the music room;  with the Pansonic phones, I was down front, practically a hostage to the crack of the drummer's sticks, the pedaled overtones of the piano, the bassist's articulation of the strings (not merely the bass's tones).  Very likely, the same effect could be achieved with the Sony phones by using smaller ear tips (for a tighter seal) and turning up the gain (the Panasonic earphones are a trifle more "efficient"--i.e. sensitive--than the Sony phones, which require turning up the volume to reproduce the same resonating textures.  The Panasonics use a special, "ergonomic" angle along with an "angular" tip that ensures deeper insertion of the tip into the ear canal, thus accounting for some of the added "body" I was hearing in the sounds of the instruments and vocals.  Some listeners many prefer the more conventional ear tips of the Sony phones.  (Both phones provide two additional sets of tips, which are, in both cases, constructed with a stiff center, along the lines of Sony's acclaimed "hybrid silicone ear-tips").<br/><br/>I'd recommend ordering these Panasonic phones for $5-6.  If you like them, order another set before they wear out and the price goes up.  If you don't, order the Sony phones and keep the Panasonics on hand for the inevitable day that they fail (providing you don't accidentally step on them first).<br/><br/>[Ignore the aficionados' advice to "burn in" the phones, even before wearing them.  Even with high-end, costly phones, that's merely reducing the average lifetime of the phones for listening.  Moreover, either of these ultra low-priced Panasonic or Sony phones is ready to go into action from the moment you extract a pair from the box.  (Feel free to ignore the crumpled up instructions and warranty.)]</span>

<span>I have a self appointed mission of finding inexpensive headphones that sound better than average. I have been on this quest for years as I am always never without my mp3 player or radio.  I am rough on headphones and go through them fairly regularly.  So I am always trying to find inexpensive headphones that sound better than my previous set (Skullcandy Ink'd).  This time, after carefully reading reviews, I purchased 3 different headphones at once, all in the same price range (Under $15.00): The Panasonic RP-HJE120-A (Blue), The Skullcandy Jib, and The 2XL Spoke (Bounty Hunter Collection).<br/><br/>My conclusions were that the 2XL Spoke were adequate, but a distant third place. While the 2XL had definitively better bass than the Skullcandy Ink'd, the 2XL's mids and highs were only adequate.  The Skullcandy Jib completely blew the Scullcandy Ink'd away, with much better bass, mids and highs, I thought I found what I had been looking for, that my quest had ended.  But there was still the Panasonic RP-HJE120 to listen to.  I must say I had little expectation for these after listening to the Skullcandy Jib's.  But what was this?  Immediately the Panasonic's sounded impressive.  After listening to them for a while, I listened to the Jib's again.  I honestly preferred the cleaner sound of the Panasonic RP-HJE120, and the Ergo design was a plus, the fit was just so comfortable.<br/><br/>So there you have my layman's evaluation of these three headsets and my hands down recommendation for the Panasonic RP-HJE120 (I got the Blue, however, I very much doubt that your color choice will affect the sound).<br/><br/>I hope this helped.</span>

<span>My partner does not watch TV or listen to music very often. I, on the other hand, watch or listen, every waking hour! Wired buds had me tethered to my desk. I hoped wireless would free me and prevent a frying pan coming down on my skull! These did the trick. After a not-so-steep learning curve, there has, for the most part, been peace in the home.

<span>Quite possibly one of the best sounding earbuds under $20. Sound quality on par with those $30-$50+. With a coupon it drops to $15. An insane deal. These are genuine Ugreen branded merch. I bought these because I trust the brand for usb cables. Although not THE BEST for sound, the 5.8mm driver does a more than decent job with equalizer. I've been also been able to use it at a sitting for more than 8 hrs. That's extraordinary for $15.<br/><br/>I don't know of any manufacturer that can provide this level of quality to the public at this price. A Sony will cost you upwards to $68+ and that's with sub-par sound quality and push button control. Push button. We still in the 90s here. The Ugreen is touch control. $15. Only a manufacturer from China can make this happen. I do not appreciate the animosity towards the country as a whole. In my work we have suppliers globally. We do not fault them if their price is high or so forth. They are our suppliers, we treat them with dignity and respect. If we don't like them we just don't buy from them. We do not threa ten them in any way. Try getting this quality at this price from Emerson, Westinghouse, or Sony - oh wait, you can't.</span>

<span>*Long Review*<br/>I got these headphones during the Prime Early sale so they were about $75-50 less than normal price for new ones. I’ll list some pros and cons below but my immediate reaction to wearing and using these headphones is that they are really no different than the in ear air pods pro. Only reason I wanted these is because I don’t like working out in the AirPods personally and use it mainly for work. I had the older over ear Powerbeats before I got these.<br/><br/>Pros:<br/>- Noise cancellation is pretty solid even in a loud gym.<br/>- Overall sound and base is also a lot better than I would have expected compared to the older beats.<br/>- Stay in the ear pretty nicely during cardio or frequent movements.<br/>- Battery appears to be pretty solid with the charging case.<br/>- Case is smaller than past models and similar to AirPod size so it’s easy to fit in pockets (con to this coming though).<br/>- Connecting to iPhone is simple and takes less than a minute.<br/><br/>Cons:<br/>- THEY MAKE YOU BUY A LIGHTNING CHARGING BASE!! Will admit, I didn’t look deep into that because I assumed it was the same as the AirPods and older beats. You cannot use the older Apple charging cords and you have to use Apples newer lighting chargers/cords because the older cords won’t fit into the charging case. It does come with the cord at least but without the right base, the cord is pointless!<br/>- As other reviews have said, the case is pretty terrible as it comes to durability and feel. It feels so flimsy that you could easily snap it off or if it’s dropped, it would break.<br/>- Unlike other brands wing tip in ear headphones (Bose), it doesn’t have different sizing so it may hurt your ears (fits perfectly for me though). The different buds don’t really matter if the wing tip hurts your ear. Big miss by apple/beats to not include that because I could see that being super annoying to others.<br/>- To put the buds in, it’s pretty hard not to hit the headphone button that starts/stops music or answer/end a call so that’s kind of annoying.<br/>- At full MSRP ~$225, it is pretty pricey for what you get.<br/>- Probably not the most comfortable for long periods of time. (Beyond 1.5-2 hours)<br/><br/>All in all, I do like the headphones because they fit my ear nicely and I like the noise cancellation/sound of them so I plan to keep them. I will say at full MSRP, I would probably look at other brands for in ear wing tipped and not get these though. (I know I just contradicted myself!) The reason I say that, is because there are probably better or more comfortable headphones for over $200 and I got these on sale for Prime Day at a big discount (~$150). Plus if you have to buy a new charging base, you’re adding another $10-20 to the price tag. I can’t speak for other brands and how they work their charging cases or cords when you buy them but Apple definitely gets you there. Like my title says, these are good headphones but not great and would have expected a bit more from apple. Hope this helps!</span>

<span>I love so much about these little earbuds. They connect seamlessly to all of my apple devices. The phone calls are very clear both ways, for me and the person I'm calling. The sound quality is incredible. I first tried the Studio Buds, but they would fall out of my ear too easily. If I smiled, laughed, if I ate anything, moved my jaw at all, they would start to slip out of my ears. So, I liked the idea of these Beat Fit Pros because of the wing tips. Seemed like it would be more secure in my ear, and it really is. Now, the problem is that the wing tips really hurt my ear after wearing them for even 10-15 minutes. My ear was literally red from how sore that little piece of rubber/silicone. I went for a pair of the Raycon earbuds with the little wing tips instead, and they fit SO MUCH BETTER. The are the perfect fit and they don't fall out, but the technology is nothing even close to Beats. I'm so torn, because I want to love my Beats earbuds, but they are extremely uncomfortable to wear for any length of time. Perhaps I should try the buds with the wrap-around-the-ear thing...? I just don't like how those ones look, and I'm afraid they'll be much more noticeable wrapping all the way around my ear like that. Or maybe these wing tips will soften up over time...? Conundrum.</span>

<span>I bought these earbuds along with 4 other pairs, with the intent of comparing them over a couple weeks and returning all but my favorite.  Here were the results:<br/><br/>Beats Fit Pro - https://www.amazon.com/dp/B09JL65GNM?psc=1&amp;ref=ppx_yo2ov_dt_b_product_details<br/>Pros – These buds had some great base, and the wingtip gave them a fit that made them refuse to fall out of my ears.  But the best feature?  Physical “clicky” buttons on each one of the buds.  You press in and hear/feel the click, rather than relying on a touchscreen-like feature.  No need to guess if you tapped them once or twice, you will know.<br/>Cons – The wingtip gives a very sturdy fit, but not the most comfortable. I wouldn’t recommend to anyone with smaller ears.  The noise canceling was solid, but nothing special.  And this may be picky, but I didn’t care for most of the color schemes available.  I prefer my earbuds to be hard to notice, and even the black ones have a bright red letter “b” in the middle.<br/><br/>Beats Studio Buds - https://www.amazon.com/dp/B096SV8SJG?psc=1&amp;ref=ppx_yo2ov_dt_b_product_details<br/>Pros – Very comfortable with the same great physically “clicky” buttons as the Beats Fit Pro.  Noise canceling seemed slightly better than average.  Great base.  Classic look.<br/>Cons – Tested during a workout, a little bit of sweat had these sliding right out of my ear.  The case for these earbuds also was the flimsiest of any I had tested, with a very weak hinge that I was scared of breaking off within the 2 weeks of using.<br/><br/>Samsung Galaxy Buds Pro - https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08MWZHHKP?psc=1&amp;ref=ppx_yo2ov_dt_b_product_details<br/>Pros – A neat feature that I noticed only in these earbuds was that it had noise amplification as well as noise cancelation.  With one swipe in the app, the surrounding sound was actually louder and clearer than it would be without the earbuds in.  Great if you are hard of hearing, or just enjoy snooping on conversations out of reach.<br/>Cons – Similar to the Beats Studio Buds, these didn’t stay in during a workout.  They were usable, but every 10 minutes I found myself pushing them back into my ear.  And this is an opinion, but these are the ugliest earbuds out of the bunch.  The shiny black gleam made it look like a large beetle was hanging out in my ear.  No visible brand placement either, which makes them appear cheap and generic rather than the quality Samsung they are.<br/><br/>Samsung Galaxy Buds Live - https://www.amazon.com/dp/B09TBM1L3S?psc=1&amp;ref=ppx_yo2ov_dt_b_product_details<br/>Pros – Cost effective!  I added these to the test group because of the unique shape, and for that they are worth giving a try.  If you have small ears and do not like the rubber insert that is standard in most other earbuds, these may be perfect for you.<br/>Cons – Poor fit for large ears.  These were tested the least of all of the buds, because the fit was so bad for my ear shape that they wouldn’t stay in if I turned my head too fast.<br/><br/>Bose QuietComfort  - https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08C4KWM9T?psc=1&amp;ref=ppx_yo2ov_dt_b_product_details<br/>Pros – Bose noise canceling is unmatched.  If your primary use for earbuds is to cancel out that background white noise, this is the pair for you.  The sound quality is great, not too heavy on the base.  The case for the earbuds stood out from the rest as the only one that impressed me.  Felt very study, and I had no worries tossing it into a gym bag or cup holder.  The only case with a button latch to make sure it doesn’t open accidentally.<br/>Cons – This was the most expensive pair of earbuds by a longshot, and there were still some things I felt could be improved.  The rubber inserts had more of a “flayed” shape rather than the “rounded” shape that is standard.  My guess is that this was by design, because the earbuds were also slightly heavier than others and may need that extra in-ear grip.  The flayed shape did make them sturdier, but at the cost of them being uncomfortable in an active situation.  They were also the largest earbuds, and stuck out from the side of my head further than I would have liked.<br/><br/>My favorite?  The beats fit pro!  While I wouldn’t recommend this pair for everyone, it was perfect for my routine.  My music taste benefits from the boosted base, and the wingtip shape was perfect for any workouts.  The feature that really convinced me was the physical buttons, something that I didn’t realize how desperately I needed.</span>

<span>I am a long-time user of the Bose QuietComfort 20 Acoustic Noise Cancelling Headphones. These are my favorite noise cancelling option to use while taking walks. I like to listen to audio books while walking and the QuietComfort 20 are superb for this use. I also like to use a noise cancelling option while listening to audio books and podcasts in the car, especially because my car does not contain road noise well. I decided I would like to have a second QuietComfort 20 reserved for use in my car. An additional advantage to having a second one is if anything happens to the one I walk with, I'll have a backup. But, unfortunately, Bose discontinued the QuietComfort 20 forcing me to have to find another option for use in the car.<br/><br/>I first purchased the wireless Bose QuietComfort Earbuds. But I found much to dislike about them. They feel heavy in the ears; the buds themselves just feel heavier and less comfortable than the QuietComfort 20 Headphones. I also disliked that every time I put the Bose QuietComfort Earbuds into my ears they speak to me telling me they are trying to connect to my device and also reporting battery state. I found this incredibly annoying. Another thing I hugely disliked was that there is an uncomfortable "boom boom" sensation as I walk with them in. I wear Vibram FiveFinger shoes and do not walk with a heavy gait. I do not get this "boom boom" sensation when walking with the QuietComfort 20 headphones. I also disliked how big the Bose QuietComfort Earbuds' case was. I disliked how the Bose QuietComfort Earbuds sometimes felt like they weren't secure in my ears and when I would try to adjust their stability I would accidentally change the noise cancellation setting. On two occasions, an uncomfortable high pitched sound emitted from one of the buds; it only lasted for a couple seconds but it was annoying. I tried using the Bose QuietComfort Earbuds for a month and never could bring myself to like them, so I returned them. I now have a strong dislike for Bose, primarily because they discontinued my beloved QuietComfort 20 Headphones. But up until recently, I was a huge Bose fan.<br/><br/>I purchased Apple AirPods Pro. I immediately fell in love with the H1 chip operation. But I didn't like the color white. I also didn't like the stalk that extends down. But I started using them thinking I had found my noise cancelling option for the car. And although the AirPods Pro delivered some "boom boom" sensation while walking, it was much much better than the Bose QuietComfort Earbuds. Then I started to become aware of a huge problem with the AirPods Pro. They would not stay in my ears. I would place them in ear, hear the noise cancellation activate and then in time the noise cancellation would turn off because one of the pods had pushed out of my ear enough to cause the noise cancellation function to disengage. I found myself constantly having to push them into my ear in an effort to keep them from pushing out. A couple times they plain fell out of my ears. I consulted instructionals on how to properly insert them into my ears for proper fit. I also did the fit test and passed the test indicating I had good seal. Only the seal wouldn't last and the pods would eventually push out of my ears. So I had to return the AirPods Pro because they wouldn't stay in my ears.<br/><br/>I purchased some non noise cancelling earbuds thinking that a passive seal would be enough, but I found a number of problems with this option. I didn't like shoving thing way into my ear. Not only was it a little uncomfortable, but I also wondered about the sanitariness of touching (e.g., foam inserts) prior to shoving them into my ear. Maybe this could lead to ear infection? Also, the amount of sound isolation was too good which diminished my situational awareness while walking and/or driving. So passive noise block earbuds weren't solving my use need.<br/><br/>I was worried there was no option for the car and I would not have a backup to my beloved QuietComfort 20 headphones. I really wish I could buy another pair of QuietComfort 20 headphones just to have a backup for the future. After delaying and delaying, I decided to go to the trouble to try one last option for the car: the Beats Fit Pro. Eureka!<br/><br/>The Beats Fit Pro are fantastic! They have the H1 chip, which is awesome. They fit and feel way better than the Bose QuietComfort Earbuds and are super secure in my ears, unlike the AirPods Pro. The Beats Fit Pro feel so light to wear. I can wear them all day and there is no discomfort. They also have a button to cycle through the noise cancellation options, which I like a lot better than the tapping that was needed on the Bose QuietComfort Earbuds. I also like the button press on the Beats Fit Pro better than the stalk-squeeze on the AirPods Pro.<br/><br/>The one edge that I might say the Bose QuietComfort Earbuds have over the others is the noise cancellation. The Bose QuietComfort Earbuds arguably provide more intense noise cancellation that results in more of a bass presence and a sense that the content being played is closer to you. However, there is a cost to this that I don't think is worth it. The biggest cost for me was the "boom boom" sensation while walking. I don't know exactly what is to blame for this but it completely ruins the earbuds for what I want to use them for. I found the fit and noise cancellation of the Beats Fit Pro to be better suited to my needs.<br/><br/>I wrote this to help others in their quest to find the earbuds that work best for them. I strongly recommend giving the Beats Fit Pro a try. I like them a lot. I think many others will too.</span>

<span>Getting this out of the way at the beginning: every person has slightly different ear canals, so what fits me well won't fit everybody as well. If you're interested in these but aren't sure about fit, they do have a free return policy.<br/><br/>I use these paired to a Pixel 6 daily on long walks/hikes as well as in the house when I'm trying to focus on my work and tune out family/neighbors/air conditioner etc. Even though the Pixel app told me to adjust for better fit, the degree of noise cancellation is better than anything I've experienced short of a set of $450 over-the-ear cans. I customized the controls so a long press on the left earbud switches between noise cancellation and transparent mode - the latter is only so-so but good enough for checking out groceries or saying hi to people you're passing by on a walk.<br/><br/>Each earbud has a mic and people I'm talking to in a call can hear me just fine. The case has a battery of its own so you can charge up the earbuds without having to plug anything in, and also the case supports wireless charging.<br/><br/>Pixel integration is, as one would hope to expect, excellent. The tutorials and walkthroughs are very helpful.<br/><br/>My main issue with these is unreliable touch detection. Sometimes I'm trying to pause music and the earbud reads my tap as a drag (increases/decreases volume) and vice-versa. Hopefully they do a firmware update to help with that. It's a pretty minor issue.</span>

<span>The features on this tws iem are the best in class:<br/><br/>-Skin-touch controls so you're not accidentally pressing with pillows, or having to push hard on your ears. The controls are definitely the best of any tws I've ever used, and this should be the new standard in the industry. Swipe for volume, tap for calls/play, double tap for skip/hang up, and long press to swap between anc/transparency.<br/><br/>-"Hello Google" works better on these than any other tws I've used, for whatever reason.<br/><br/>-Switch only between anc and transparency modes, so you don't need to wait for slow transitions.<br/><br/>-Ultra lightweight, has no mass so it can't ever gain momentum to fall out of your ears. Plus, extremely comfortable.<br/><br/>-Great battery life compared to others. At the start of my 10hr work day to the end I only need to put them in the charging case for about 5 minutes one time. They recharge FAST.<br/><br/>-Strong signal never has dicey connection. I can go about 60 feet away from my phone with these and not lose signal at all. (Any other tws bud is like 10feet.)<br/><br/>The ANC and transparency modes-<br/>The ANC is interesting, because they're a pretty "open" iem so when the battery is dead they let in a lot of the world around you.. but they do a good job canceling noise coming in regardless of low passive isolation. It's usually not as good as a strong earplug, or an ear protection over an iem, but it is still extremely nice.<br/>It tends to drown out only the low end of some sounds, like if a white noise is playing you'll still hear all of the high pitch portion. This kind of makes sounds more annoying sometimes rather than making them less annoying even when they're overall lower volume.<br/><br/>Transparency mode is super nice, but it doesn't allow you to change the strength of this mode as some other manufacturers do. Google did a good job making it sound natural but without volume control it doesn't do a good enough job of allowing you to hear as well as without them in. Things are still just slightly too quiet with this mode on.<br/><br/>Mic and call quality, BT delays-<br/>The mics sound fantastic. Listening back to myself sounds incredible. Hardly any compression. Still picks up lots of outside noise but not as bad as most tws.<br/>Despite the amazing microphone(s), calls have the nefariously annoying delay. Both when you hear someone and when you speak. Enough to where people notice..<br/><br/>This delay is also present when gaming and watching videos. YouTube and major video players will add a delay to synch it and it works great but in competitive games it's really bad.<br/><br/>So, even though the BT signal is super strong (and the AAC is a lot less battery intensive! Which is probably the reason they chose it.) If you need a FAST signal then you have to look elsewhere.<br/><br/>Luckily, most of us don't actually need a fast signal and I'd 100% take this minor delay over increased battery usage.<br/><br/>There's a lot more about the features I could say, but in short I love them. If you're just looking for something light and comfortable (seriously, way way way more comfortable than any other tws out there! Very easy to sleep in and wear all day compared to others!) Then these are great..<br/><br/>But.. I must now talk about something very important, and the reason they lose two stars despite all the love I have for them: Sound quality.<br/><br/>GOOGLE YOU NEED TO FIRE SOMEONE OVER THIS. Holy biscuits, talk about some of the worst sounding iems above $30 I've ever heard (I've had a couple hundred..)<br/><br/>There are no highs. These are what is known as "dark." Anything above 10khz is bland sounding.. so anything fun frequency, or with distortion, or anything.. just sounds bad.<br/><br/>They sound okay at first because the bass and mids are alright but there is no balance when you get to the highs. They absolutely ruin any electronic or  post 80's rock. I'd take most gas station buds over these for technical listening.<br/><br/>But, I think that's what Google was going for: a vocal-centric bud for daily function over musical quality.<br/><br/>They nailed the spatial side of audio; the driver placement is perfect for diffuse field and phase generation. And there is even a nice dynamic feeling from bass on the weighty driver.<br/><br/>If only the driver had a bit stronger magnet so it could move a little faster, or maybe it literally just needed to be tuned better.. it's just bad at making high frequency sounds and it totally ruins all critical music listening.<br/><br/>So, overall, I love the set for work. Audiobooks/podcasts/calls/battery/controls/comfort are all top notch 10/10.<br/>But what the heck was Google thinking releasing it with such horrible tuning? Give me 20 minutes with their tuner and they'd have a top of the line product here. It's disgusting what they've done..<br/><br/>Maybe they don't think people actually care about the sound of their music. And honestly, they're probably right.</span>

<span>I've been a pixel user since the Pixel 3a and really love the google brand. At that time, I wanted to get all the google products so that my pixel could work flawlessly across my tech. I bought the original pixel buds in 2020 but had to return them because the "wings" hurt my ears too much; I have relatively small ears and the design of the wings was uncomfortable. So, when I heard the news that google got rid of the wings for this version, I was really excited. While comfort has improved for this model, I still find that they are still slightly uncomfortable with the tips. As to date, the best earphones for my ears are the classic airpods. I had to give these a 4/5 because of their comfort. I am still debating whether or not I will return these.<br/><br/>EDIT 10/3: I bought the comply premium foam tips for buds and that helped significantly. 4/5 rating still stands, but I can wear for a few hours now before my ears get tired.</span>

<span>So far these have been perfect. They pair quickly to my pixel 6, which swaps the audio output seamlessly.<br/>Noise cancelling is solid, the transparency mode is a little annoying unless you're somewhere relatively quiet (things like fans, cars, wind get amplified and played back in a kind of irritating way.) I find just using one earbud is the way to go if you're somewhere you expect to need to talk to people or hear your surroundings.<br/><br/>I really appreciate that the case of these doesn't fly open if you drop it.</span>

<span>I give these Airpods a 5/5 stars because they are excellent :) They have a very long battery life and they are actually noise canceling, even with one Airpod in your ear. I had Airpod Pros before I brought these but lost them back in February, and I actually like these better than the Pros because they don’t feel heavy in your ear. Airpod Pros are smaller than these, so they’re more likely to fall out your ear. With these, they stay in your ear without feeling so heavy, and won’t have to worry about them falling out! Only downside I have about these Airpods are that after about 2 months, my left Airpod sounded a little low. But that’s nothing a little setting adjusting won’t fix :) Overall these are excellent headphones!</span>

<span>I recently bought these last month and after a month of usage I find this product to be very well designed. But I think personally there are still some design flaws.<br/><br/>1. You can't wear it very long<br/>- After a certain point maybe after 2 hours, you ears start to hurt especially if your playing loud music or something.<br/>-The battery on these earphones aren't the best either 4 hours are the longest they've ever lasted after a full night's charge too 100%<br/><br/>2. This is not an honest product<br/>- I live in New York City, a very loud place, so when I see noise canceling, I want to be able to not hear the noises on the train on my commutes to work, school and home. So in terms of noise canceling, I don't think this product is very honest.<br/><br/>But otherwise the product is great, the sound quality is great (unless your on a call at the same time), the case doesn't need to be charged to often, it's very good if you need a quality wireless earphone.</span>

<span>Whenever I see something with a 4-star review, it usually means it’s a solid product but there’s something (or somethings) keeping it out of 5-star range.<br/><br/>For me, these are a perfect example of that. They’re small (good), not terribly obtrusive (only some out-of-ear-stick-out, tho your experience may vary), the sound has some solid bass which is helpful for the gym (where I tested these out), the sound overall is clear (download some equalizer apps to play with the sound itself), and they stayed in my ear well. I don’t know much about soundstage or whatever, but the sound itself is clear, bass is nice and strong, and you can hear even the subtle nuances like the shifting of a hand on guitar strings clearly enough without being disturbed. That, to me, is the sign of a good earbud.<br/><br/>The transparency mode and noise canceling modes were alright. But that’s just it, they’re alright. Granted, the AirPod Pros have a higher price tag, so they do the ANC and Transparency mode much better. So it’s understandable that these would do the same, but on just the slightest bit of a lower level.<br/><br/>I’m also spoiled bc the Airpod Pros have wireless charging. These DO have USB C, but the lack of wireless charging is a small thing, really. There’s something about being able to toss these on a charging pad and leaving them there to charge that’s just so satisfying. Also, was not a fan of how the case just doesn’t have that “premium” feel. The matte finish is nice, tho I would have liked a little more weight in the case lid, but at this point, these are such little (and I mean LITTLE) things that really, it’s not a dealbreaker.<br/><br/>My only thing is the amount they stick out. I’m sorry, but they do look a little…funny, the way they sort of stick out just a bit so that the “b” logo is upright. They don’t stick out a LOT, but juuuuust enough that when you look in the mirror, you’ll see a vertical line where the physical button (which I have managed to press on accident a couple of times while adjusting the bud) sticks out. Also, I had a little difficulty getting them to stay in, but that’s beyond pretty much anyone’s control.<br/><br/>These get that 4th star because of just how they are a solid enough product worth the purchase. They don’t do any one thing particularly well, but there are just enough teeny things for me that I wouldn’t say these are the best I’ve ever used. (For comparison, the Jabra 75t gets the equivalent of a 4.3 rating…the hear-through is amazing and their app really helps boost functionality).<br/><br/>For me, these are SOLID gym earbuds. They play music loudly, clearly enough, and the bass is strong enough for me that I can drown out whatever annoying other music is playing outside. They fit and stay relatively well. For the price tag, you get some good bang for the buck. You could do worse, but at this range, depending on if you want to pitch in a few more, you could also do better.</span>

<span>After losing my apple AirPods I was very disheartened to have to spend 300 bucks on another pair. That’s when I went out and searched for something comparable and found these. After using them for several month I have overall positive feelings about them however their is many things the future consumers of this product should know.<br/><br/>Pros:<br/>To start the price point on these is much more affordable than the airpod pros. The wireless works well and I have not had any range issues with them or issues with them randomly cutting off or disconnecting. The noise cancellation is solid but not perfect. It does it job but it does give me a fish bowl feeling when NC is turned on. The battery life is also amazing. I believe they are rated for 8 hours and I can say I can get around 6 hours out of them before the low power beep comes on.<br/><br/>Cons:<br/>With the benefit of its low price point, some corners were definitely cut. Let’s start with the spacial audio. It’s not vary clear and when turned on it fails to compare to the air pods pro, where you can literally forget you have headphones in. Secondly the microphone on these is very bad. It sounds like you’re talking through a two way radio. And finally my biggest gripe with these is that in certain situations they emit a very loud high pitched squeal. If I am holding one headphone in my hand, and close my hand, the headphone almost sounds like it has feedback and this isn’t a little it’s loud. Loud enough to hear across the room. I can also recreate this when closing the lid to my case. If I close it to slowly the feedback screech happens almost every time. I worry that this is causing damage to my headphones but I don’t know.<br/><br/>Overall I think these are great for the price but have issues and if you have the funds, go buy a pair of galaxy buds or air pod pros.</span>

<span>I bought these after initially buying and returning the ‘beats pro fit’ which advertised basically everything these do with the addition of the silicon piece to better secure the earbuds in your ear.<br/><br/>I returned those because that piece made them uncomfortable to wear for more than half an hour or so but their sound quality and especially their noise cancellation were phenomenal—they sounded a bit better than these do. Not by an extremely large margin but especially in regards to the active noise cancellation, the Pro Fit did it better and I’m not sure why since they’re nearly the same product but perhaps they have more differences internally than I realized.<br/><br/>I’m tempted to return these and re-order the Pro Fit and just trying to find a way to make them tolerable to wear because I miss the level of noise cancellation they achieved.<br/><br/>Alas, these are still great earbuds and I’ll need more time with them to make the decision of whether or not to keep them. From only a day’s use I can say that they’re far more comfortable to wear for extended periods and the charging case they come with is of better quality than that of the Pro Fit’s (which isn’t saying too much to be fair).<br/><br/>I’ll update this after I’ve had a chance to use them at the gym a few times.</span>

<span>Unfortunately, Apple has redesigned their earbuds so that they are now even smaller than they used to be.  Already, with the old design, they were so small I had to cover each ear bud with a specially made silicone thingie (which are called “Lunies Apple Earpods Covers”), so that they’d stay in my ears.  Now with this new Apple design, the earpieces are so small that they fall out even with the silicone thingie on.  I’m knocking off 2 stars, because now they’re twice as annoying.<br/><br/>As usual, Apple’s packaging is amazing.  This might be a weird thing to notice or care about, but aesthetically it’s a pleasure to see such beautiful design.  If only they would take as much care in the product itself!  To me, the fact that they fall out is really a downer, because I use earbuds not just for phone calls but to listen to music while commuting.  The first day I used them, even with the silicone covers on, they fell out every few minutes.  I actually had to Jerry rig a second pair of silicone covers in order to get the damn buds to stay in.  (I use two covers per bud, now, but have to carefully trim the second cover so that it fits over the first.)  Obviously, it would be more desirable if I didn’t have to use any silicone covers in the first place.  But two?!  Do better, Apple, and I don’t mean by skimping on materials.</span>
