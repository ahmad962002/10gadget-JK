<span>Very pleasantly surprised. I needed a good quality camera on a budget and this one fits the bill perfectly! I started playing around and shooting after the battery fully charged. You will need to purchase an SD card, as one is not included. I am not a photographer, I actually bought this camera to record 4kHD videos of workouts/fitness content. After taking a few pictures, I am blown away by the quality and different settings. Manual is really awesome for fine tuning and really personalizing a shot. I may even get into photography once I get the hang of things!</span>

<span>Overall this is an excellent camera. It feels great in the hands and the zoom and image stabilizationis phenomenal. a few problems i have is that if youre shooting professionally, or even semi professionally, do not get it. The camera does have quite a few filter features which are each individually able to be customized as well. the only reason why i am giving the camera a 4 star rating is because i am a sucker for detail, and when cropping the images you do get a decent amout of grain, even with the ISO set for 100.  When you use the function for shooting in raw,there is alot of grain and discoleration when aking light and color adjustments, furthermore, you get alot of chromatic light abberations in your shots when using the zoom feature in sunlight. other than that it is a great camera. this camera is excellent if you just want to take memorable shots on a trip or vacation and it is very versatile as far as the functions it has. it is highly customizable which ia also a plus but at the same time does take some time to get used to. One really good feature this camera has is continuous 4k burst mode, but i highly recommend getting a high speed memory card due to the fact that if you dont, the camera will stop recording 5-10 shot inso the process. The vidio quality and sound quality is excellent on this camera, and if you enjoy taking video as well as shots, this is the camera to get. also, the screen swivels 180 degrees so it makes it easy to get shots above your head, or close to the groung in a crouched position. The camera also comes with a lense hood for blocking sunlight that might cause haze or light leaks in your shots. So to summerize, proffesionally, not a great camera to have, but if you just want something versatile and quick and easy to use that takes good quality shots and video for traveling etc, this is the camera to buy. I provided some example pictures above so you can see what it is capable of.</span>

<span>I purchased this camera after purchasing a Lumix FZ1000Mk2, to compare the two. The FZ300 was US$300 cheaper, and I wondered if I could get by with it instead of the FZ1000Mk2. I found the form factor to be a bit small for my larger hands, and didn't really care for the zoom control on the lens barrel. There have been some instances "in the wild" of the zoom lever surrounding the shutter release failing, so having a secondary zoom control is good, but this one seemed somewhat vague.<br/><br/>My background is a series of digital point and shoot cameras going back to the Agfa 1250. I've had perhaps 10-12 digital cameras since that time, culminating in the Sony Alpha 900, with a complete, and I mean complete, kit of Minolta lenses for that body. That said, I got to the point where dragging along a backpack of lenses and filters to be more than I wanted. My Lumix LX5 and LX7 languished in a drawer, the iPhone 10Xr had taken on more and more photography duties, but it in itself let me down on many occasions, especially in low light.<br/><br/>I ended up getting the Canon G5X Mk2 as a new pocket camera with a better zoom range than the LX7. What I needed along with that was a super-zoom bridge camera to take the place of the lenses I was giving up with the Sony A900, and the furthest reach I had with that kit was an f8 500mm reflector...<br/><br/>In the end, I found that neither the FZ300 or the FZ1000Mk2 really met my needs and settled on the FZ2500, which while still a very good camera for stills, has a more impressive video capability, even though that is secondary to my needs. The FZ2500 has a weight and size that feels better to me, the ergonomic feel more like a traditional interchangable lens camera, and it will record video only limited by battery and memory capacity.<br/><br/>The FZ300 is a VERY capable camera, and it is a favorite among people who shot birds. The 1/2.3" sensor gives it better optical zoom reach. In the end, I wanted the larger camera and a 1" sensor to match the Canon. so the FZ300 was returned along with the FZ1000Mk2.<br/><br/>That said, I did recommend the FZ300 to my son-in-law as a Christmas gift for my daughter, and I believe she will be happy with it. Indeed, I think for anyone wanting something that is a huge step up from a smart phone, in a fairly light package (600+ grams) with weather sealing will appreciate this camera. It simply wasn't right for me.</span>

<span>This camera is a great starter camera. I used it as my starter and it is amazing. The focus, 4K shots, nightime view, quality, and zoom is amazing if you're starting out. It produces great photos for a long time. The battery life could be longer but that doesn't take away from how amazing this camera has been for me. 5 Stars. 100% reccomend to starters and/or sports photographers</span>

<span>I  bought the FZ300 as a present for my wife. She loved the FZ150 she was using but found it's limitations discouraging. She didn't want my FZ200 and didn’t like the FZ1000 I bought her at first because it was too big and heavy . I ended up adding it to my camera collection (it's a great 5 star camera that I enjoy using and I highly recommend). The FZ300 is smaller and lighter than the FZ1000 and seemed like a good upgrade for her to use.<br/><br/>Before I gave my wife the camera I tested the camera out and was extremely impressed with the huge number of improvements in the camera over the FZ200. The FZ200 has the same lens and sensor as the FZ300 but the difference that the improved processor, much better EVF and touch screen, much better build quality, weather proofing make this camera a terrific buy. There are so many other features, neither of us has tried will make this camera useful for just about any occasion<br/><br/>She likes to use just the IA setting like many users and the FZ300 works just perfect in that setting. She used the camera on our just completed cruise and was so enthusiast about it's performance, I kept hearing , "I love this camera", . "I love this camera". . In viewing her images they were coming out sharp, detailed, and perfect exposure. We were both amazed that even the lower light indoors images and video showed great detail.  I set a 1600 ISO limit and images showed very good dynamic range, much better than the FZ200 I had used previously. The best features she liked were the beautiful bright sharp EVF, the fast accurate focus and the touch screen was a WOW, She also loved the many extra features. She found the handling superb. It does feel great in the hand and the new styling matches the newer Panasonic cameras. The menus are easy and the super control panel seen on expensive cameras is terrific. You can quickly adjust any setting on the LCD without going through extensive menus like most cameras. The touch focus on the LCD screen is also a great feature. Macro images are also much easier to take and look great.<br/><br/>Some really great points and extra features that make the camera very special<br/><br/>1.  The camera has an excellent grip, it  feels good in the hands. Easy to use.<br/>2.  Very good camera build, feels more solid than the excellent FZ200<br/>3.  Camera has weather sealing and can be used in inclement weather. Not waterproof!<br/>4.  Great zoom range. From 25 to 600<br/>5.  EVF is larger and improved over FZ200 and can view scenes and info better<br/>6.  Touchscreen LCD is a great improvement which allows easier use of camera<br/>7.  Can set the focus point while viewing through EVF, focus area, extra functions buttons.<br/>8.  Constant F2.8 aperture throughout the entire zoom area. Allows more light, better low light<br/>9.  Has mechanical shutter (quiet) and electronic shutter (noise free) great in museums<br/>10. Extremely fast focus, much improved over the FZ200. Depth from defocus process?<br/>11. 4K photos, 30FPS images come out 8mp, can easily select perfect photo on LCD<br/>12. 4K video now possible. Carefully done and results are excellent.<br/>13. Camera appears very fast. Fast startup and ready to use.<br/>14. Microphone port allows adding external Microphone. Useful when windy conditions.<br/>15. Improved low light images even with the small sensor. Up to 1600 with some noise<br/>16. Camera while small dSLR sized is fairly light even with the big zoom lens.<br/>17. Can easily add filters, including Polarizers, ND filters and super closeup filters<br/>18. Includes a very good lens hood that can protect the lens without adding a UV filter<br/>19. Image quality is excellent in good light, shows good dynamic range and lots of detail.<br/>20. Wifi allows easy transfer of images. And camera control through app.<br/>21. Images and video overall is excellent with lots of keepers.<br/>22. F2.8 constant aperture lens allows improved Bokeh (background blur not usually possible with small sensor.). Mostly seen in macro images.<br/>23. Good quality macro images possible.<br/><br/>What isn’t so great with this excellent camera and could be improved.<br/><br/>1. Camera uses a very small sensor, so low light images and video are limited<br/>2. Small sensor has lower dynamic range and less detail in images.<br/>3. Could use a headphone jack for video.<br/>4. Missing extra wide angle because of fixed lens.<br/>5. Not pocket able, so camera needs a bag or strap.<br/>6. Low light images and video while tops for small sensor are still limited and can be noisy.<br/>7. Lens is integrated in camera so you really can’t change the lens.<br/>8. Camera is not inexpensive but considering all the features, it’s a good buy.<br/><br/>If you love super zoom cameras or you are a birder, this is a must buy. It won't replace the FZ1000 which has a much larger 1 inch sensor with better image quality, better low light quality and better dynamic range. But the FZ300 is a true super zoom; it stands in a class all it's own and it is well worth upgrading if you have a FZ150/FZ200 or other older Canon or Nikon super zoom. Right now as of 2016, it's the best small sensor super zoom you can buy. If the camera seems too big or expensive for you,  consider the Panasonic ZS50 which is a great pocket super zoom with an EVF or the new ZS100 which now has a 1 inch sensor and touchscreen EVF..but costs more than the FZ300..</span>

<span>I'm one of those photographers who while on a budget still likes to have toys to play with. This camera is one of those many toys I've purchased over the years. It was never intended to be a daily shooter for me just something I took out on occasion to take some pictures with for fun. Like, for instance, the train yard not far from my house is a fave place to go take pics. The tracks that lead to them and yard itself provide some fantastic opportunities. Lots of great shots. It actually does perform quite well and I was pleased at the quality of the resulting pictures.<br/><br/>But there is one major drawback and that's the processing time between shots. And if you're the type of person who wants to take that next shot immediately this is not your camera. I used it in sport mode the time at the yards so I'd get get between 3 and 5 shots per click of the shutter. And the downtime between shots is anywhere between 5 to 20 seconds. So you get this spot on shot of a bird sitting on the caboose and then want to get a shot of the bird closer up you'll be waiting for a few moments. Which will likely mean the opportunity is gone by the time the camera is ready again. This makes it nearly impossible to use in a setting such as sports where you have to be ready at all times.<br/><br/>That aside the pictures you get are pretty great. The zoom is fantastic (especially with a tripod) and will get you close to places that you normally can't get too. I'd say it's definitely worth the money. I'm very pleased with the purchase overall. But definitely upgrade the included memory card.</span>

<span>I got the camera because I am tired of carrying extra lenses and flash units etc. and I am not disappointed! The camera is easy to use and has a lot of features including a great zoom. The only down side is the flash it seems to be less distance than many other cameras with a small flash.  I have used it to take portraits and some nature shots with the zoom and they look great.</span>

<span>Pros:<br/>The zoom is truly awesome in this.  No SLR lens can compare.  It's great for birdwatching, zooming in on a face in the crowd, wildlife shots, and even just cool stuff that's a long way away.<br/>4k video is great.  I'm a Canon SLR person and they don't have 4k in the low or mid-range for an SLR, so that's why I got this and it is great.<br/>Fast FPS.  The camera can take 4k video, which is 8mp at 30fps.  It claims it will do it in 4k Burst mode, which really means it takes a 4k video and will show you frame by frame and let you select ones to make photos.  Horrible to do on the camera's screen, I wound up getting software that would do it on my PC and just pulling all the images out.  Which you can do from any video, so this is an ineffective feature (at least for me).  I wanted something that would create 30 images/second, which I could go through on a real screen and post quickly.  As this feature is why I chose the Lumix over a Nikon, I'm a little annoyed at their implementation.<br/>Cons:<br/>Low light conditions for moving subjects are awful.  To the point that you will have low light issues in places you didn't realize were low light, and there is no "action" choice on the selector.  The F2.8 for the lens in wide isn't matched by a very sensitive sensor, or it's not automatically upping the sensitivity as needed.  I have a ton of blurry shots of my kids because of this.  I've played with the light levels and it is cludgey at best, completely ineffective at worst.  I've hit a sweet spot a couple of times by setting it to 1/60th of a second, but it still has issues (and my kids aren't that fast).  This is an AMAZING outdoor daytime camera, but for kids in a bounce house it doesn't work for me.<br/>No Focus Ring, so obstructed zoom is hit or miss.  Generally, zoom and autofocus are fantastic and FAST.  This means that taking a picture of wildlife that is partially obstructed by a branch means that you may get a fantastic shot of a leaf instead of the Pileated Woodpecker you were trying for.  Also, since the aperture only goes to F-8, there's a limit to how much depth you can get so that crystal clear leaf may only be 6 inches closer than the woodpecker, but, oh well.<br/>Very limited options on the selection wheel. They've got the fab 5 (auto, P, A, S, M), then Expressive (for filters), Portrait, Panoramic, C? (maybe custom, but defaults to 1080p/60fps), and then Video (for adjusting settings in video mode)<br/>My last complaint is the smallest, the features (like C above) are poorly explained on screen (aperture is only "A", which isn't useful to noobs), which means that Panasonic style features are not understandable to people with more experience.  I accidentally turned on the feature of take 3 shots and merge them which doesn't work for kids moving (but would be great for landscape shots).  Missed 1/2 of my kids' Karate class trying to fix it instead of taking pictures.<br/><br/>Overall, this is an AWESOME camera if you are taking zoomed pictures or videos in sunlight, or of non-moving subjects.  The autofocusing on a leaf can be annoying, but survivable.  The wifi, etc. is nice but not particularly useful for me.  I have tested it and it'd be great to put on a monopod and use your phone to selection shots in a crowd.  And for $300, no SLR can compare on value.  However, once Canon comes out with the T8i, if the 4k is good, I'll likely put this on craigslist.  Because of the crappy low light, I still use my Canon T4i if I'm going somewhere like the Baltimore Aquarium or Natural History Museum with my boys, and this camera should have put my T4i to bed.</span>

<span>This is the third Kodak I've purchased in the last 10 years. The first two were Kodak Share's and were great, but no longer produced. When I say the third camera a person has to realize that I use my camera heavy duty 7 months out of the year. I'm a field appraiser and do real estate tax appraisals for three different counties every year. As I'm doing my work I take pictures of any new structures or anything that would affect value of properties. Often that can mean as many as 50 per day. They took lots of wear &amp; tear but held up really well. The first I dropped on a concrete walk. Needless to say, not the fault of the camera. The last one developed a problem in the spring lever that holds the batteries causing it not to stay closed well. I've spent the last three weeks with packing tape holding it shut! 🤣<br/>Then I decided to try the new PixPro, which I ordered through Amazon with very quick service from the dealer. It's so closely made to my others that I don't think it will take any time to master! And even better magnification! 40x where my others were only 20x. I use this feature a lot as many properties are inaccessible with a normal range.<br/>My only problem that is preventing using it right away is the camera to computer downloading. With my previous cameras I could download my pictures with the days pictures dated and numbered 1 through the end. I could delete those pictures then start over the next day with 1 . I've not figured out how to master this and am planning on calling the company for help. Right now, if I delete 12 and delete, the next day will be 13, etc.<br/>I know there are lots of $$$cameras out there but for my use, Kodak can't be beat! I'll follow up with my service form the dealer if my concerned can be addressed.</span>

<span>I bought this camera because it has the basic controls that I need and because it uses AA batteries. All of my cameras use AA batteries, and I have boxes of NiMH rechargeables that I use in many of my electronic devices. They work fine in all of my other cameras.<br/><br/>The KodakAZ401 camera itself is not bad for the price, but in spite of what it says in the documentation, it will not run on the power supplied by NiMH batteries.  With freshly charged NiMH batteries in it, the camera works for a few hours, and then it turns itself off declaring that the batteries are dead.<br/><br/>I put top-of-the-line Eneloop NiMH batteries, fresh out of the charger, into the camera. The camera immediately showed that the batteries were low. A day later, the battery indicator showed that the batteries were dead. I had taken about 6 photographs to test the camera.<br/><br/>I took the batteries out and measured the Voltage. It was 1.320 Volts. That is a fully charged NiMH battery. I continued testing it to see what would happen, and a few hours later, the camera displayed a message saying that the batteries were depleted and then turned itself off. I measured the Voltage on the batteries, and it was 1.26 Volts. 1.26 Volts, is normal operating voltage for a NiMH battery.  NiMH batteries come out of the charger at up to 1.4 Volts, but then quickly drop down to 1.2 Volts for the duration of their charge cycle. So 1.26 Volts is a fully charged NiMH battery.<br/><br/>The camera battery type was properly set to NI-MH in the settings menu.<br/><br/>I took the very same batteries out of the Kodak camera and put them into my Nikon CoolPix camera. The Nikon indicates that they are fully charged. I cycled another set of freshly charged NiMH batteries through the Kodak AZ401 and they had the same problem. The camera immediately indicated that the batteries were low, and after a short time it indicated that they were dead. There is nothing wrong with the batteries. They work in all of my other devices.<br/><br/>I took a total of 10 photos with this camera, and that depleted two sets of freshly charged NiMH batteries. That makes the camera unusable.<br/><br/>The Kodak AZ401 camera will not run on the power supplied by NiMH batteries.<br/><br/>Given the many other comments about battery issues, this is clearly a design flaw and not a malfunctioning device, so I returned the camera for a refund.</span>

<span>I'm still learning a lot of the features of this camera even though I've been using a Nikon CoolPix in different variations for over 15 years.<br/><br/>Pros:  The fold down tilting LCD view screen is an amazing feature.  Easy Bluetooth connection to my phone but not a feature that I really use.<br/><br/>Cons:  I miss that the flash doesn't automatically pop up and work when you need it.  If you don't manually open it, it doesn't flash even on auto mode.  The 80x zoom is great for pictures of the moon but really hard to focus on anything much closer than the moon.  It's much larger than previous Coolpix point and shoot cameras but has more features so I guess that's to be expected.  The battery compartment where the SD card is located is difficult to open and close.  My pictures all need to be downloaded to my PC so I have to do this often and the batteries make it difficult since they want to pop up all the time and cause pressure on the opening plate.  Deleting a photo during a session takes a full 30 seconds - was pretty instantaneous on my previous Nikon camera.<br/><br/>Overall a really great quality camera with awesome quality photos but not as simple as other Nikon Coolpix cameras.</span>

<span>I bought this camera so that I could take better long-distance photos with the higher-power optical zoom, and it works just fine for that purpose.  I also wanted a camera that would work on AA batteries, since these batteries are plentiful and can be purchased almost anywhere.<br/><br/>The one time that I did go out to shoot some photos with a different camera that used a rechargeable battery pack, I think that I was able to shoot perhaps 50 images before the battery gave out, so after that, I use AA batteries only, until something better comes along.  With this camera, I was able to shoot 1014 images and videos with my first set of batteries, and being able to carry several spare sets of batteries gives one peace of mind while shooting photos.<br/><br/>This camera has several discrete modes for different situations, such as portrait modes and night-photography modes.  The night modes seem to require the use of the flash, which would not be useful at any distance beyond about 20 feet (6 meters) or so.  For night photography, I prefer using one of the other modes, then adjusting the light exposure level to adjust the brightness of the image.<br/><br/>I would advise new users to familiarize themselves with the various modes, and explore the menu options that are included with each mode.  For example, the user can manually adjust the color saturation and the light exposure of the image, but finding this feature requires the user to navigate through the menus, so by all means, do some exploring and learning before going out to shoot some photos.<br/><br/>The one issue that I have had with this camera is with the auto-focus when shooting video of moving subjects.  In video mode, the auto-focus feature has 2 modes, one of which is a continuous mode that continuously adjusts the auto-focus while shooting video.  I would recommend against using this mode, because the continuous auto-focus tends to lose its lock on the subject and causes the video image to lose focus entirely.<br/><br/>I would have preferred to see some more manual shooting options, such as the ability to manually adjust the aperture, the shutter speed, and especially manual focus, but one can use the various settings and modes in this camera to compensate, at least most of the time.</span>
