<span>I bought these simply to talk with the homies and enjoy some nice sounding music and game sounds. But on top of that! It blocks off a lot of outside noise like my nagging wife! I can barely hear her nagging at me to finally get a damn job. Would recommend.</span>

<blockquote><em><div class="a-row a-spacing-small review-data"><span class="a-size-base review-text review-text-content" data-hook="review-body">
<span>UPDATE 5/20/22: I still love this headset and the software updates that have been added since I got it. The newest features block out chewing noises, something I never knew could be so useful. I actually haven't noticed the volume wheel giving me any issues lately, which is nice, but I still haven't bothered with the rgb custom settings.<br/><br/>I have found that sometimes the ear pads will move lower than my ears and sit really close to my cervical lymph nodes, which I'm only aware of because I got an infection and swelling in my throat on one side that nearly closed my airway before I was able to see a doctor and get it treated. Now I keep the sizing on a smaller setting so it won't sit low enough to put pressure on that area. I don't know for sure that's what caused the problem, but I'd rather not go through that again to find out.<br/><br/>ORIGINAL REVIEW:<br/>There are so many big, bulky, black and red/gray/blue headsets out there, but not a lot that are feminine unless you want PINK. Which I don't. I was very excited to find this in white with a swappable fabric strap, though the purples and blues in the strap are pretty much exactly what I was looking for.<br/><br/>First off, I have a very soft voice. Cheap headsets do a poor job of picking my voice out of background noise, and I end up being suppressed more than anything else. While gaming with friends, they have expressed concerns that I am being smothered with a pillow, have fallen out of my chair and my headset slid across the room, or that I am sleep-gaming. Right out of the box, this headset has put all their worries to rest. It transmits my voice at a volume that no longer requires them to turn their game volume nearly all the way down just to hear me. I installed the G Hub application, enabled the Blue VO!CE feature, and selected the "High Voice - Soft" profile after testing out a few others. Suddenly I could be heard as well as any one else in the chat, and I had to remember to keep my under-breath commentary to internal only.<br/><br/>Those friends say the noise suppression is great on this headset too. I have a loud brother who, on a regular basis, walks around the house with his headset on, wailing his superiority for all the neighborhood to hear. With my previous headset, I could see my name light up in discord when he was talking in the next room over MORE than when I was talking (a testament to how quiet my voice is). With the G733, he can be screeching like a YouTube gamer right outside my room, and the noise suppression blocks him out. The thick cushion earpads do a pretty hefty job of blocking him out of my own cranial receptors, so we no longer have to pretend he is in the voice channel with us.<br/><br/>The only down side I have found so far has to do with the volume control. Sometimes, the display pops up showing an incorrect 100% volume level, and turning the wheel seems to have no effect on the volume whatsoever. Other times it just decides to work. My 10 minutes of internet research found that this is a problem with most Logitech devices, so I'm not going to be mad about it.<br/><br/>The LightSync feature allows you to change the colors that show on the LED strips, as well as the way they glow. It rarely seems to work when I try to pick just a couple of colors, and once I unplug the receiver and plug it back in, that setting is dumped, and the default rainbow rotation begins again. I have given up trying to personalize it. I don't have the patience to repeat myself over and over.<br/><br/>All in all I am extremely happy with the abilities of this headset for the price I paid. It is super cute, makes my voice audible, blocks out my brother's raid commentary, and is actually surprisingly comfortable.</span>

<span>As someone who has an issue with headsets being too tight on my head, this headset is awesome! I totally forget it’s there. The noise canceling is pretty decent, can’t hear someone creeping up behind me. Sound quality is pretty good, would prefer better bass though lol. Love that I can just unplug the mic and replace it if it breaks down the line.</span>

<span>Been using these for a while and I absolutely love them. Only downside is occasionally when booting up the computer and the software for the headphone, it won’t recognize my mic being plugged in. But it’s an easy fix. Other than that, they are lightweight. Super comfy, don’t give me headaches and the sounds quality is amazing</span>

<span>Again, i tried logitech and hyperX headsets and then tried the razer blackshark v2's. Seriously these are super good quality, comfy and great everything.  One thing is, they are definitely noise canceling and are kinda heavy on your ears, but i think i just need to get used to it.<br/><br/>Anyways again razer just makes the best accessories from wireless mice, keyboard and now headsets. Seriously, i always try everything else fist ROG STRIX, logitech etc and always end up with razer b/c they are truly the best. unbiased i just love their quality.</span>

<span>I bought these after having wired Astro A40s because I wanted to try having a wireless headset and these were on Prime.  Compared to those, the sound quality is pretty good and the wireless works okay, even though it has a pretty small range.  I don't like how quickly the headphones deactivate/go into sleep mode, even when I have stuff that is making sound on my computer.  If it was possible to disable the "sleep mode" completely, I would like these a lot more.  It also seems that the battery is much quicker to drain now after like 5 months of having these headphones.</span>

<span>I was NOT expecting it to require a dedicated USB dongle.  Although it likely uses a Bluetooth signal it is proprietary through the included USB Dongle.  You can't just pair it up with your existing Bluetooth and will need to have a open USB port (Type A) to plug it into.<br/><br/>However, I kind of like this approach as the dongle loads as a HID (human interface device).  So for me, that means I don't have to turn on my Bluetooth.  From a computer standpoint this has some marked performance improvement.<br/><br/>So it worked for me, and I considered taking away a star for this but decided not to.<br/><br/>One thing that is good is you can use it wired.  But this can be complicated if you don't have a combined stereo and mic port (4 segment plug).  My computer has these separate which requires you get the proper adapter cable so it "Y" connects to the Speaker and Mic jacks.  But again, I like the dongle wireless connection.<br/><br/>Sound is fantastic, Full and Rich.<br/><br/>Mic is outstanding, very directional so you don't pic up a lot of stray noises and what people hear on the other end is simply great quality.<br/><br/>Very cushy headset, comfortable but likely be a little hot on a hot day.  That is something that is typical of any headphone... but overall these are super comfortable.<br/><br/>The mic is removable, just unplugs from the headset or you can mute the mic with a button on the headset.  Both are great features.<br/><br/>I used them for 3 hours with zero issues, not sure how long the battery will last as this was as long as I needed.  However if the battery is low you can always plug them in (standard usb cord) and charge them while you wear them.<br/><br/>I was disappointed in the fact that you can't USB cord connect the speakers/mic.  Seemed something they should have done...  Maybe I will deduct a star.<br/><br/>But I am very happy with them for what I use them for, and would recommend them to others.  Just need to understand the limitations... and that should be clearer in sales promotions too.</span>

<span>Ive been gaming since 1985. Ive owned a LOT of gaming headsets. The most recent was a SteelSeries Wireless Pro that retails for $350. This Razr blows it out of the water!<br/><br/>In fact, this headset beats any Sony, Bose, Turtle Beach, SteelSeries, or anything else Ive ripped off and thrown at the wall because I just lost 50k souls to a random Hallow<br/><br/>I read a few trusted sources for reviews and was a bit in disbelief about their gushing over this headset, this isnt what Razer is known for. I have an MMO mouse from them for the launch of Diablo 3 back in 2011, THAT is what they are know for. I still use it to this day, no issues<br/><br/>Now…now they are known as the Lords of Boom!<br/><br/>Being old, I didnt like that I had to download an app to get the full force of this headset (Synapse 3). But it basically runs itself, and you can modify any aspect of the 7.1 surround sound, even the points of contact and hz levels (goodbye campers!)<br/><br/>In all seriousness, I have never been this blown away by a headset before. Razer is the one ring of sound. Get this while its still on sale!<br/><br/>Its also comfortable AF!  (See that millennials?  Thats called adaptation!)<br/><br/>👋<br/>.<br/>.<br/>.<br/>.<br/>.<br/>.<br/>.<br/>🎤</span>

<span>These have been my everyday headset since 2018 when I first got my PC. My old pair still works great but they are starting to wear down and getting stretched out.<br/><br/>Having owned many headsets in the past, the Corsair Elites is hands down my favorite set that I've owned. The sound quality is top notch, I can hear everything coming in games and the mic is great when talking on Discord as people have said my voice comes through super clearly.<br/><br/>These are priced very fairly too, I got this set for 79.99 which is what I paid for my first Void Elite 4 years ago and in these times of inflation and rising prices, that was a very fair price. They aren't noise cancelling and the rgb is minimal, plus you can turn that off to save on battery power. They are lightweight and feel very comfortable on my head and fit over my ears so they don't sweat or get fatigued.<br/><br/>Very good deal for your money and ones that will last a long time as well.</span>

<span>This headset was recently purchased for streaming and other uses such as work. I love the ergonomics of the headset but it does have some nuances that will need to make this head set run properly and at its optimal settings for Windows 10.<br/><br/>If you're hearing feedback from your mic:<br/>This is the "Sidetone" listed inthe ICue program from Corsair's website. You can deactivate this by sliding the bar down for it in the program to 0 or you can press and hold the mute button for 5 seconds and it'll switch between it being on or off depending on your preference (some people like it on for streams).<br/><br/>If you're wondering why does the sound sound like you're listening to the audio with your ear in a cardboard tube:<br/>This is audio dropoff from possible multiple reasons depending on your set up.<br/>1: check to make sure Windows Spatial (Windows Sonic for headphones) IS enabled.<br/>2: make sure the audio output in the window sound settings is not on Nvida Broadcast (AKA RTX voice) and is on the Corsair headset option instead. It would be wise to turn off all options for speakers on Nvida Broadcast for using this headset. You can still use it for the mic however.<br/>3: double check you have the latest firmware on your headset. It's done through the ICUE app on Corsair's website.<br/><br/>The noise canceling is decent but that's due to the design. The ear cups cover the entire ear (going around the ear unless you have elephant ears). The mesh muffs are quite nice for breathability and keep the heat down. There is some pressure on the head from the headset's weight and the headset pushing a little hard fresh out of the box on pressure points around the ear but those will go away after good use and "stretching out" the headset to a more worn in feel (don't try to stretch out the band yourself just let it happen naturally).<br/><br/>The worst parts to this product are not related to the product:<br/>Windows spatial doesn't have an equalizer. For audiophiles, this is kinda a let down, but again this isn't corsair's fault. The stock one in ICUE isn't the best either... which is their fault.<br/><br/>The dongle is pretty chonky but seems durable to a point. Wouldn't recommend pulling it out often if you have too.<br/><br/>Good headset and after doing the changes to get the audio to work, it's a decent wireless headset for the price of 60. Go for it but don't expect absolute perfection from it... 8.5/10</span>

<span>Awesome headset. I lost the dongle to my last one when I moved, and I liked it so much I bought it again. Its super comfy and I can wear it for hours without my bears getting sore. Works on my desktop computer and I can easily switch the dongle to my work laptop or PS4 and it connects instantly.<br/><br/>Original bought because I like mics with voice feedback, but I found out I didn’t care as much as I used to, so I simply disabled it in the software settings. Settings let you change the LED light to make it match my computer RGB. I try not to mess with the sound settings much, but those options are there too, with some presets ready as well.<br/><br/>The mic is flip to mute, or you can click the mute button. You’ll know its muted because the end of the mic will be lit up red, so theres no accidentally talking while you’ve been muted the whole time. Plus theres a lil woman that tells you when its muted or getting powered off, pretty neat.</span>

<span>TLDR : costs too much, battery is absolutely terrible, somewhere around 6 hours. It's been 2 months and I'm shopping for a different unit. Triple the battery life and I'll spend 10 bucks more for the battery! Plus have feedback on mic, so you can hear your voice better and realize when you're getting loud /too excited.<br/><br/>Comfort - 4/5 light weight, fits snug, but doesn't breathe well. Not recommended for warm /hot climates.<br/><br/>Sound quality - 5/5 very good sound. No complaints.<br/><br/>Connectivity - 5/5 no complaints.<br/><br/>Functionality - 3/5 handful of times was muted with the microphone 'on' with no indication I was muted, on either ps4, my game, or the headset (no mute led indicator).<br/><br/>Cost - 1/5 90 dollars for this headset? Really? 90 dollars? Only benefit is I signed up with Amazon where it split my payments over 3 months and that was cheaper than buying in the store cuz, I was in between jobs and my headset broke at that exact time.<br/><br/>Battery life - ZERO STARS!<br/>I'm lucky to get more than 6 hours out of this thing. My old Samsung phone that I used pretty much 24/7 for 4 years straight had a better battery life than this, and I had to charge it 2 or 3 times a day! If you're looking to play for 2 or 3 hours a day, you need to charge it every days. If you're going to play for 4 hours, better charge every night, cuz that second night it will die on you. My point - you shouldn't have to do math on when you need to charge your headset. Yea it beeps, and there's a light. That blinks. But my headset that had a 20+ hour life would beep for an hour. This one beeps for 20 min maybe and you're done. Worst battery on a headset that I've seen in my life.<br/><br/>In comparison, I had a lucidsound ls31le that lasted almost 2 years with zero problems. Then the metal gear inside the ear swivel ate through the plastic and there was sharp plastic poking my head.<br/><br/>First time I bought the lucid sound, mine was 60 dollars. Then I bought one for my gf for 40 dollars within a few months. 100 dollars and I already got two years of life out of that money. My gf unit is still going strong, but shes not as much of a gamer as I am, and I'm a little rough on my stuff.<br/><br/>Recommendations?<br/>Buy a headset stand or clip that will go on a desk to hold your headset. Away from pets. It will help your unit last longer. Happier with that 10 dollar purchase than anything else...</span>

<span>They are definitely a good budget headset. My only complaint is sometimes the power on button can be weird and not turn on the headset at first. It’ll turn on after another try or two. Other then that issue it’s a pretty solid headset for the price. It’s a great middle ground between cheaper alternatives and more expensive ones.</span>

<span>after my 3rd logitech headset going kaput, I wanted to try another headset and stick to the "gaming" aspect as I do enjoy the faux-surround. giving razer a shot, again, I do not regret this purchase.<br/><br/>i use "movie" mode for games and it sounds very good. spatial awareness is precise, and I feel the THX spatial sound is a bit more "exact" and specific with its environmental sounds compared to using the DTS Headphone X: 2.0 which I find to be a good thing for what I play (Bf4, Bf1, R6, Battlefront 2).<br/><br/>I have never had an issue with razer synapse in the past, so all the gripe people have with it I do not understand since I have had no issues with with my other razer peripherals. synapse gives lots of customization to make your sound profile fit what you like. bass boost, ANC, mic adjustments, and EQ are just a few things.<br/><br/>battery life has been great. better than logitechs (12hrs is such crap). charging is fast as well - it was at 76% when I had first received the headset, and charging took less than 15 mins.<br/><br/>the mic is standard - nothing special - it's enough to let the team, person, etc hear you and know what you are saying but that's it. it is nothing to drive home about.<br/><br/>comfort is great - i havent had to take them off once during game sessions and they fit snug which i really enjoy. they dont feel like theyll fall off.<br/><br/>the build quality is so-so - being that the headset is primarily plastic it does give it a cheap look and feel, but a heavier headset is not the smartest thing if you want to be comfortable in them, at least for me anyways. the band is at least metal when adjusting, so hooray for that.<br/><br/>the switch button between Bluetooth and 2.4ghz is awesome. i use it all the time to play mobile games and my pc games. i really enjoy that i can use this headset with nearly everything i own without having to switch headsets constantly. super convenient.<br/><br/>the carrying case is awesome! super nice and travel friendly. really like how that is included.<br/><br/>all in all this headset, albeit i do feel the price should be maybe 50 or so dollars less, is worth the investment. for me, it's worth it as i can swap between mobile and PC without changing headsets and answer calls of course. the sound is great and very spacious. even if the headset may feel cheap, when using them you will think otherwise. if you need a new headset i do recommend these for both gaming and casual use.</span>

I can't quite remember if these do have noise cancelation but if they do I'm sure it's stupendous. They just work great all around.

<span>This is pretty good headset.  When my steelseries headset finally broke, I was looking for a high end headset I can use for work and gaming.

It changes very quickly though, and is so comfortable and has such good sound, I probably would get the same headset again if this broke.

<span>So, I was in the market for a new wireless headset my last Corsair set died, and it was one of the best headsets I'd owned, their HD2100s. But since then I've gotten a wired pair of ATH m50x which are far more superb in sound quality and the comfort I find in the Soundcore Q35 is phenomenal. I wanted something that could perhaps merge the two: great comfort, great sound... wireless.<br/><br/>The Virtuoso's just weren't comfortable. The clamping force was too intense for me (with glasses) and the cups were too stiff as well. The clamping may have been able to be backed off over time, but I didn't want to suffer through a breaking in period.<br/><br/>The range was so-so, on par with other USB wireless headsets I've been messing with but still far under my older headsets like my Logitech G930s or Corsair's own HD2100's, both of which could walk out to the mailbox without even a crackling. Just my G930s would sometimes just stop connecting at all...<br/><br/>The software was also a tad buggy... The EQ just never worked at all and I couldn't get any noticeable difference from the surround. The positional audio was just as good as my wired stereo studio monitors, worse likely due to them being open back and having a better soundstage. The one thing the iCUE software could do was sync the RGB on my headphones with the RGB from my Asus Aura Sync on my laptop.<br/><br/>Which was probably the part that made me so hesitant to send these back. They're so pretty! I got the pearl ones (white with gold accents) and the RGB was actually subtle. The cables just feel premium. The whole product is solid, with metal in the joints and the band and around the ends of the plugs. It had USB wireless, USB-C wired (the only USB-C of the ones I tested btw) and an 3.5mm combo cable. It had options and it sounded beautifully over the aux through my FiiO Andes, better than on the USB wireless by far.<br/><br/>They were just uncomfortable. I couldn't wear them for long at all and found myself actually pulling out my wired audio technicas or just playing things through my monitor's built-in speakers when it wasn't gaming.<br/><br/>For contrast, I have also been testing around with EPOS GSP 370. The sound and comfort are in another league above the Virtuoso. I just wish the GSP370's had USB-C and an auxport. But over the last several days, I've just found myself reaching for the EPOS over the Corsair until I found myself putting the Corsairs back into their box and getting a return for them. It's a shame, because they are so pretty.<br/><br/>Overall, I found the sound quality very fair for a gaming headset, just couldn't get the software working on Windows 11 22h2, you may have better luck on Windows 10 or an earlier 11 release. They looks amazing. And the removable microphone sounds fair as well. Just the price seems a bit more than those relatively fair numbers, especially when the GSP370's are $50 cheaper and the Hyper-X Air's are over half the price for comparable audio and superior comfort and battery.<br/><br/>But yeah... they're so pretty &gt;.&lt;</span>

<span>My Corsair Void pro went out on me so I thought this would be an upgrade. As far as sound quality and mic quality its much better. But for gaming and wearing them long periods of time its extremely uncomfortable on the top headband. Its like wrapping metal around your hairline. I bought a extended pad off amazon and it didnt really fix it. I give them 2/5 stars for comfort but 4/5 for quality.</span>

<blockquote><em><div class="a-row a-spacing-small review-data"><span class="a-size-base review-text review-text-content" data-hook="review-body">
<span>I love the headset, but there are some important things to note.<br/><br/>It is not comfortable out of the box, BUT it will break in. It does get more comfortable; it gave me a headache the first day I wore it, but now, it's very soft and easy to wear for long periods of time. However, I would still recommend buying a pad for the top to make it that much better. I don't regret that addition to the headset.<br/><br/>Further, the sound quality out of the box is not great, but with Dolby Atmos, it's excellent. Seriously, it goes from subpar to a strong offering with the addition of Atmos/spacial sound. And the 3D Tempest audio on the PS5 also works well with the headset. So, a knock for that (honestly the biggest reason it's 4 stars instead of 5) since this is a gaming headset and the audio should be the focus. BUT, even then, iCue lets you set your own preset EQ, so Atmos isn't even a need, and it should work well with PS5 out of the box (although I absolutely recommend getting Atmos if on PC).<br/><br/>Battery life is okay. I'd say it clears the minimum expectation, but I am not impressed. It works, and that's okay. I can do long gaming sessions (6-7 hours) uninterrupted easily. So, if you charge regularly, it shouldnt be an issue.<br/><br/>Now, on to the best stuff:<br/>You can listen to simultaneous audio via 3.5mm connection at the same time as wired USB or Wireless. That means you can plug your switch in via 3.5mm and your PC or PS5 via USB or Wireless - and hear both sources at the same time. That's great considering Razer and other alternatives don't offer that on headset in a similar price range, like the Karia pro, which can connect to two sources but doesn't play them at the same time. This is a huge feature if you like to do Discord with PlayStation or Switch. And the mic will output via 3.5mm, so you can use Discord on your phone and listen to game audio via wireless or USB.<br/><br/>Another great feature is it turns itself off if it doesn't move or have audio playing for a while. Then when you move it again, it turns itself back on. Not essential, but nice that it wont drain itself when you forget to turn it off. Makes the battery last a lot longer and makes the 20 hours on a full charge feel like more.<br/><br/>And the mic is great!! Don't get the more expensive SE (worse mic, very similar feature set, more expensive). the base RGB has a killer mic. I have the El Gato Wave 3 desk mic, and although the stand alone mic is clearly better, this headset is much closer than I ever would have expected. Sure, it's not an SM7B, but it's the best wireless headset mic I've encountered.<br/><br/>Build quality SEEMS good. I've only had it for a short time, but the headset is heavy (might be a negative for some), but feels solid, which I like.<br/><br/>It's much more aesthetically pleasing in person too. I thought it looked OK in the pictures, but I was frustrated with the lack of quality from other headsets that came with issues out of the box, which I had to RMA, so I took a risk on the Virtoso RGB because of good reviews and feature set. But, I have to say I love the look of it now.<br/><br/>Overall, if you can get it for the sale price of $140, it's a no-brainer over the WIRELESS competition. (Wired will certainly offer you better options for less money, but I personally wanted a wireless headset), and for the full price, I think it's decent compared to competitors.<br/><br/>I think Steelseries could give this a run for its money, but their build quality is very poor and the audio drivers are worse (although maybe a little better right out of the box). So, I'd lean toward this, but I also understand the appeal of simultaneous bluetooth and wireless on the 9+ and Pro Steelseries models. But again, at the sale price, if you can get it, the Virtoso RGB is the best option from my perspective.<br/><br/>4 stars because of the audio out of the box, the headband could be more comfortable, and subpar battery for this price range. Everything else seems good. RGB is cool but not something I needed or care about, but could be a plus for others.<br/><br/>Also the side tone is better than Razer and on-par with Steelseries (if not a little better bc of mic quality on Virtoso), but you'll need to set it up in iCue.<br/><br/>Edit: The ear cups actually do move a little bit, which I didn't realize because it's very stiff (which is nice, it doesn't move around too much). This has helped a lot with the noise isolation! If I could give 4.5, I think that's accurate (as long as you're on PC with dolby atmos, I'd consider a 5/5)</span>

<span>I knew I’d have to pay decent $ for a wireless headset, but this one seemed on the cheaper side while still having everything I wanted. It’s super easy to connect and use. The side buttons and dials are taking some getting used to, but I love how much you can adjust on just the headset- party chat and game chat adjustments. One small inconvenience is it seems a little tight on my head. I’ve left it stretched over something for a day or so and it’s helped, but it was causing a headache after the first day.<br/>The second more important issue I’ve been having is with the mute switch. You actually flip the mic up when you want to mute it. However, it’s very slow in recognizing when you switch- I can switch off mute and it takes 10 seconds to actually connect me back. I’ve also started having problems with it not knowing or registering when I’m trying to mute it. It’ll just keep beeping at me or it just won’t mute at all. If it weren’t for the mute switch issues, this would be a 10/10 for me.</span>

<span>Turtle Beach has to be one of my favorites add on game changers. I will never be able to play a game or watch a movie without headphones again. It picks up a bunch of sounds that you can’t hear on the TV very well. One example is I was playing red dead redemption, the first game, and the cougars kept killing me constantly. As soon as we got an older pair of turtle beach wireless headphones, I can hear the cougars creeping up behind me and I was hooked ever since.<br/>I was very excited about this purchase because back in the day a very good pair of headphones would cost anywhere between two to $400. Our very first purchase was about $299. They lasted about 10 years and when it came to replace them I was worried, but when I found these cheaper pairs I was skeptical but it was in my price range. When I got them they were very well packaged and came very quickly. It did come with instructions in the box. I am delighted to say that these cheaper headphones are almost as good as the very expensive pair we got 10 years ago.</span>

<span>These are some pretty good wireless headphones, with a detachable mic which makes it even better for travelling and compact storage. The sound quality is great for wireless headphones, and the mic monitoring is useful if you need to watch how loud you are or to know where you need to have the mic for optimal voice input. The headphones are moderately comfortable, and I barely notice them after a few hours of wear. The Swarm software is okay, it does the job I need it to do, but it is a bit complicated.<br/><br/>The only thing I dislike is how the Swarm software is set up. You may have seen other comments about the mic monitor and other settings resetting themselves, and that's because you actually have to hit "apply" at the bottom right of the window. That's right, without making any sort of attempt to tell you, you have to apply changes to make them stick, rather than the changes you make automatically taking effect. As an aside, you can hear the changes you make, such as turning the mic monitor volume off or turning on surround sound 7.0, but these changes only stick around until you close the Swarm window.<br/><br/>I only discovered this recently (having had the headphones for a few weeks now). There's also an auto-apply option, which shows that Roccat's software is capable of applying changes as they're made, but decided to make a hard to see option on the bottom of the window instead.<br/><br/>Seeing as Swarm is still getting regular updates, Roccat, I think that you should make "Auto Apply" on by default. It's just good UX, you know? If you can hear the changes, you expect them to be applied already.<br/><br/>Besides that small issue with the software, I think these are some really good headphones.</span>

<span>Definitely my favorite wireless gaming headset yet. After several months, I've had no major issues with them, so I feel comfortable recommending them generally. I do have a couple warnings and a few nitpicky gripes detailed below.<br/><br/>I'll say the battery life is excellent. I can go well over a week in between charges, compared to my previous headset which I needed to plug in twice a week or so. Audio quality is great. The fidelity is decent, and the balance feels good when the EQ is set to default, which I recommend keeping it at.<br/><br/>The comfort level is insane. I have massive ears that stick out an unfair amount, so I still haven't found headphones that I can wear for more than about two hours before it starts hurting, but I find these need far less repositioning than other headphones. I'll also say that the headband is very well-designed. I expect this sort of band on studio-grade headphones, so to find it available here is epic. You don't need to adjust the height, they just go on and you forget about them unless you're walking around or bouncing (as they have some springiness to them).<br/><br/>Some warnings about these headphones:<br/>- NOT ACTUALLY SURROUND SOUND! Most headphones use an audio filter that gives spaaace to stereo output, but this headset goes so far as to accept 7.1 audio in and then condense it down to stereo on the headphones. The surround sound boxes you can check garble the otherwise okay audio just like any other alleged surround sound headphones will.<br/>- The knobs are software-based controllers, they adjust the volume set in Windows, etc. This may or may not be what you want. I prefer an analog dial on my headset to allow for finer adjusting.<br/><br/>I do have a few gripes, which I'll add so y'all can be aware.<br/><br/>- The companion software is a bit clunky, and it turns out the onboard memory only remembers...nothing? I was at least hoping the headset would remember that I wanted the RGB off, as it's impressively bright, which is fine for most people, but I find the light to be rather distracting and painful in low-light environments.<br/><br/>- The headphones take several seconds to connect. Anywhere between 10 and 60, though usually 20-30, so as long as you don't forget to turn them on until you're game is loaded, it's no real bother...sadly I'm rather forgetful.<br/><br/>- No headphone jack...why? I don't get why that's so hard, and to rub salt in the wound, the USB-C jack is for charging and firmware updates only. These headphones are literally wireless only for audio. Thankfully they can charge while in use, unlike other headsets I've used.<br/><br/>- Also the second knob is microphone feedback. I don't know why it exists, as I generally can hear what I'm saying out loud, and it doesn't help with hearing other people (ex. parents/spectators) as the microphone does good at keeping that noise down. Most other headphones will use that to adjust voice chat volume, which I'd prefer a lot more.<br/><br/>- Finally, these headphones are surprisingly loud. Too loud, if you ask me. I do prefer my volume set a lot lower than most people, so keep that in mind, but if I were to guess at what normal folks would like, I'd wager you wouldn't want these set above 40-45 percent in Windows. Louder than that, and you're likely to degrade you're hearing. Keep that in mind if you're buying these for a child who may not know better.<br/><br/>Overall, these headphones are great, so long as the small drawbacks don't really get bother you. Personally, I'd expect a bit a little more seamlessness from $100 headphones, but I got a much cheaper used pair, so I'm quite satisfied with what I have for what I paid.</span>

<span>Elo 7.1 Air Wireless<br/> TLDR: I have to jump through countless hoops and wait a long time to get these things to connect, then when they do, the mic doesn't work a lot of the time...there is absolutely NO WAY I could recommend these to anybody else.<br/>I'm sitting here typing out a review on my Roccat keyboard and using my Roccat mouse, which I absolutely love. I feel so blessed to find this brand since I like premium products that most people don't use. I'm like that with my phones, cars, computers, everything. For some reason I just love having things people haven't heard of or seen before, but are top quality. So far Roccat has been that for me. I was hoping these headphones would add to that. The other Roccat products I have use their AIMO lighting integration, so I figured I would go with these headphones since they continue that integration.<br/>After the lengthy background, I'll now get into the actual review. I'll start with the good. First, build quality is great. They are very comfortable. They look awesome, and they have great features. The Roccat Swarm software has plenty of options to adjust the sound, but right out of the box I thought they sounded great. But messing around in the software too much is a quick way to get them to sound a lot worse if you're not careful. Needless to say, from pulling them out of the box, plugging them in, after a somewhat lengthy setup process, and up to the first time I I had them all synced up and played my first game with them, I was impressed. That's pretty much where the good impressions end.<br/>After my first set up, I've had nothing but problems with them. For some crazy and downright unacceptable reason, they do not like to connect. You would think headphone with a USB input, whether wireless or not, would at least connect automatically and without issue if you were to plug them in directly to your computer, right? They don't. I'm not sure I've actually ever got them to connect like that. When I try to connect them wirelessly, nothing usually happens for at least a minute if not at all. The wireless receiver is supposed to blink when syncing. I press the power button on the headphones and the receiver usually does nothing. Sometimes if I wait a few minutes, it will eventually connect. I'm not ok with that, nor should anybody else be. Sometimes if I unplug and plug the receiver back in, it will sync. Sometimes it takes a PC restart to get them to sync.<br/>So not only does the whole headset not sync, the mic also has it's own problems syncing independently from the rest of the headset.  Most of the time after going through all of that to get the headset to sync, I will finally jump into a game and the mic doesn't work. The games will say the mic is connected, but it just doesn't work. I try to press the mic mute and unmute button to no avail. I try to unplug the mic and plug it back in to no avail. I have set it as my default input on my computer and tried everything else I can think of. It usually takes a PC restart or two to get the mic to work.<br/>Ok, so that wasn't brief, and the TLDR was: I have to jump through countless hoops and wait a long time to get these things to connect, then when they do, the mic doesn't work a lot of the time.<br/>I'm not going to return this product, as I hope one day Roccat can get these bugs worked out through software updates. Using Turtle Beach technology along with their ability to make intuitive, polished software and hardware, I'm going to have faith they will make these right one day, in which case I will really like them. But until then, there is absolutely NO WAY I could recommend these to anybody else. Most people can't afford spending this much on a paper weight in hopes they will be useful one day.</span>

<span> Only got a couple hours use, then it would beep constantly and finally one day it wouldn’t turn on. Doesn’t matter what I do. Hard reset and other troubleshooting from Astro didn’t do anything. Amazon is working to get me in touch with Astro for a replacement, but from my experience so far, I can’t say anything good other than it worked great for a couple hours, and then nothing worked. I take good care of my stuff too, and put it away so the kids can’t get to it, so this is very frustrating for me. Also, the stuff they make you go through and the waiting to actually get the product you paid for is so ridiculous.<br/><br/>Edit. I’m bumping this up and giving it another try, Amazon sent another one and if this one is as amazing as the other on but actually works more than a couple times I will definitely bump this review up more. These headsets when they worked were amazing, amazing sound quality that really showcased the 3D sound. I found these to be almost vital when playing returnal because they let me know when someone was behind me, other games they were really helpful in as well, but when they stopped working I stopped playing returnal as much cos I’m excited to get to use them again. Hopefully the pair with the issues were just a fluke, if so I will be sure to update again.</span>

<span>I really like this headset becuase of the price and the fact that it is wireless. But there are times that there is a slight static sounds and I have to turn it off and turn it back on to fix it. Not a huge deal but you know…</span>

<span>So it works with ps4 and pc , you have to press the button on dongle to switch between both modes. Astro command center does not work with this headset. Connection can be hit or miss sometimes. I ended up returning it due to the cost. If I pay $100 I would expect item to perform well. If you use it in single mode it might work perfect but I have to switch between console and pc so it doesn't work for me.</span>

<span>Really happy with this headset. Being able to control the chat/game volumes via Sonar is a must have. It is comfortable, sound is great (cloud have a little more volume though to be excellent) and people have said the mic sound is also awesome. The reason I deducted 1 star is due to applying updates, it does require a technical savy person, some may say their headset has bricked because it can take a few trials to complete the update process and in thr meantime the headset will not turn on... scary moments!</span>

<span>I don’t have a small head but these feel loose like they’re gonna fall of my head if I lean forward or backward. They’re very comfortable if you’re sitting upright though. Sounds quality is pretty basic in my opinion. No bass. Not very loud. The microphone is the main reason I got these and that’s what’s keeping them at four stars. The mic is very good. I like how the tip glows red when you mute it. The chat mix in discord doesn’t work very well or at least it isn’t intuitive to set up. The lag to the wireless receiver is amazingly negligible. Pairing and swapping devices is very quick and simple once you get the hang of it. Not impressed with the feedback sounds for on/off/paired/muted, they seem very cheap and harsh for how well-designed they’re supposed to be. I wish these had Bluetooth.</span>

<span>Having had an Arctic 5 RGB set for years I was looking to upgrade to something wireless, but also not have to go into Pro series territory.  The 7+ (not to be confused with the 7P+) seemed the logical choice.<br/><br/>With 30hrs battery life, no RGB to fuss with (nice if you kind of like a simple headset aesthetic), great 7.1 emulation via Sonar and a solid mic... this set is for you.  It uses a USB-C cable to charge (included), as well as includes the standard USB-C receiver, but also a USB-A to USB-C cable for those without USB-C on their machine.<br/><br/>Battery life is amazing at 30hrs per charge, so far so good there, and performance has been great.  You do need to use the Steel Series app to get things working, but its pretty simple and only takes a few minutes to setup and configure (just turn on Spacial sound for 7.1).  The standalone chat/game audio mixer knob is gone with a wireless set, and in turn its a standard scroll wheel on the RIGHT ear (left is volume).<br/><br/>Honestly, I was quite happy with my Arctis 5's but was looking for a slight bump up and to remove the cables.  I am not dissapointed at all.  I do find myself trying to 'move' the cable that doesn't exist anymore out of habit, but i'll mark that as a win for them since it shows the performance is at or greater (greater in this case) than what it replaced to where I still stay in my gaming habits.<br/><br/>If you're looking for a solid gaming headset with some flexibility, gaming performance, great battery life and ease of use... I highly recommend these.  If wireless is not your thing I recommend the ARCTIS 5 series as they treated me solid for over 2yrs as well!</span>

<span>I usually end up having to swap headsets after a a year or so on average, or at least I did when they were mostly the low to moderately priced "gaming" headsets from other major brands. I'd taken a chance on this version's predecessor the Arctis 3 back in the 360 era and it worked amazingly.<br/><br/>Now that I'm on Series S and looking to move to PC this is the only brand I'll buy for headsets for the foreseeable future. With the USB dongle and the 3.5mm connector I can be on Discord via PC and play games on Xbox, or hanging out in an Xbox party and gaming on my PC.<br/><br/>The sound quality is amazing, and when you work with the SteelSeries GG software to fine tune your settings it only gets better. I use it for everything but it's especially helpful on games where sound is paramount. Battlefield, Dead by Daylight, etc. But the immersion factor in any game is top notch with this headset.</span>
