<span>Amazing for listening to music unless you're expecting to hear a lot of bass. I have slightly above average ears and they just barely fit around my ears, so be careful if you have a large head. The cable is quite long and not detachable which gets in the way sometimes but is not usually an issue. I would buy this product again given the general comfort and great audio quality.</span>

<span>Very happy with these ATH-M20X headphones. I bought them to get a sample of what the ATH-M50X might generally sound like.  I prefer these to my Sennheiser HD 599 SE which cost 3x more. The ATH-M20X have the mids and to a certain extent the highs which are missing from the HD 599's. If you want to hear ALL the music these are for you. I love hearing accentuations I've never heard in recordings I've listened to many times before. If you like bass heavy don't buy these. They aren't lacking in bass, the just aren't bass heavy.</span>

<span>So I got these yesterday, and I know I am not going to keep them for long (more on that later) so I want to get this review in ASAP. First off, while I know what I like &amp; I can recognize quality, I am definitely NOT an audiophile, so I'm not going to try &amp; tell you in TECHNICAL terms why these headphones are so great, but I can give a layman's perspective. Also, I am going to do a lot of comparing to the Samson SR850's I just bought AND my standby Koss PortaPros (which I compared the Samson's to in my review of them) Anyway, lets get started.<br/><br/>First of all the looks of these. My 13 year old daughter unboxed them while I was at work &amp; immediately exclaimed "These are NICE !" With that, she put them on, plugged in her iPod Touch &amp; didn't take them off until I got home several hours later. This from a kid who's favorite headphones are a purple pair of Knockoff Beats I bought at a flea market. They are MUCH better looking than the Samsons. The earcups are smaller &amp; lower profile, and the headband is covered in a stylish black leatherette. There is a LARGE AudioTechnica logo across the top of them, but who's going to be looking at the top of your head ?<br/><br/>As far as comfort goes, they are very comfortable, They are much lighter than the Samson's, and as I said smaller. The ear pads are suitably soft &amp; covered in the same leather like material as the headband. And while I doubt you could lie on your side comfortably with them on, they would be MORE comfortable than the Samson's in that position.<br/><br/>As for build quality, they are REALLY light, which worries me a bit, but they seem very solid. The main structure is definitely metal and the wires are thick &amp; well covered. The plugs also look a step up from your average headphone connector. While I am sure my kids would manage to break them eventually, I think they would last longer than your average headphone. And with me, they will be just fine.<br/><br/>Finally, lets talk sound. They sound AWESOME ! Really awesome. Much better than headphones at this price should sound. When I listened to the Samson's the first time I knew they sounded better than my Koss' ... but not by a lot. These are OBVIOUSLY better. The bass response is better, and everything else is CRYSTAL CLEAR ! Just stunning. That being said, they are not as loud as the Samson's which kinda surprised me since they are smaller &amp; closed back. But because of the better bass &amp; improvements across the full range of sound, I would definitely put these ahead of the Samson's AND the Koss' &amp; I am sure ANYONE who heard them all side by side by side would agree.<br/><br/>Now there are a few negatives. Like I said they are smaller &amp; Lighter than the Samson's. And I was looking for something LARGER ... so in that respect, they are going away from what I was looking for. And I still am surprised the Samsons are slightly louder. With the bigger size they should need more power to drive them properly. But since the M20's have less sound leak than the SR850's, this is really a non-issue.<br/><br/>And while they are very comfortable, after wearing them for a short time its clear that my ears are sweating in the M20's where they were not in the SR850's. Again, it may be because the latter are semi-open, but I think its because of the cloth covering on the SR850's pads AND because they are bigger.<br/><br/>Overall, even with the negatives, I would recommend these over the Samson SR850's w/o question. But, if that extra $15.00 means a lot to you, the Samson's are still an EXCELLENT Choice. And they will probably be my choice, since once my son HEARS these. he will be wanting to trade me the Samson's for them.<br/><br/>UPDATE: I have had these for just about 36 hours &amp; I just had a perfect stranger come up to me &amp; ask me if I liked them.l He obviously knew a lot more about headphones than I do &amp; has much better equipment (a $170 pair of BeyerDynamics) but he was impressed with these especially at the price.<br/><br/>UPDATE to the UPDATE: I recently bought a Fiio E6 Headphone Amp &amp; when my son comes home from College, I will try these out with the Amp. Considering how much they improved my Samson SR850's (I would put that combination AHEAD of these now) I am sure they will sound even more awesome. However,  I will NOT be buying that Amp for my son. If he wants one, he can buy it himself.<br/><br/>IN RESPONSE TO .... the two questions .... First off the Amp improves the M20's as much as it improves the Samson SR850's. The sound is cleaner, and I prefer using the degraded setting on the amp with increased volume on my source on these as well.<br/><br/>Second, as I said without the amp, these sound nearly as good as the Samson's WITH the amp. So I feel I have done enough for my son in that respect. If he wants to UP the quality with the amp, that's his choice. Just because I am not paying for it, doesn't represent my feeling for him one way or another. Of maybe it does. Either way I feel secure in my role as a parent &amp; the opinion of one crank won't affect that.</span>

<span>I've had a lot of different headphones through the past 8 years. I decided to start moving from gaming headphones to higher quality ones after someone made the good point that a better set of headphones is better for music and gaming if you are going for more of an e-sports game. I first tried a set of sennheisers that were terrific, at the time I had not heard of beyerdynamic. I mostly stuck to sennheisers and audio-technica, but I heard good things about this set of headphones and found it on sale for almost half off. After using it for three years or so and the only thing I dislike about these headphones is that I am so spoiled that if I break them I'll need to buy another set for $130 (which I am pretty sure is actually down in price so I'm not as afraid anymore).</span>

<span>EDIT: After a comment by another user I looked at my review and found that perhaps there were some points of seeming ambiguity that I had not intended. So, I made a second pass to clear up my stance on a few things.<br/><br/> While I do not consider myself an audiophile I do like a good pair of headphones. The DT990 250ohm is a very nice set.  I currently own Senns. HD558's, AT-M50's, AKG Q701's, and the DT990 Pros'. I also own an Objective 2 Amp. As an aside If you want/need an affordable headphone amp I highly recommend the O2 and JDS is an excellent supplier. The price at JDS has also dropped a bit over time and at present it's a steal at about $130. I can't recommend it highly enough. I have never tried it, though I plan to, but the Magni 2 by Schiit by all accounts is another very solid budget performer.<br/>NOTICE: I have a particular character flaw. If I go to spend more than $100 on a luxury item I obsess over it for an unnatural amount of time. I read every review at every site twice. I dwell on it for weeks on end. Then I try one out, return it and try something else. It's borderline to being a named disease. The point is I only write a review if I think that what I landed on is a great value or if I am disappointed in all of the effort and thought that went into the purchase.<br/>That, in a nutshell, is what I look for. Best bang for buck not just bragging rights. I think that the difference between $40 cans and $150 cans is HUGE but the difference between $150 cans and $650 is deep into the territory of diminishing returns. I have listened to some expensive setups and my impression was...yeah well MAYBE it sounds a little bit better but not THAT much better. certainly not twice as good. Not even close. It's more like a 5% - 10% gain for  a 300% price increase. This is the perspective that this review is based on.<br/> Each headphone has its own strengths and weaknesses and serves different purposes. I did tons of research before purchasing each one and I bought each one to fill a different niche. In some cases I tried out a few sets that I returned before landing on the ones that I have now. Each headphone that I currently own I am very satisfied with.<br/>However, I have never heard of the one headphone to rule them all. That would need to have perfect freq. response, incredible sound-stage and detail, isolation, super comfy and breathable, perfect for travel, and able to be driven by even wimpy sources . It does not exist man. Not at any price. I am more into having situational variety and the best bang for buck. I think each of these sets are solid choices at their price point for a particular set of needs. I can wholeheartedly recommended each one for their respective niche. Similarly,  I own a gas grill, a charcoal grill and a smoker. None of them does everything perfectly but each accomplishes a specific task exceptionally well. Get it? Cool.<br/><br/>So, where do the DT990's fit in?<br/>Power Requirements:<br/> It is worth noting that the 990's listed here are 250 ohms but there are other flavors. 250 ohms all but mandates an amp.  To my knowledge the Limited Edition all black ones are only available in 250 ohms. There are variants to the 990 that come as low as 32 ohm and as high as 600 ohm. If you go for the 32 ohm an amp should not be a necessity.<br/><br/>Construction:<br/>Very solid with a minor quibble. As near as I can tell there is one solid piece of spring steel for the headband that attaches to both ear-cups. The ear-cups are plastic but of the thick and sturdy variety. The cover on the headband is nice and squishy and has button snaps. So, it looks easy to replace if damaged. All the materials seem to be of great quality for a set at this price. Ear-pads are velour which is by far my very favorite option for ear-pads.<br/>Also, the DT990 are a very long lived and well loved set. The mfg. claims that nearly all parts are easily obtained and replaceable. Even though the upfront cost is more than some other options you can sleep well knowing that your set should last you many years to come.<br/>My one reservation is that it is not clear to me if the cord is replaceable. It has a standard strain relief. I have not searched or asked the mfg. about it. If it is indeed not replaceable, this might be cause for concern.<br/><br/>Comfort:<br/>Nice. I have a close shaved haircut but I barely notice the headband. Open sets with velour ear-pads breath and rarely get hot and sweaty. I have a smaller head than some humans. The clamping force is maybe one concern. For me it's just fine. If you have a large meaty head it is possible the clamp may be a bit much. The good news is that the spring-steel is fairly yielding and should be in no danger of losing shape over time.<br/><br/>Sound-stage:<br/> It is a very open sounding set. It's not on par with say AKG Q701's or the legendary AD700's but the DT990's offer a very respectable sound-stage of their own. Separation and positioning are very good. This makes the 990 a nice option for gaming just not the "best" option for competitive "sound whoring". (Pardon the phrase, I did not invent it)<br/><br/>Sonic Profile:<br/>This is a matter of taste of course but I am going to list it as a big plus for me. The DT990 has a sort of V shaped sound profile.<br/>There is some emphasis on both lows (bass) and highs (treble) with slightly recessed mids. This set makes no excuses for not being a neutral set but it pulls off an interesting feat. Open sets usually have weaker bass. So, the 990's crank it up a notch. The result is an open can with some punch.<br/>It also has great clarity of high frequencies thanks to the 990's slight emphasis on treble and open back. If all you want are X-Ray ears for online shooters you are better served with Q701's or the famous AD-700's. Compared to those options the DT990's represent a trade off of slightly less clarity and sound stage for a MUCH more satisfying bass response.<br/><br/>Recommended for:<br/>Solo listening: Open design offers no real isolation but when alone I will take the sound-stage of an open set any day of the week.<br/>Non-competitive gaming: Sonic profile is a lot of "fun" and sound-stage is great with Dolby or CMSS. If competitive gaming is ALL you want maybe get the AD700's instead.<br/>Bassy music tracks: Rap/Hip-Hop, DnB, Dubstep...etc. The "fun" sound of these cans offer a really great mix of traits for an open set. The 990's may not be neutral but when paired with material to match its strengths the rewards are great.<br/><br/>Not Recommended for:<br/>Privacy:  You may bothers others in the room because of leaking sounds.<br/>Travel: See above. Just forget about work or airplanes. They do not fold up or lay flat on the chest when taken around the neck like "DJ" headphones. Plus they all but require an amp with decent power. This is a set for at home.<br/>Movies/TV: Again, this is an open set geared for "fun". If you want neutral/accurate reproduction this is maybe not the best set.<br/><br/>A WORD ABOUT GAMING HEADPHONES<br/> I love to game. At least in part, my choices in headphones came by way of the massive review guide by a user called Mad Lust Envy over at Head-Fi. As far as a resource for headphone reviews revolving around gaming his sticky thread over at Head-Fi should be listed as a National Treasure. I would be remiss not give him a shoutout. If you are interested in gaming headphones and have not heard of the Mad Lust Envy Thread over at Head-Fi I strongly recommend a visit. Just be careful. The motto over there is something like "Welcome to Head-Fi! Sorry about your wallet."<br/>If you want to make a headset out of your headphones you could do a lot worse than the Antlion Mod-Mic. It has a magnetic mount. You can put magnetic mounts on more than one headphone allowing a lot of flexibility. It also works better than most dedicated headset mics. There is also a  good cheaper option form Zalman.<br/><br/>*Comparisons may be useful to those who are considering one of the other sets that I own. So, here it goes...*<br/>COMPARISONS:<br/>DT990 vs. AT-M50:<br/>  The M50's are a DJ Headphone that can be taken down around the neck and the cups will lay flat on your chest. M50's are closed back, do not leak much sound, they are easy to drive. The Bass is controlled and deep but not too muddy or overly intrusive. True Bass Heads that really just want their teeth to rattle may not be satisfied but I find them to be a real joy for Drum n' Bass, Dub Step or Rap/Hip Hop Tracks. That being said it is a closed back headphone and while the sound stage is not bad for a closed back, it is also not ideal for nit picking finer details in competitive games. Take all of these traits as a whole and what you have is my go-to cans for travel or when I don't want to bother others in the room with what I am listening to.<br/>  The 990's being open and power hungry (more on this later) are no good as portable cans. Where they impress is the fact that they have almost as much of a "fun" bass response as the M-50's. In open cans this is not typical. Being open and able to dig deep in bass is one of the traits that makes non-competitive gaming with 990's just awesome.  They have great bass response in an open design with better sound stage and detail retrieval. If I am alone at home I reach for the 990''s over the M50's. On the road or with the wife in the room it's the exact opposite.<br/><br/>DT990 vs. Q701:<br/>  Q701's are renowned for having a very wide open sound stage and high degree of clarity in the mids and highs. They are equally known for lacking in the bass department. Bass Heads need not apply. They are great for "detail whoring" in competitive online games or listening to fine details in less bass heavy music. X-Ray ears. The sound stage is truly a standout in this set but again many will left wanting for more bass. Also, a very comfy and well crafted set.<br/>  The DT990 stacks up quite well against the strong points of the Q701. They are very open though not quite on the same level of the sound stage of the Q701. Though it does put up an admirably large sound stage of its own. Both sets are comfort kings. The 990's may have less detail and sound-stage but the bass is much better.<br/><br/>DT990 vs. HD558:<br/>The 558's are comfy and open and have nice velour pads. They are more like semi-open. They have a good soundstage. The clarity across the spectrum is good with clear mids and highs and nice punchy bass that can get satisfyingly deep but not overly boomy. This is the most neutral of my sets.  They are also a low impedance can that is easy to drive and at about $150 they are a very easy set to recommend. I hope you are picking up that I really like the HD558's because for the price (IMHO) they are a solid all-rounder that won't break the bank. This is my go to set for movies and TV.<br/>The 990's sound-stage is improved over the 558's and by my estimation positioning in is also a bit better. As noted the Freq. response is more V-shaped in the 990's. The 558's are more neutral and the 990's are more "fun". So, the bass digs a bit deeper and the highs are a bit more detailed though the mids are slightly recessed. The 558's and 990's don't come different worlds the way that the M50's and Q701's do. Detail retrieval is very good. The 990's are a 250 ohm headphone and some sort of amp is pretty much mandatory. Depending on the source you may be able to drive them to a listenable level but a power starved driver will not respond the way it is meant to and the results will be underwhelming. The same is true of the Q701's.<br/>Also, the materials and craftsmanship of the  DT990 are noticeably more solid than the 558's. I'm not saying the 558's feel cheap, they do not, but the 990's are clearly built to last.<br/><br/> In closing:<br/> Take all of this with a grain of salt. This is all very subjective and your mileage may vary. You might try something and not feel the same way about it. There is no accounting for taste.<br/> I hope that at least someone out there was helped by this review. If you have any specific questions about one of these headphones I would be happy to share my thoughts if you care to hear them.<br/><br/>Happy listening,<br/><br/>-Heretic</span>

<span>Well, I once hated headphones but these phones are changing my mind.<br/><br/>Why did I hate headphones?<br/><br/>First of all, headphones are uncomfortable.  They're heavy, hot and clamp your head like a vise.  These are none of the above.  The DT-990 Pro 250 is light in weight with soft velour ear cups.  Since they don't have plastic ear cups that induce sweating, they don't feel hot.  The headband is tight enough but not too tight on my head (hat size 7 1/2).  It's a bit astonishing to me that these headphones feel as good as they do.<br/><br/>Another reason I hated headphones was the boxy sound that seems to emanate from the center of my skull.  A bit of research indicated to me that this condition is more likely to occur when using closed back headphones.  The DT-990 Pro 250 is an open back design.  The soundstage is broad.  Maybe not as broad as listening in a well laid-out room with precisely placed and designed speakers but the soundstage is open and broad enough for me to distinguish individual musical instruments and their position in reference to the overall musical program.  Again, I'm astonished at the openness of the sound field.<br/><br/>Finally, I hated headphones for the reason many others like them--the isolation involved.  I know there are other types of headphones available today that allow outside sounds to be heard but the only phones I had ever used in the past were those that tried to shut me off from the outside world.  Sometimes, being isolated is good.  But I prefer to be aware of what's happening around me.  The DT-990 Pro 250 headphones allow in enough environmental sounds to keep me connected but not enough to be distracting.  I want to know if the phone rings, someone knocks at the door, the dog barks or Mr. Murderous Home Invader is coming through the bedroom window.<br/><br/>I've only had these headphones for one day.  From what I've read on Amazon and on other websites, the sound of these phones will improve as they "burn in".  I've witnessed this sound improvement with time and use happening with stereo speaker systems and with two SACD players so I know it's possible.  But even without the break-in period, the DT-990 phones sound good to me.  Some reviewers complain of the mid-bass being overly boosted and the treble being too prominent.  I don't have golden ears but I don't find these characteristics present.  The design of the phones does color the musical programming somewhat but, in my opinion, this adds a little punch without going so far as to be obtrusive.<br/><br/>When the UPS guy delivered my package yesterday, I was listening to John Hiatt's "Dirty Jeans and Mudslide Hymns" CD.  It has typical bass heavy production, however, the headphones never sounded boomy at all and I could pick up details in the recording I had never noticed.  Since classical music is where I listen most closely, I then put on the RCA Living Stereo SACD of the Boston Pops doing "Gaite Parisenne".  There's lots of high frequency sounds on this recording but I never noticed any irritating, piercing treble out of the headphones.  Next I played another RCA Living Stereo SACD, Fritz Reiner conducting the Chicago Symphony in Dvorak's Symphony No. 9.  This is a superb full orchestra recording.  Again, I felt astonished at the details coming out in this CD through these headphones.  Today, I've listened to selections from Arthur Rubenstein's Chopin CD box set and Martha Argerich's EMI concerto box set.  The phones can pick up too much detail at times--I could detect foot tapping and breathing during one of the live Argerich performances.  But the pianos always sound natural, lively and forward if slightly lacking in warmth at times.  I expect "warmth" will develop with continued use.  I've also plugged the DT-990's into my Kindle Fire HD tablet and listened to parts of the MP3 of Nicola Benedetti's "Fantasie" compilation.  I know many feel MP3 is not true high fidelity, inferior to other downloadable formats as well as CDs.  Still, it's the direction recorded music is headed today and it can be entirely satisfying and enjoyable, especially when one listens with the DT-990s.  Ms. Benedetti's "Lark Ascending" sounds every bit as good to me on the MP3 through these headphones as it does from the original CD played over my B&amp;W home speakers.<br/><br/>Time will tell and many things can occur.  If I can remember, I will update this review over time with more on how these phones break in and how they perform long term.<br/><br/>UPDATE, July 6, 2013:<br/><br/>Well, those who said the phones would "burn in" knew what they were talking about.  I've barely used my home speakers since taking possession of these headphones in May and the sound has improved significantly.  They have definitely developed that "warmth" I was hoping for.  I enjoy listening to music more every time I use them.<br/><br/>There is one point I do dislike about these phones after extended use and familiarity with them.  They are not very aesthetically pleasing to my eye.  The brown plastic grid and white lettering on the exterior ear pieces of the Pro model really look kind of cheap and Mickey Mouse.  I guess it's a style that some might like but I'm not exactly joyous about it.  The other DT-990 models look a lot better, however, they cost considerably more and they are said to sound the same.  For the price difference, I would still buy the Pro model.  Can't see them when I'm wearing them anyway.</span>

<span>I've owned various Bose headphones, Audio-Technica ATH-M50x, Sennheiser HD 206s &amp; a few lesser known brands, and DT 990 Pro's are hands down the best headphones I've ever owned. Make no mistake, these babies do not produce a flat response; the highs and bass are boosted, although mids, while certainly crisp, are not as pronounced. Combined with an impressively wide soundstage, the result is an immersive, warm, 3-dimensional cascade of sonic bliss.<br/><br/>So far, I've listened to EDM, classical guitar, psychedelic rock and hip-hop, and I'm blown away by the fidelity. Every instrument truly has it's own space. I've even tried mixing some of my newer projects and am very pleased with the clarity these headphones provide.<br/><br/>Caveats: As other reviewers have noted, these are open ear headphones, meaning they ARE NOT noise cancelling. I would recommend them for use at home or in a quiet studio setting. Additionally, although the bass is definitely boosted, it isn't exactly skull-rattling either. That said, sub bass (40-60 Hz) is detectable and hip-hop still knocks. Lastly, some reviewers (on Amazon and elsewhere) complain that these headphones are too "bright." That is, the highs overpower everything else and result in ear fatigue. I disagree with this completely. Sure, the sound is on the "bright" side, but it doesn't detract from warmer tones in my experience.</span>

<span>The first headphones (or speakers) that I don't have to equalize (30 ohm)!  I have pitch perfect hearing and live/die on music in my life.  But never invested in good quality headphones before these (I generally like to feel my music though big speakers).  For the price these seem like a terrific value to me... the sound is SO good.  For listening to "Fine Music", I can't imagine anything better.  The sound is crisp, full, rich, bass is very solid, and every little nuance of sound comes through (shocked to hear sounds on my vinyl that I've never heard before!).  However, be aware these are STUDIO headphones; they are not designed to emphasize anything; they're flat spectrum.  So, if you want that razor-ripping sound from a heavy metal guitar as I do sometimes, these don't do that without some unusual EQ tweaking.  They don't distort... that's the great thing on most music, but that also means they don't sound like a rock concert or a Marshall amplifier in your living room.  But, I have gotten closer to that with some 20 band EQ.  Direct from my laptop they (30 ohm) are not loud enough for me, but might be sufficient for some people/purposes.  Using my Harman Kardon amp they are louder than I can handle.  I listen to all types of music and my favs like Enigma or Alan Parsons or Aretha (yea, old school, lol) is just dreamy with these headphones!  Oh... and the earcups are so soft and totally seal out room noise; very comfortable for up to 2-3 hours continuously for me.</span>

<span>I'm not an audio file or an audio expert but I've had my experiences with burro dynamic headphones before and I could say these are one of if not the best all around mid range headphones you can get for yourselves.<br/><br/>These are closed case so you get cleaner base and you can hear meds much clearer, however you can't hear any sounds outside so be complicated if you have somebody calling you.<br/><br/>Right off the gate you might have to do a little bit of adjusting with your EQ settings. personally I would recommend using high base and high boost and adjust from there. Even if you don't the overall audio quality is amazing<br/><br/>the overall structural design of the headphones are pretty tough and rugged. The headphone earpads are nice and soft and silky. I would be careful using them for prolonged periods of time, in humid areas, or if you're prone to sweating because they could start to mat and cause sorts of skin irritation.<br/><br/>5/5 these are the perfect all around headphones for under 150 bucks</span>

<span>Before getting these Beyerdynamics, I'd never spent more than $50 on a pair of headphones. Over the last thirty years, I've had headphones in that price category by Sennheiser, Koss, Audio-Technica, and Philips. For the last ten years, I've been unnecessarily content with a pair of Philips SBC HP250 32 ohm headphones. I've missed decades of opportunities to listen to quality sound because of this misplaced frugality. These DT770 Pro headphones resolve and clarify detail that in my previous headphones was a sonic blur.<br/><br/>Specifications: Beyerdynamic headphones are made in Germany. The DT770 Pro is available in 80 ohm and 250 ohm. These are the 250 ohm model. Frequency response on either model is 5 Hz to 35 kHz. They are closed back headphones, and the ambient noise attenuation is approximately 18 dbA. THD (total harmonic distortion) is less than 0.2% and nominal SPL (sound pressure level) is 96 dB. Their power handling capacity is 100 mW. The cable is 3 meters long, which is coiled on the 250 ohm model and straight on the 80 ohm model.<br/><br/>The coiled cable isn't long enough to wear the headphones and move far from the jack, so I've linked it to a </span>

<span> I bought after getting the phones. This allows me to sit or move around the room some distance from the jack, but I think now that a 15 foot extension would have been a better choice, since I don't like to overstretch the coils on the headphone cable. (This Mogami cable is heavy duty and I absolutely recommend it.)<br/><br/>These 250 ohm phones work fine without a headphone amp, plugged straight into my i3 Toshiba Satellite P745 laptop (year 2012 model). I do amplify them, though (because I already had the amp and they sound even better amped), with a (discontinued) Rane HC 4S headphone console.<br/><br/>Specs on the Rane amp: This is a four phone amp (actually four amps in one rolled steel, rack-mountable box) designed to take the output of a studio mixer (so it's not an audiophile amp). It takes two ¼ inch phone plugs (tip/ring) for input and then outputs to both a stereo 3.5mm mini jack or stereo ¼ inch stereo phone jack for each headphone (choose one per amp), and is switchable overall from stereo to mono. Each phone has its own volume control and LED overload indicator. The amp has output impedance of 1 ohm max and will drive phones from 32 to 600 ohms, taking them typically up to 120 dB SPL, with 200 mW minimum power for 32 to 150 ohm phones (with 75 ohm phones being optimum at 239 mW, and yielding 146 mW for 300 ohm phones). Frequency response is 10 Hz to 45 kHz (+0/-3 dB).<br/><br/>From the computer to the amp: I do not have a DAC between the computer and amp. To connect the laptop to the amp, I use a six foot long </span>

<span> with 3.5mm stereo plug to dual ¼ inch phone plugs, and plug it into the headphone jack of the laptop. This cable was designed for the iPod and is of higher quality (and more costly) than the three foot long Hosa cable I was using before this. (Sescom also makes cables with a 3.5 mm stereo plug going to two RCA plugs.) I use a right-angle 3.5mm female to 3.5mm male adapter at the headphone jack to protect the cable and jack from developing a short from the weight of the cable. As of this writing, I'm using an adapter from Radio Shack, but I might try a Hosa brand of the same type.<br/><br/>The first thing I did on getting the Beyerdynamics was to compare them, using the Rane amp, with the Philips SBC HP250 I've been using for years. The DT 770 at 250 ohms is softer in loudness than the 32 ohm Philips at the same volume setting, but not by much. The difference in clarity and sound quality, especially at high volume, is striking. I'll leave it to others to write about soundstage and presentation of low, mid, and high frequency ranges. I also use these phones with my ten-year-old Sony receiver, straight from the headphone jack, and they are an improvement over my previous headphones.<br/><br/>Software: On the laptop, I'm using JRiver Media Center (purchased) and VLC Media Player (free). I started out with foobar2000 (free) for audio, but JRiver is superior and worth the small expense. Media Monkey is another program I tested. It is also free unless you want the more advanced version. I highly recommend JRiver Media Center. I've set it as the default player for videos also, usurping VLC. However, VLC and foobar2000 (along with Irfan View for a picture viewer and simple image editor) are good programs that can replace the Windows media player with advanced features and without cost. They remain on my computer with shortcuts on my desktop. I use iTunes for iTunes U and nothing else.<br/><br/>These headphones sound good with this setup, although I suspect there is more quality to be had from them with better mediation between the audio's digital data and the headphones (i.e. audiophile grade DAC and amp, such as those available from Musical Fidelity, Burson, or Lehmann Audio, among many others.<br/><br/>I had to return the first pair of these headphones for a replacement before a month was past because the right side cut out. I got them from the Recording Store here at amazon and out in the physical world in New York. They sent me a phone number to call. I asked for a new pair (I really like these headphones), and they happily sent me a return label via email. I had the replacements via USPS Priority within a week (literally) of sending out the defective pair via UPS.

You'll hear the tune and pulse of the music in even the cheapest phones. It's up to you to decide how much you're willing to pay to hear more.

<span>I recently needed to replace my pair of over the ear headphones so I began my search for a good pair of headphones in the $150-$200 range. Immediately Senhiser, Beyerdynamic, and Audio‑Technica stood out. I first received a pair of the Audio‑Technica ATH M-50x which had good sound but were very uncomfortable if worn for more than an hour or so. Then I picked up a pair of the Beyerdynamic DT 770. These headphones had amazing sound quality and comfort but the passive sound isolation was mediocre at best. Which is why I ordered a pair of the Beyerdynamic Premium 990 which are open back. I figured that the sound quality and comfort would be similar but the open back quality would allow me to talk with others while I played music. Unfortunately the 990's had worse sound quality than the 770 (a bit harsher sounding and not as clear) and were very uncomfortable even after only a couple of hours. During this time I also ordered a pair of Senhiser HD 599 headphones. While these headphones have a significantly different sound signature than the others I have tried, they were of similar quality. Overall the HD 599's were slightly less comfortable than the 770's but the open back quality was convenient and the sound was quite nice. I would have been satisfied with the HD 599's but they were the only pair of headphones I could not drive with my desktop. They produced terrible static. This did not occur when I used the 599's on other devices or when I used other headphones (even those with similar impedance and SPL) driven by my desktop computer. This prevented me from keeping them. I have attached a breakdown of my thoughts below:<br/><br/>------------Sound Quality------------<br/><br/>Beyerdynamic DT 770 (80 Ohm) - Winner<br/>Highs - Quite good representation, much cleaner than Senhiser<br/>Mids - Quite good representation<br/>Lows - A little closed sounding but overall they are handled well<br/>Overall this is how the music should sound. They perform the most similar to my pair of Martin Logan Motion 15's (bookshelf speakers)<br/><br/>Beyerdynamic Premium 990 (32 Ohm)<br/>Highs - Similar to the 770's but rather harsh sounding<br/>Mids - Nothing special, no major issues<br/>Lows - Not as powerful as the 770's but more spacious. Seemed a bit washed out due to the open back design<br/><br/>Senhiser HD 599 (50 Ohm) - Close 2nd Best<br/>Highs - Not quite as poppy as they should be. They are a bit muted in the sound signature which can make them less fatiguing than other, more analytical, headphones.<br/>Mids - A bit to high level for me, it tended to make punk rock music sound very close and muddied<br/>Lows - A bit boomy but very spacious<br/><br/>Audio Technica ATH M-50x<br/>Highs - Quite good representation, a bit cold though<br/>Mids - Nothing special, no major issues though<br/>Lows - Too over-emphasized<br/><br/>-----------------Comfort---------------<br/><br/>Beyerdynamic DT 770 - Winner<br/>Perfect. I wore these on multiple occasions for more than 7 hours and never noticed any pressure points or discomfort. The headband is larger than average to distribute the pressure. The clamp pressure is also a bit more than average but this was not an issue due to the soft, replaceable, ear pads.<br/><br/>Beyerdynamic Premium 990<br/>I could not wear these for more than a few hours. The headband is made of a much harder material than the 770's and causes a painful pressure point on the top of my head. I believe this is made worse by the lower clamping force since more of the weight is on the top of your head.<br/><br/>Senhiser HD 599<br/>I could wear these for several hours as long as I moved them around every 30-40 minutes. More comfortable than the 990's. Significantly less clamping force than the 770's.<br/><br/>Audio Technica ATH M-50x<br/>These were the least comfortable. I could only stand to wear them for an hour or so before I had to take them off. All of the discomfort came from the top of my head.<br/><br/>----------------Usability---------------<br/><br/>Beyerdynamic DT 770<br/>These come with a permanently attached 10ft cable.

To me this is the best option since I dont have to lug around a long cable or risk losing extra cables. With that being said, it also came with a ~ 9ft straight cable and 3ft straight cable if the coiled cable is too much for you.</span>

<span>For my head, these are decently comfortable for extended periods of time.<br/><br/>Cord and connectors seem of good quality.<br/><br/>Sound is good overall for the price. I wouldn’t use these for mixing or any critical setting, but they are pleasant to listen to music to on an iPhone or whatnot.<br/><br/>Sound is a bit scooped out in parts of the midrange, and the very top octave is down a bit. Basically sounds like a “smiley” curve with a larger peak around 10kHz, before dropping off again.<br/><br/>Mid/upper bass is hence a little warm, but they do extend down to 25-30Hz or so. The 32Hz note on “Temple Caves” Planet Drum is clearly audible, 15Hz in Photek’s “Seven Samurai” is not (which one would have a hard time “hearing” anyway, bass that low is mostly felt).<br/><br/>Imaging “depth” is not bad, but not comparable to the best. A little flat.<br/><br/>Actual clarity is decent (hearing the details, low perceived distortion), but can sound mistakenly muffled sometimes because of the lower amplitude response in the midrange. This works in it’s favor at lower volume levels where the bass range would otherwise begin to sound weaker, of course then details get drowned out by background noises.<br/><br/>For $20-30, a pleasant sounding set of headphones. Easy to enjoy.</span>

The Neumann NDH 20 is a closed-back headphone combining excellent isolation with the carefully balanced sound image and outstanding resolution you'd expect from a Neumann product. The NDH 20 is thus ideally suited to monitoring and mixing tasks, even in loud and noisy environments. Circumaural memory foam ear pads offer high long-term comfort. 150Ohm headphone amp recommended.

<span>Fell in love with Neumann microphones 40 years ago... Not at all disappointed with the sound of these “cans” out of the box. During my first couple of hours of listening, I tried some of my own self-produced electronic music (“am0eba” and “epiphany algorithm”), as well as commercial recordings from artists including Garbage, Soul Coughing, old and new King Crimson, BT, Imogen Heap, Alanis Morrisette, Mike Doughty, Mike Oldfield, Yes, Peter Gabriel, Talking Heads, Pop Will Eat Itself, Ned’s Atomic Dustbin, Jesus Jones, and others, as well as excerpts from classical recordings including: Stravinsky, Tchaikovsky, Rimsky-Korsakov (yeah, I like Russian symphonic stuff), Glass, and Hovahness... In almost every case, I was able to play at higher amplitude without discomfort or ear fatigue, and lower amplitude without losing the sounstage or coherence in a complex piece. I also was able to isolate individual instrumental lines and hear the individual elements of composite sounds - also without losing the sense of ensemble - and these are all extremely familiar recordings to me... The headphones are heavier than I’m used to (my other frequent-use headphones are Audio Technica ATH M50’s, Grado Sr80i’s, Yamaha HPH MT8’s and Sony MDR 7506’s. I also own a pair of KRK 8400’s, but really dislike them), but again, were not uncomfortable at all. One review that I saw mentioned microphonics from the cable, but I certainly have not noticed this when using the coily cord (haven’t yet tried the straight cord), although I have been annoyed by this with my KRK’s... I also haven’t yet tried running the NDH20’s directly from my iPhone, but I note that from my JBL M-Patch Active-1 monitor control’s headphone output, the sensitivity doesn’t seem far off from my Sony’s or Yamaha’s... Will update my review after more hours of use, in case there is a substantial burn-in effect... Will also try them direct from my phone. So far, not in any way disappointed, despite the high price!<br/><br/>Took away 1 star due to price.<br/><br/>Update: 2 days later...<br/>Have continued to use these headphones in multi-hour listening sessions without fatigue or discomfort. Have run them from my iPhone 6+ without feeling like I ran out of volume... I note Amazon “recommends” use of a dedicated headphone amp with these, probably due to the slightly higher than usual impedance of 150 ohms, but for casual (even loud) listening, they are plenty sensitive enough to make use of the phone’s built-in audio... An external headphone amp might make them sound better, but is certainly not necessary. I have noticed some mechanical noise from touching the outer structure of the headphones while monitoring at lower volumes, but still nothing like the mechanical cable noise from my KRK’s. Will update again after more listening and break-in, but I’m very happy with these headphones. (Now just drop the price by $100, and you’ll get my 5th star!)<br/><br/>2nd update (1 week later):  Finally found a couple of weaknesses: Mechanical noise from moving the cable... Yep, if you wear them in such a way as to allow the cord to brush up against other objects and you move around while listening, you may hear mechanical noise transmitted into the phones... So far, it seems easy to avoid. Second thing is I had them on for an extended listening session last night and finally noticed a little discomfort - I had not placed the earpieces carefully enough and allowed one cushion to press against the outer part of my pinnae - it hurt a little. I readjusted the cushion so that my ear was entirely enclosed and the pain subsided. Still feel as though the sound is burning in, but I'm not convinced that's really a thing... I think I'm just getting used to listening through them and so I'm noticing different things... Definitely my favorite pair of headphones!</span>

<span>I do EDM genre mixing and mastering, and these are the end-game when it comes to clarity, dynamic range, and response. I read some of the reviews on here before ordering and paid close attention to others who indicated they do mastering, and I'm glad I did. These are it. Period. The sound stage is absolutely mind blowing. Very wide, very deep, and there's zero latency and absolute clarity to sounds. (No "mushiness", which is critical to precise editing)<br/><br/>The frequency response is outstanding. Whether it's subs at the far bottom end rattling your brain (which my last expensive headphones couldn't even render at all) or the absolute high end of the audio spectrum, it's got it. I wouldn't say it's perfectly "flat" across the entire audio spectrum, no headphones are, but it's the closest you are going to get without calibrated, matched studio monitors. For guys like me stuck home during a pandemic doing mastering, with kids and other noise, the sound isolation these provide, and the sound stage and clarity, makes these headphones worth their weight in gold.<br/><br/>So stop second guessing yourself and just pull the trigger on them. They are THAT good, from an audio perspective. Be aware that they may not be the most comfortable headphones - I have big ears and wear glasses, they're a tight fit - but they are absolutely solid for the job they need to do for me and I'm willing to put up with a bit of a tight fit for this astonishing level of audio quality. If you are looking for something ultra-comfortable for casual listening, maybe look elsewhere; if you are looking for professional grade precision and clarity and have a job to do... well, these are it.</span>

<span>Bought this to use for mixing in my studio at night when I'll wake up the family with the big Adam audio monitors. They're a bit heavy, a bit squeezy, but sit comfortably over the ears with nice, thick foam-ish material. They do get hotter than my Beyerdynamic DT 700 pros, but they also sound much nicer. Comes with two cables, a straight and coiled, and I prefer the coiled to keep my workstation as clear as possible. They feel and look super high quality, and with just as high quality audio I can't complain. Well, the one complain I do have is that the headband feels too wide to sit comfortably on top of the head, and while they do fit snugly over the ears, they can slide forward/off when bending down. Price and all other things considered though, as a producer, I love them and these are my new daily workhorses. I also love using these for streaming TV/Movies as well because they just sound so clear and give more liveliness to everything compared to the BDs. I suspect it will be hard to beat the sound quality of these for the price...</span>

<span>So good! They don’t overhype any particular frequency range. They block out most room noise. Love these for all purposes including music, gaming, movies. I own a few other midrange headphones and these are my go to for everything! They are fairly comfortable. The earpads feel great. I’ve tried replacing them with 3rd party pads but the sound degrades. The stock pads are the best pads…except they are poorly stitched. In just a year daily use (bedroom use, no traveling), BOTH pads’ stitching detached and the foam inside popped out. Stock pad replacements were impossible to find at online retailers and was a PITA through Sennheiser due to backorder and very slow shipping. Also expensive around $60 for something that should last a lot longer than a year! If you can’t love without these headphones you may want to order an extra set of earpads in advance. Otherwise be prepared to wait up to 2 months for replacements when you need it…</span>

<span>Build quality not the best but the 'phone was very light. Not as clampy as the Sr950 and was comfortable. The velour pads came on the headphone and were pretty comfortable,  more so than the pleather.<br/>Sound was outstanding for the price! The clarity was excellent and the bass was tight and punchy, but not overblown. I actually had several instances when<br/>the sound seemed to come from the ourside, that's how good the soundstage was. The 990 is a great choice if you enjoy listening to music.</span>

<span>Un-equalized, I compared Oneodio's Monitor 80 to my HiFiMan HE400-X4 in comparative response measurements and with a variety of music from YouTube including Dietrich Fischer-Diekau's live "Winterreise" with Brendel; "Muddy Waters Sings Big Bill Broonzy",  Rhoda Scott's Hammond Christmas album, a lively and well recorded period pianoforte performance of the 3rd movement from Beethoven's "Moonlight Sonata", a closed mic-ed duet of tabla and harmonium,  drumkit and cymbals.<br/><br/>Unequalized, HE400-X4 lacked lower pitch and decay definition on a Steve Maxwell video with a little Fibes drumkit paired with very large cymbals.  Its lean nature lost the pitch bend on the floor tom and also the color of the 30 inch cymbals.  I assume that applying APO/Peace EQ to HE400 would improve things but not everyone is set up for or bothers with elaborate equalization of headphones.<br/><br/>Soundstaging seems pretty accurate in the panoramic field and without the two "holes" or "lobes" experienced with closed back cans.  I did not directly compare it to my SHP9500 but suspect the Oneodio may do some things better.<br/><br/>Oneodio's Monitor 80 is set to go without EQ for average listening and very dynamic on that Youtube video pianoforte example of the Moonlight's "Presto Agitato";<br/><br/>It resolves pretty much what's happening in various recordings.  In contrast, my<br/>HE400X4 can get rough on some older recordings of the female voice.<br/><br/>Look at the comparative graphs attached and you can see the balance differences<br/><br/>The included case is good enough and functional.  Build quality seems sturdy and overall<br/>appearance "nice"<br/><br/>All in all Oneodio showed they know how to design competent drivers and tune a headphone.<br/><br/>btw - I hope this capitalizes correctly - I know how to hit the "shift key" but Amazon renders my questions in lower case - lol</span>

<span> I have these OneOdio headphones plugged in to my Solid State Logic SSL 2 audio interface. If you intend to use them for mixing, I’d say the 250-ohm resistance is a must, and these have it. Also, greasing the hinged parts to prevent the creaking is also important because you want to hear the audio, not plastic rubbing on plastic. Considering that these headphones have a good, flat sound, and the cost of other 250-ohm headphones, these headphones are worth their price. The open back construction means you can immerse yourself in your work or hobby without losing awareness of other things. I’d recommend using these through an audio interface/mixer of some sort, or a headphone amp.<br/><br/>There are two different cables included, providing some flexibility to how you connect your headphones. The case is also nice to have if you transport your headphones from one place to another, or you travel frequently.<br/><br/>As I mentioned, the hinges that hold the ears to the headband are a bit creaky and noisy. They were better after lubricating them with some grease (see video), but you wouldn’t expect to need to do that at any price level. I only saw one other mention of this in the reviews, so maybe it’s not a common issue, or maybe others didn’t take note of it? I can’t really say, but I haven’t had to do this to any other headphones I’ve owned, even other budget ones. It’s a bit disappointing, but for $99 250-ohm resistance headphones, I can deal with taking a few minutes to grease the hinges.<br/><br/>Overall, they sound good, they’re lightweight, and they’re a bargain. If you need some studio headphones on a budget, and you can deal with potentially needing to grease the hinges, these might be the headphones for you.</span>

<span>I've been using these headphone for a little over a week now and I do like them they're are just a little different than what I'm used to which is for listening to music I'm not using these for any audio production so I can't give advice on that front these are open back by the way so sound isolation is non existent so you'll hear everything around you and those around you will hear what your listening to. Firstly the comfort is just about average there's more comfortable options from Philips and maybe Grado in this price category but these do have features those other options don't. One thing that initially bothered me is the earcup rotates completely I believe this is due to the headphones being geared to monitoring and in that sense it makes sense to have the rotating earcup but in my case I had to adjust the earcup to fit my ear every time I put them on which you get used to after a few times but its something I've never had to do since other headphones I have don't have fully rotating ear cups.  The weight of the headphone is also heavily concentrated on the headband which has virtually no padding so all the weight is felt on the center of the band the ear cups have virtually no pressure but also very little padding on the earcups which kind of works since all the weight is on the headband so if you often find too much pressure on your temples this may be for you. Luckily  the headphones are pretty light so the weight isn't to noticeable on your head. You get two cables a coiled cable with a standard 3.5 to quarter inch jack and a standard cable with 3.5 to 3.5 you don't get a separate quarter inch to 3.5mm adapter. There's also a really nice hard case which I've never seen in a headphone at this price point which was a nice addition. The sound is good I don't have any headphones in this price point so I had to compare it to the two headphones I currently use which are the hd 650 and the sundara and although the prices don't match it it's what I had and these headphones don't sound as good as either but it's not bad either I actually enjoyed listening to this and that's a win for this price when comparing with the hd 650 I immediately noticed the bass on monitor 80 was much more present which isn't a surprise since the 650 is a midrange focused headphone but it was enjoyable to hear a non recessed bass not to say this is bass heavy its not at all but it is present in my opinion. I don't have a frequency graph for this headphone but I'd say its more a U shape sound signature with the bass and highs slightly more prominent than the midrange which is ok I much prefer this U signature to the highly popular V sound signature. Overall I liked this headphone it was a welcome change and I really enjoyed using it the build quality seems like it'll last and I'd recommend getting this if you want an open back.</span>

<span>For the price, these are perfect for a casual listen. I gave a pair each to my kids and I use mine for video editing. They're not reference headphones, or even close to it, but when I'm on the road, I don't really need more and don't want to take the space up carrying my Sony MDR-7506 set.<br/><br/>I really like that the cord comes out of just one side. This prevents catching it on things and is in general more comfortable. There are very few if any other headphones in this price range that have this feature.<br/><br/>The cord is short compared to other headphones I own but for sitting a desk with a laptop or iPad, it's the perfect length.</span>
