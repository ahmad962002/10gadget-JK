<span>This camera is a great starter camera. I used it as my starter and it is amazing. The focus, 4K shots, nightime view, quality, and zoom is amazing if you're starting out. It produces great photos for a long time. The battery life could be longer but that doesn't take away from how amazing this camera has been for me. 5 Stars. 100% reccomend to starters and/or sports photographers</span>

<span>I purchased this camera after purchasing a Lumix FZ1000Mk2, to compare the two. The FZ300 was US$300 cheaper, and I wondered if I could get by with it instead of the FZ1000Mk2. I found the form factor to be a bit small for my larger hands, and didn't really care for the zoom control on the lens barrel. There have been some instances "in the wild" of the zoom lever surrounding the shutter release failing, so having a secondary zoom control is good, but this one seemed somewhat vague.<br/><br/>My background is a series of digital point and shoot cameras going back to the Agfa 1250. I've had perhaps 10-12 digital cameras since that time, culminating in the Sony Alpha 900, with a complete, and I mean complete, kit of Minolta lenses for that body. That said, I got to the point where dragging along a backpack of lenses and filters to be more than I wanted. My Lumix LX5 and LX7 languished in a drawer, the iPhone 10Xr had taken on more and more photography duties, but it in itself let me down on many occasions, especially in low light.<br/><br/>I ended up getting the Canon G5X Mk2 as a new pocket camera with a better zoom range than the LX7. What I needed along with that was a super-zoom bridge camera to take the place of the lenses I was giving up with the Sony A900, and the furthest reach I had with that kit was an f8 500mm reflector...<br/><br/>In the end, I found that neither the FZ300 or the FZ1000Mk2 really met my needs and settled on the FZ2500, which while still a very good camera for stills, has a more impressive video capability, even though that is secondary to my needs. The FZ2500 has a weight and size that feels better to me, the ergonomic feel more like a traditional interchangable lens camera, and it will record video only limited by battery and memory capacity.<br/><br/>The FZ300 is a VERY capable camera, and it is a favorite among people who shot birds. The 1/2.3" sensor gives it better optical zoom reach. In the end, I wanted the larger camera and a 1" sensor to match the Canon. so the FZ300 was returned along with the FZ1000Mk2.<br/><br/>That said, I did recommend the FZ300 to my son-in-law as a Christmas gift for my daughter, and I believe she will be happy with it. Indeed, I think for anyone wanting something that is a huge step up from a smart phone, in a fairly light package (600+ grams) with weather sealing will appreciate this camera. It simply wasn't right for me.</span>

<span>My husband and I relocated to Michigan this past spring and it didn’t take long to realize that my I Phone11 camera was woefully  inadequate when it came to capturing the beauty of the Upper Peninsula! I did my homework (lots of reviews from several sources!) and settled on the Panasonic LUMIX FZ300. It’s my first ‘real’ camera and I love it!<br/>There is a bit of a learning curve if you’re a beginner, I got it in May and I’m still learning how to use all the settings, but there are YouTube videos by Graham Houghton that are very helpful! The zoom is, in my opinion, incredible, the picture I took of the frog eating a minnow is amazing…you can see the grains of sand on his fingers! I had no idea that frogs even HAD fingers! It was worth every penny!</span>

<span>This camera is my first camera ever (other then my phone). To say I’m absolutely in love with this camera is a under statement. Ever photo I’ve taken so far has came out crystal clear! The little things around my house including my kitten that with a phone doesn’t pop much absolutely come to life! I bawled when my camera came in. I have been scraping up every penny to be able to save up for this camera and I’m so happy I did. One thing I do wish it came with was a lense protecter. I have seen mentions of uv lense protecters that are supposed to be absolutely wonderful. If you do get this camera save a little extra to get one. Once I can save up I’m getting me one. It is a super easy camera to learn especially for beginners. It is not heavy at all, which comes in handy for if you are doing long photo shoots. Another thing I wish it came with was a camera cleaner. Or things that told you what was safe to clean the camera with. Obviously not water but are glasses cleaners safe? Or is there a specific camera cleaner? Not sure but other then that I’m beyond happy!</span>

<span>Bought this for our granddaughter as her first non-iphone camera.  She is thrilled with it so far.  It has a fully automatic program mode that allowed her to begin shooting good looking photos immediately.  She loves horses and has been using the camera to take photos and videos.  Yet the camera has many advanced features like a serious telephoto zoom, full manual, aperture preferred, shutter preferred modes, and much more.  Nice touch screen to allow easy access to menu options.  At this price, it seems like a very good deal.</span>

<span>I have a few cameras and I’ve been using digital cameras since the 90s. Most of them are fairly similar and user-friendly. I’ve only been using it for two months and I’ve already had a lot of problems setting it for macro and for close-up shots. If you go into the settings and start changing things you’ll notice that there is so many settings that you really don’t need or would never thing to use. I don’t want to have to take a course to use a simple digital camera. Even though I have taken a course! As with most digital products it’s all in the software. I would say this has a poor user interface and confusing directions and you can blame it all on the software. I’ve taken some very beautiful pictures with this. But I’ve also spent hours trying to figure out why it won’t focus on macro. If you just want a Camera to take nice shots I would probably steer clear of this one. Get a Nikon.</span>

<span>We purchased this camera for work purposes and have to say, it does do the job. I was able to zoom a pretty good distance (more than what is actually needed). The flash is not the best BUT after walking the property and taking random photos - the camera did pick-up lowlight areas and did brighten the scene, so the photo did come out clear and brighter. I wouldn't recommend this camera for a person who is experienced and is used to a more sophisticated DSLR camera as it would be a disappointment to you. This is great for someone wanting to learn how to take photos and doesn't want to carry multiple lenses around at the same time. Although these cameras were purchased for work, I did catch some pretty nice shots. The main caveat I will say is the LINK123, APP. Unfortunately, the app does not always function when you want it to. Also, it would be nice to be able to open the app without syncing your camera to view older saved photos in your camera gallery.<br/><br/>Overall, if you would like an introductory camera with pretty neat options - I would recommend this camera.</span>

<span>I bought this camera for $209 for a vacation I was planning. I think it is good to rate an object proportionately. For example, it is not realistic to expect SLR results from a $200 camera, which I was tempted to do, because of my (high) expectations.<br/>This is a wonderful camera for its price. The pictures are very clear (I am very demanding when it comes to pictures, but I want a simple camera to use for a short period), especially if you use the Automatic setting. The videos are very good. The automatic resolution is set to 1280; so, if you want a 1080 resolution, you have to change it. Over all, this a good camera and I love it.</span>

The camera does not allow me to set a maximum ISO while shooting in scene mood.  I am not sure if this is a glitch in their software and it is inconvenient at times.

<span> I have been a user of both Nikon and Canon over the past 3-4 years and made the switch to sony in August of 2017. The a7iii is by far the best camera I have used on these three platforms. I previously owned and still use the Sony a6300 which was great for a budget camera but had tons of issues for someone who shoots professionally. I primarily shoot weddings and sports but also do commercial level work on the side. The photos I have provided are my first test of the a7iii in a somewhat warm climate doing both photo and video.<br/><br/>Improved Features:<br/>1. IN CAMERA PROXIES... no one talks about this on youtube!!<br/>2. dual card recording ability, dual writing ability<br/>3. HLG color space, no overheating<br/>4. Bright and Beautiful monitor, focus peaking, customizable buttons, uncompressed RAW photo capability, a large buffer depending on card size, and great autofocus with eye AF and face tracking... plus better "color science." Color science means absolutely nothing unless you are delivering a final image or video straight out of the camera, its all subjective and if you want Accurate colors Sony is the way to go. I could rant for pages about "color science."<br/>5. Headphone Jack... Monitoring external audio is absolutely important if you are running wireless mics. I will use this to monitor my wedding ceremony Audio.<br/><br/>Things that could be improved:<br/>1. The EVF is not calibrated color wise to match the display screen on the back of the camera... not a huge deal for video but it can get annoying for photo. Know your settings well enough to get you close in photos, and the RAW capabilities in Lightroom will give you some leeway.<br/>2. No face tracking while using an external recorder AND recording in Camera. If you record solely on the external recorder you can still retain face tracking which is not a huge deal, there is an option in the settings but it turns the external screen black.<br/>3. only 1 UHS-II slot. I would love to see two of them.<br/>4. no 10-bit color depth... this is probably coming on the a7siii which I understand, but it would be incredible to get a firmware update on the a7iii, a7riii, and a9 to allow 10-bit color, making SLOG  and HLG way easier to expose for and work with in post. Also, it allows creators to keep their a7iii and purchase an a7siii to match perfectly with it.<br/>5. The shutter button is a little spongy... not a huge complaint here because I am being rather critical<br/><br/>The a7iii has improved almost all of the issues thus far I have experienced with Sony APS-C Cameras. In my example photos and videos, I used the 70-200 f/2.8 GM (incredible lens). The a7iii lasted 4.5 hours of continuous video and photo shooting to two different SD cards with a completely bright viewfinder and screen with 20% battery to spare... something I could only dream of on the 6300. This is absolutely a professional camera and is reasonably priced for the features it has.<br/><br/>if you are looking for a prosumer camera with pro features... you can't go wrong with the a7iii. It definitely is not a cinema camera but will absolutely serve me well until I need to upgrade in the future for both photo and video.</span>

<span>I am a Semi Pro and have been for more than 15 years now. I have the 5DII &amp; III and decided to get the R instead of the 5D IV for a couple of reasons.  First I'm getting older and I wanted something more compact to walk around with and second, I didn't want to sacrifice image quality by downsizing.  Since I already have a significant investment in EF-L lenses the EOS R with the ring adapter seemed to be the perfect way to go without investing in a whole new and unfamiliar system.<br/>  As my title states - I have ZERO regrets. I bought the R with the RF 24-105 f4 IS lens and a the Canon Control Ring Mount Adapter for my EF-L lens lineup. The RF 24-105 that I got with my R is the quickest focusing, tack sharp lenses I have ever owned. The IS gives me at least 3 stops to play with in low light. In my tests I can easily shoot 1/40th hand held no problem.  All of my EF-L lenses work flawlessly with the adapter - Thank you Canon!<br/>  Images are beautiful with very good performance in low light, high ISO, with very usable images up to 8000 ISO even though I rarely go over 6800 ISO.<br/>  The controls (buttons &amp; dials)  are very customizable and I have even found a good setup for the hated touch bar that the critics keep bagging on.<br/>  So in short - the haters can keep on hating but I love my Canon EOS R.</span>

<span>The EOS R + 24-105mmm kit is replacing my 5D Mark III + 24-105mm kit.<br/><br/>The first thing you notice when you pick up the camera is that both the body and the native lens are noticeably lighter than the 5D Mark III kit. The body is very easy to hold, fits firmly in the hand. The LCD is bright and clear, even in daylight, and the touch controls are incredibly intuitive to use, you can tap to focus, navigate menus using your finger, pinch zoom, like on a phone.<br/><br/>The eye detection autofocus is especially helpful with wide aperture lenses like the 85mm F/1.4. Due to the very shallow depth of field, even a slight movement can throw the eye out of focus. You can easily end up focusing on the nose or ears with the eyes blurred. With the 5D Mark III, it was a challenge to get close shots with wide apertures right. The EOS R focuses on the eyes accurately pretty much every time. Out of the 100+ portrait shots I took over the holidays, less than 5 were out of focus. Even shots taken by others with no DSLR experience were focused perfectly, which I couldn't say about the 5D. As a bonus, eye detection works even with cats and dogs, as the attached photo attests.<br/><br/>Despite the higher resolution, the camera performs well at high ISOs. The attached photo was shot at ISO 4000, F/2.0, 1/60s, 85mm, at dim lighting. You will notice that color accuracy is excellent and noise is barely noticeable.<br/><br/>I love the control ring on RF 24-105 lens, which I programmed to adjust exposure compensation quickly. It is too bad that the control ring adapter was not available at the time when I bought the kit.<br/><br/>Since I always shoot raw, I appreciate the fact that there is a raw-only mode (no JPEGs) and images are saved at a more efficient compressed raw format. Despite the higher resolution, the .CR3 files are smaller than the Mark III's CR2s.<br/><br/>What I really miss on this camera is an analog mode dial.<br/><br/>As for the touch bar, I did my best practice and learn how to use it productively, but failed. I consider it a gimmick that I will likely never master.<br/><br/>Although I already have a GH5 for video, I did some experimenting with the video mode on the EOS R. One nasty surprise was that the SD cards I had, which easily handle 4K/10-bit video (150Mbit) on the GH5 were not fast enough for the Canon, even though in IPB  mode the bitrate should be only 120Mbit. I need to stick with HD for now.<br/><br/>With the EF-EOS R mount adapter, all 7 of my existing EF lenses, even non-Canon ones, work flawlessly. I am really glad that Canon made the new RF mount backward-compatible.</span>

<span>Canon makes a lot of "Prosumer" level cameras and with the USA Vs. International branding it can get very confusing.<br/>For me it came down to the following "Have to have" points:<br/><br/>24 MegaPixel resolution:<br/><br/>24Mpx allows me to take one product picture and still have enough resolution to zoom in on a portion of the frame and still have Amazon spec (3k x 3k px) image size (resolution). I have an older Rebel (from the late 2000, plus a Rebel SL1 that I borrowed and an Equivalent Nikon from the mid-2010s. This is the only camera that allows me to take a single product picture and still have sufficient resolution to post on Amazon and other places. With the other cameras even the RAW version was not large enough to satisfy Amazon requirement for picture size (so I had to upsample my pictures) after allowing for a modicum of cropping. With the SL1 and the Nikon, I had to take 2 to 3 additional pictures to have a decent resolution sample of the product's smaller features. My old Rebel is about as useful as a hole in the head these days. A shame. This camera is amazing when it comes to that.<br/><br/>Hinged Touchscreen:<br/><br/>The older SL1 Rebel is a nice camera, but feels cheaper and it has a fixed LCD screen. Since I shoot many products on the floor, with the camera at 90 degrees, being able to tilt the LCD screen for framing saves me time and resolution. I can close in tighter than I can with the SL1 because I can see the product better.<br/>Even handheld shooting reminds me of the old days with my Rolleifles and Hasselblad. I don;pt kn ow how much fre hand photography I'll do, but being able to get a lower POV without thrashing on the floor is nice. I remember spending $500 many years ago just to have a periscope viewfinder on an old Minolta film camera I used at the time. This is better.<br/><br/>Wi-Fi/Bluetooth connection:<br/><br/>This is the first thing I tested when I activated the camera and it works great. It lets me name pictures with a handy YY-MM-DD-filename format, which keeps all my pictures in Chronological order and they go into a folder properly named directly on my computer. With the Nikon I could do the same thing using an Open Source program, but I had to connect with a USB cable and frankly having one less cable in the studio is a blessing. Especially a cable connecting my laptop to the camera since I am continuously moving from behind the computer to the stage to place new products on it. I don't know if I'll use the bluetooth to my phone, but my wife might and it's nice to have.<br/>BTW, another thing I bought is a 2 batteries charger so now I have 3 batteries ready to go at all times. It's must for serious shooting.<br/><br/>18-55mm Lens:<br/><br/>I almost didn't buy a camera with a lens, because I already have a legacy of Canon lenses, including one that at the time cost me about three times what I paid for the camera body.<br/>I wasn't thrilled about the 18-55mm lens because it is the same as the one on the borrowed SL1. It's actually useful for some of the shooting I am doing these days, but the lens feels cheap. The manual focusing ring on the SL1 lens felt like a cheap plastic toy that came with a happy meal.<br/>GOOD NEWS: when I received the new camera, sporting the exact same lens, I was thrilled to find that in this new lens the focusing ring behaves much better. While the other lens' focusing ring spins with almost no friction, the one that came with my camera is smooth and offers just enough resistance for proper manual focusing. I do wish it was a bit wider, but it's a lot wider than other lenses I have and it's very useful. I don't know if I got lucky or what, since as best I can tell, they are identical lenses, but the one that came with this camera has excellent manual focusing.<br/>All in all, I made a good choice because I can work with this lens for some of the shooting I do. I needed another 50mm equivalent lens like I need a third eye. I have a collection of them. Having this zoom is going to make my life easier and save me time when shooting many products one after the other.<br/><br/>Stability Control:<br/><br/>Sometimes I have to shoot hundreds of products in a short time. While I have a pretty good tripod setup, it's in a small, hot room with lots of cables, lights reflectors, etc. I always shoot at 200 ISO, maybe 400 on a bad day so the exposure tends to be wide open and shutter speed very long.<br/>Well, the stability control on all my lenses (of the digital generation) is very impressive. I had to shoot a number of T-shirts very quickly and given that it was 110 degrees inside the room, I simply could not bother to set up the tripod and do the usual "Leopard military walk" to change subject, align them, etc.<br/>I decided to shoot them handheld. I was always good at it, but in this case I need to do it with my arms extended and the camera pointing down. Shutter speed 1/15. Crazy. Anything below 1/60 looks like a drunk was behind the lens.<br/>I thought "no way I could end up with a sharp picture" with that setup, but I did. Even with the older SL1 (and no tilting LCD) I tested the handheld and tripod mounted version of the same picture side by side. Obviously, the tripod mounted one had better depth of field so it was as sharp as it could be, but I could only tell the difference if I enlarged things like the stitching of a coat. Once compressed and uploaded to a web site, the difference was not only negligible, it was invisible.<br/>I am adding more lights so I can use a faster shutter speed, but I know that push come to shove, I can handhold the camera at 1/15 and get very sharp pictures. The Smithsonian may not be calling me anytime soon, but these pictures are not for museums.<br/><br/>Video:<br/><br/>This is the only disappointment, but not really a critical problem since I will seldom use the video feature and if I do, it's certainly good enough for my purposes. Somehow, I thought the camera could shoot in 4K, but instead it only shoots in 1080p. I think one has to spend an extra $300 to get one that shoots in 4K. Bummer, but again, not a big concern for me and the video quality (on my 4K 32" monitor) is still excellent. 4K would have been better but whaat the hell. I was already $200 over budget with the camera.<br/><br/>Software and Interface:<br/><br/>The camera interface, while not winning any prizes, is serviceable. I have not explored every little crevice, but it's a lot better than my old Rebel and looks better organized than the SL1 I was using until my SL3 arrived.<br/>I had to shoot with a Nikon for about a year (provided by my client) and that camera had a pretty bad interface, plus Nikon did not include remote shooting software with it. Or, I should say, they didn't include it for free, which I think is criminal.<br/>My older Rebel did and I was happy to see that this SL3 does too. Installation was a breeze as was connecting it to my desktop.<br/>Now I am curious to see how it will handle connecting to my devices. I have a Desktop, a Laptop, a Music/Video production laptop, 2 ipads and a iPhone. I am slightly concerned about using my laptop as a remote control and repository for the pictures. I need it to easily switch from one computer to the other without too much fussing. I will update if this proves to be cumbersome, at which point I will slave the camera to my laptop instead of my desktop and save directly to my cloud drive, that way all computers will receive the same picture (I shoot with my laptop, I do post-production on my desktop and sometimes I master video on the other laptop attached to my music studio. It can be confusing)<br/><br/>Other than the above, it all seems serviceable and I am really happy with this camera.<br/>It's a plastic body Rebel, so if you are a war correspondent, maybe it's not the camera for you. If you need 4K video, again, you want to spend a bit more for that.<br/>But if you need excellent pictures and the features I listed above, this camera will do the job.<br/>If you are thinking "Do I really need the tilting LCD?", only you can answer that question. If you are a tourist or need to be light product shooting, maybe not, but for me it was important enough to pick this camera over the T7, which has pretty much similar characteristics but no tilting LCD.<br/>I did a few shooting sessions with the SL1 and I missed the ability to tilt the LCD every single shot, and I am very experienced at shooting handheld, framing the photo in my mind. Someone with less experience (or not as steady hands) would have to take a lot of shots before ending up with a decent one.<br/><br/>Final thoughts: It's a good camera for photographers. Videographers may want to look at the next camera up for 4K (assuming I am correct mine doesn't do 4K)</span>

<span>A really great camera for beginners, excellent quality photos and the lenses are so interchangeable with canon bodies which have been used for years. That was the selling point for me, I only needed the body since I had lenses from 15 years ago that would work great. The flash was not intuitive to me, specifically how to turn it off since the only options are auto or forced on. Turns out, just don't lift it up and it won't fire. This battery lasts forever, and it's a perfect fit for my hand. Great overall quality, and I'm very happy with my purchase.</span>

<span>There isn't much to dislike about Canon's SL3 SLR camera.  I buy camera bodies often, keep them a year and then often upgrade (I travel for a living).<br/><br/>I have yet to find a really good POINT &amp; SHOOT camera to carry for my travels.  They always let me down (Canon included) in performance.<br/><br/>Now comes another SL series Canon camera (I thought the Sl1 and SL2 were dismal and cheap) called the SL3.  Still offered in the tacky 'White' version as well as the classic black body.<br/><br/>I'm not about to list all of the specs (you can read those on your own by visiting the Canon website) here but I will keep this basic and to the point.  I've purchased two of these (one on the day it was released and another from Amazon).<br/><br/>Let's go right to the processor (DIGIC 8)...  This is a rocket ship processor in speed and lighting.  Dark closets, no flash, no tripod, etc, etc, etc all still produced vivid photos when I tested the SL3 I had just purchased.  In fairness, I did use a SanDisk Extreme Pro 300MG card for speed but that card had nothing to do with lighting.  I also used a L-Series IS lens which was e real reason for the superior lighting conditions produced.<br/><br/>The camera body is made in Taiwan.  Mostly plastic and very lightweight.  The GRIP of the body is fabulous.  The so-called KIT lens (18-55mm) is sub-par in performance but it's an excellent lightweight inexpensive lens if weight is an issue.  The SL3 will accept both EF-S lenses and EF lenses.<br/><br/>Because I travel and carry way too much equipment, I wanted Canon to produce a fantastic Point &amp; Shoot.  They did not.  Along comes the SL3  (red flags already after the Sl1 and SL2).  Was I ever wrong...<br/><br/>I was so glad I tried the SL3.  Lightweight.  Even with the basic lens kit (F4 18-55mm lens) made mostly of plastic, it still did a great job of beating out any Point &amp; Shoot.  Plus at only 2 lbs for body and lens with battery.  It was a BMW in performance despite being inexpensive, made of all plastic and a bit flimsy at times for switches and controls.<br/><br/>This is no Canon 6D Mark II or 5D IV.  Not even close.  But keep the cost in mind.  Keep the weight in mind.  Mostly, keep that fabulous Digic 8 processor in mind.  So impressive.<br/><br/>A great choice.  Actually, a bit under-priced I think.<br/><br/>Canon hit a home run in the SL3.</span>

<span>I grew up learning photography on cameras that had knobs and lens rings to control the exposure. When digital cameras came out they just didn't feel right with their buttons and rotary wheels. There is something about twisting a knob to set the shutter speed that just feels right. I love being able to set up the exposure without even turning the camera on. You simply can't under estimate the value of being able to glance at the top of the camera to see where everything is set. This camera is a joy to use.<br/><br/>Update.<br/>The one must have accessory is a grip like the one from SmallRig. The FM2 (which the Z fc is modeled after) has nothing on the back of the camera so it is easy to grab by the body an pick up. If you try to do that with this camera you will be mashing buttons. With the grip you can pick it up without disturbing the buttons on the back.</span>

<span>I have to admit, I bought the Nikon Zfc maninly because of nostalgia of Nikon film camera. That said, the Zfc is very capable on its own. I always wanted a pocket camera, but none of the point and shots cut it. What attracted me the most about the Zfc, other than its cool look, are the small form and light weight, good image quality, fun to shoot. It can be easily slip into a pocket and bring to anywhere. Image quality is plenty good for most use, online viewing etc, but can't compete with my full frame Z7, maybe even a bit short of my 10 years old D600. The raw file is just not as clean as full frame cameras'. Noise is more obvious. Build quality is good but can be better. The thin metal (?) frame can be made more substantial, more like the classic FM2. Battery life is pretty impressive. I shot one charge over 700 shots, still have 30% left. But I did turned off automatic review. The cheap 16-50 mm kit lens is nice and small with very useful range. But I feel the quality is just not there. All things considered, I like the Zfc, glad I bought it, and I am having fun with it.</span>

<span>You’ve probably read a million reviews on this.  Only things I can add 1) when holding camera, you’ll need the small rig camera grip, which is great, but it’s a little uncomfortable on my ring finger of my right hand.  Just doesn’t sit right on the hard edge.  Small price to pay though.<br/>2) the other thing is, I wish I would’ve bought the kit with the 28mm SE lens and then the 50-250 zoom.<br/>I have all 3 lenses now and really don’t use the the kit 16-50?

<span>My first ZS100 camera arrived DOA.  It seemed to work until the first time I tried to zoom out.  Then, part way out the lens ground (literally) to a halt and I got the dreaded "System Error: Zoom" message on the screen.  I tried turning it off but the lens was jammed.  I applied a little pressure and tried turning it on and off a few times and finally got the lens to retract normally.  I powered it on and it seemed normal until I tried to zoom and then the same thing happened again.  I went online and tried the few things recommend by Panasonic.  No help. I did a chat with a Panasonic rep online and he said the camera needs to be returned.  I was NOT a happy camper.  I had been very excited to get this new camera and it was defective!  Worse, I found I was not alone in this, there were a significant number of others that had the same issue, though some did not have it occur right out of the box.  I called Amazon support and they were GREAT.  I had a replacement camera in my hands the next day!!!!<br/><br/>The replacement has worked fine for the past couple of months, but I still have the thought in the back of my head each time I turn it one, "is it going to fail this time".  That is NOT what you want to have in you head when using a fairly expensive camera.  Note that I did not deduct any points for this issue since it was rectified immediately and the replacement camera works fine.  But it is disappointing to read online about all the others that have this issue and yet Panasonic has not seemed to address the problem other than offering to repair it (which requires paying to send it to them and waiting several months for it to be fixed - and possibly being denied a warranty fix because they claim you must have damaged the camera).  This did not happen to me, but others reported this added abuse after their camera broke.<br/><br/>Anyway, back to the replacement camera.  I have been very pleased with almost all of the features and operation of the camera.  Yes, there are way too many items in the menu making for a high learning curve.  But I don't have to use all those features and settings.  If I just ignore those I do not understand or that do not interest me, I am able to have a lot of control over the features of the camera that I care about.  The negatives I found are 1) the camera does not focus well in low light.  I have had a number of blurry pictures that should have been clear.  I am talking about light like normal indoor room light not darkness.  2) The facial recognition (the camera can memorize up to 6 people's faces and will identify them on screen when it sees them) is inaccurate.  It usually knows it is seeing one of the people in the list but id's the person as someone else in that list.  3) There are some "gotchyas" - for example, the touted 5-axis stabilization does not work during 4K video recording.  Why not?  4) If you want to let the camera process the pictures into a JPG format (rather than using the much larger RAW format files that need post processing by you) the results are not always good.  Some JPG format photos look great, others have too much contrast or details have been lost in bright or dark areas (low dynamic range).  The RAW (unprocessed) photos do not usually have these shortcomings.  I have started to save BOTH the JPG and RAW format files for each picture (which the camera will do) and use the JPG picture where it looks good, or use the RAW picture if the JPG has issues that can be fixed by using the RAW format file.<br/><br/>Many reviewers have said the camera is slippery.  I do not find it slippery as much as "not tacky" to the touch.  But given the choice of using only the words "solid, firm feel" or "slippery" I would have to choose the latter.  You can use some rubberized tape or buy one of the add on grips by Flipbac ($9.95 on Amazon) to address the issue.<br/><br/>While the camera DOES fit in my shirt pocket (but would not be a good fit in a normal pants pocket) it is slightly too heavy and pulls down that side of the shirt.  So, yes I do keep it in a shirt pocket most of the time, but if you care about how your shirt looks, which I don't, you may decide to use a neck strap (which I think would actually look worse - but would be more convenient).<br/><br/>I have read and watched a LOT of reviews of this camera both before and after I purchased it.  The reviews are about 95% positive.  It feels good to read reviews by experts (or at least authorities) on cameras and hear them say nice things about the product I just spent a lot of money to purchase (though I did catch the camera on sale for under $500). Thinking about all the pros and cons of the camera that reviewers have mentioned AND that I have experienced, I am happy with my decision and would definitely recommend this camera to someone who wanted a compact, easy to carry and use camera with great features.  My biggest issue is that zoom failure problem which might reappear at the worst possible time.  But I am thinking positive and hoping that this camera is not going to have that issue.</span>

<span>This is overall the best camera you can still take to a live music event/concert since most venues still allow you to bring a small pocket camera, and the ZS100 doesn't have a professional body or detachable lens which are the two biggest restrictions venues have. Unless the show you're going to has a very strict no camera policy (you'll know its strict if they email you a camera policy) and you don't try to conceal the camera in a pocket while going through security, you will have absolutely no problems taking this to shows.<br/><br/>As far as its performance during the show, its hard to beat. 10x zoom is enough to get you a fairly clear shot of the band on stage, from almost any point in any venue. For theaters, ballrooms, and clubs, you'll never have an issue getting a decent closeup of your favorite member, even if you're at the back of the venue. For arenas, the zoom will still get you close enough to see the band in great detail, even from the nosebleeds. And as long as you aren't in the grass for an amphitheater, the zoom will serve you well enough.<br/><br/>Picture quality is incredibly sharp, the large sensor allows you to get a quick enough shutter speed to avoid any motion blur from the artist dancing around on stage, and for the most part, digital noise is kept to an absolute minimum. However, if you're in a smaller venue that is quite hazy/smokey, the detail the camera can capture is reduced greatly. Once the smoke clears you'll get amazing sharp shots again. It is best to use the manual features though, as auto mode will not correctly adjust settings to get the best picture. Using shutter priority mode, you can set a shutter speed of somewhere between 1/40-1/125 and an ISO of 1200 or 1600 and almost always get a very clear, well lit shot.<br/><br/>The one big thing that makes this camera better than the competition is its video quality, specifically the sound quality from the microphones. I go to 10+ shows a year and this camera always manages to get great sounding audio. The audio will actually come out a little muddy, but if you get an easy to use program like Movavi Video Editor, and use the music enhancement feature, you'll end up with crystal clear audio that sounds better than anything your phone or rival camera will capture. Video quality is very sharp and clear, has fast autofocus, and captures light fantastically. The only problem comes when the venue gets hazy/smokey and you lose a lot of the sharpness.<br/><br/>Another HUGE bonus is the battery life. The battery will last you an entire 2 hour performance, even if you are recording or taking pictures for most of those 2 hours. I used to always bring back up batteries with me but this camera has eliminated my need to do that. By the end of most shows I'm still on 2/3 bars of battery life left, which is incredible considering how much I use the camera during performances.<br/><br/>As far as general use, this camera takes very good pictures. However for the price, you're better off getting a mirrorless camera for picture quality, but keep in mind you can't bring mirrorless cameras into music venues.<br/><br/>The only real issue with this camera ends up being its size and zooming speed. This is technically a small pocket camera/compact camera, but it BARELY fits in your pants pocket, and can be quite uncomfortable to have in there. The zoom isn't very fast, and if you're taking video, the zoom is loud and will distort loud audio when zoom is in use.</span>

<span>I previously had Canon, Casio and Sony compact digital cameras until I switched to the Panasonic LUMIX travel zoom cameras which I liked for their image quality, ease of use and great zoom range. This is my third Panasonic travel zoom camera with this one replacing a ZS50.  The ZS50 was good but it had a small image sensor and I was looking for better image quality along with low light performance.  The ZS200 is slightly thicker and heavier than the ZS50 but it feels more solidly built.  With the introduction of the ZS200, this is the first compact camera which I thought combined a large sensor with a zoom range that would be large enough for travel photography, so I purchased it for an upcoming vacation.  The previous ZS100 had a more limited zoom range and produced unacceptable “softer” images based on reviews.  A co-worker of mine has a ZS100 and complains about the camera producing soft images with a lot a purple fringing occurring around foliage.  The lens and image processor are different between these two cameras.<br/><br/>I just came back from a 23 day trip to Greece visiting Athens, Santorini, Mykonos, Delos, Meteora, Delphi and used the ZS200. I used SanDisk Extreme Pro 128GB Class 3 95MB/sec SD cards and took 5,200 photos (24GB) with the ZS200 using 16:9 format for widescreen displays, 8MP jpg, high-quality setting since am not planning to make any large prints or do any post production modifications.  I set the camera to full intelligent auto+ mode for ease of use while traveling and found the camera easy to use in terms of start up, shut down, focusing, image stabilization and framing the view using the screen.  Regarding Image quality, I feel that this camera takes excellent images in terms of sharpness, color rendition and  low lighting when placed in full auto mode.  Compared to all the other digital cameras that I have had, the battery life of this camera is truly remarkable.  After a full day of taking over 300 photos, constantly zooming, cycling on and off the camera, the battery still had two bars left.  If you just take photos with no videos, then I don’t ever see a need for having a second backup battery if you charge at night like I did<br/><br/>I am not a fan of the touchscreen because it is too easy to mistakenly bring up the side menus and make unwanted adjustments to the camera.  The on-off switch could also use more resistance since I mistakenly turned it on in my camera bag several times. It would be nice to have some water and dust resistance incorporated but maybe Panny is saving these features for future versions.  I also installed a Peak Design Leash Camera Strap Black (L-BL-3) which works better than just a hand strap in being able to walk with the camera hands-free on my neck or over my shoulder and take images on the fly.  There are some major features like manual modes, RAW format and 4K video which I am not interested in and did not use.  I am a casual travel photographer and this camera on full intelligent auto+ mode works for me.  Having owned three Panasonic LUMINX cameras, I have not had any problems which required me to contact Panasonic for servicing so I cannot comment on their quality (or lack thereof) of customer care.  I may just have been lucky in getting perfectly functioning cameras but I am not complaining:)</span>

<span>The two uploaded photos are of the same section of landscape, one zoomed out (24mm) and the other fully zoomed in (360mm).<br/><br/>Review:<br/><br/>Got this to avoid carrying my dlsr and lenses on hikes, and to do time lapse of sunrises and sunsets.<br/><br/>Step 1: Throw away the (junk/out of date) user guide in the box right after you open it once to scan the qr code to download the excellent user manual.<br/><br/>Step2:  Install (under the same cover as the battery) a 128gb or less SD card<br/><br/>Step 3: Charge the battery (charging port under the same small cover as the hdmi port)<br/><br/>Step 4: Set the wheel to iA+ (fully automatic shutter speed/exposure f stop) and if desired set the drive mode to burst with burst speed set to slow (2 shots per second if/while you hold down the shuttter release).<br/><br/>Step 5: Turn it on, point and shoot.<br/><br/>What actually prompted me to make this purchase is that I went on a great hike with views where I took a good number of pictures with my (decent) Samsung A71 5G UW smartphone Camera, but afterward found that the pictures didn't have anywhere close to sufficient resolution to want to print - or even share, *especially the zoomed in ones* - which was painfully dissapointing.<br/><br/>In comparison, the ZS200 displays markedly superior picture quality - staggeringly better when zoomed.<br/><br/>(Among other things, a good lesson/reminder on the merits of optical vs. digital zoom).<br/><br/>So far (10 days/1050 pictures later) I am overall quite pleased with this camera. The size, weight, picture quality and particularly the zoomed picture quality make the purchase price more than worth it for me. I remove the top portion of the camera case (not included, see below) when I go hiking, throw the cover strap over my shoulder and I'm finding it fairly quick to grab, turn on and shoot without having to remove the shoulder strap. After some practice, I find I am also able to do that one handed which is a plus, as I often have both my trekking poles in my other hand.<br/><br/>All that is to say I think I'll have a fair chance to get some opportunistic/fleeting shots of wildlife using this setup if and when they present themselves.<br/><br/>The camera does have a multitude of features and settings that I really haven't played with in the week or so since I got it, but it is quite a sophisticated piece of compact engineering.<br/>It's fairly deep into "real camera" territory for those who want to manage their own depth of field/shutter speed etc, so don't mistake it for the severely limited point and shoots of yesteryear.<br/><br/>One note about time lapse that I couldn't find in the user manual:<br/><br/>If you use a shot interval &gt; 30 seconds for time lapse photography, the camera will retract the lens barrel every shot, darken the display, then extend the lens barrel and turn on the display for the next shot.<br/>I had to try different shot intervals to determine where the barrel stays put for the duration (&lt;= 30 seconds) but when I originally set it to 150 shots at 1 minute intervals I observed the barrel extending and retracting each shot (150 times per time lapse series).<br/>I for one don't want to put that much wear and tear on the lens barrel stepper motor and parts, so I'll only use 30 seconds or less for a time lapse interval, but it seemed like something Panasonic should have spelled out in their manual (searched and couldn't find anything about that operation).<br/>Of note is I did have the lens set partially zoomed (~110mm) when I observed this, but I really don't believe that was a factor.<br/><br/>Also bought and reccommend<br/><br/>Mini Tripod for Camera,Zomei Travel Table Tripod with 3-Way Pan/Tilt Head 1/4 inches Quick Release Plate and Bag for DSLR Camera<br/>(THIS TRIPOD IS ONLY 20.5" FULLY EXTENDED)<br/><br/>SanDisk 128GB Extreme PRO SDXC UHS-I Card - C10, U3, V30, 4K UHD, SD Card<br/><br/>MegaGear Ever Ready Genuine Leather Camera Case Compatible with Panasonic Lumix DMC-ZS100, DC-ZS200<br/>(IF YOU LIKE LEATHER, RETRO STYLE COVERS)<br/><br/>For me, the only downside (more aptly the cheap side) I will mention that the battery cover latch and the charging/hdmi port cover feel a bit flimsy to me, but I couldn't possibly justify dropping my review score by a star due to to those two largely aesthetic details.</span>
