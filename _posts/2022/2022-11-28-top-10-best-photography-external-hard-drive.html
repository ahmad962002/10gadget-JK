<span>I use these external units to back-up and safeguard import work/personal documents.  I recently had a 250mb external HD fail due to a faulty connection port.  I was able to unscrew the case and remove the HD for insertion into another unit and was able to recover the stored documents.  My fear with this design is that if something other than the HD should fail, I might not be able to recover the drive's content.  Other than that, it's a great little HD.</span>

<span>I was a little hesitant to order due to mixed reviews concerning Time Machine backup. I ordered this as a same day delivery as I needed it quickly and it arrived promptly. It works with a Mac computer for backups, but it does requires very little reformatting. I got it to work with no issues at all. I’ll try to explain below in hopes to make it easier for anyone else having this issue.<br/><br/>When I first connected this hard drive, my MacBook recognized it, but once it tried selecting it as my Time Machine drive, it didn’t work right out the box, and it ended up not showing up anymore. So I’ll try to explain how I remedied this.<br/><br/>First you will want to open up ‘Disc Utility’ from the ‘Applications’ folder. From there, you will want to select ‘View &gt; Show all devices’ from the top bar so that you see all the drives. Select your Seagate drive and hit ‘Erase’ (if you are setting this up from a new drive this shouldn’t be an issue since you won’t have any files on it anyway and this is the only way to format it). When filling out the info (this is very important) you will want to name your drive correctly with the following information:<br/><br/>Name:<br/>ExternalHHD (or whatever you choose)<br/><br/>Format:<br/>MacOS Extended Journaled (USE THIS IF YOU PLAN TO USE THIS ONLY BETWEEN MAC COMPUTERS).<br/>*OR*<br/>ExFAT (USE THIS IF YOU PLAN TO USE THIS BETWEEN BOTH MAC AND PC COMPUTERS)<br/><br/>Scheme: GUID Partition Map<br/><br/>Hit erase and you should be good to go! If you have any issues after formatting it as ExFAT, follow the same steps by formatting it as a MacOS Extended journal, then go back and reformat again as ExFAT afterwards. No idea why this even works but it does (as it happened to me).<br/><br/>Now if you want to use this drive as 2 drives you can. I set up my 5TB and split it so that 2TB is dedicated to Time Machine Backups, and the other 3TB is dedicated to my normal documents and files. You would need to partition this using disc utility as well but I recommend a quick YouTube search to better explain that part.</span>

<span>What I'm about to tell you will potentially save you from future catastrophic failures including loss of data. Nothing beats having multiple good backup copies.; however, the following information will instruct you on how to test your new drive to make sure it's free from defects.<br/><br/>Imagine, you have a spinning disk rotating thousands of times per minute separated by its recording/reading head by less thickness of a human hair. Just one wrong thing and .. "click..click..click".<br/><br/>You don't want that.<br/><br/>Generally speaking a bad hard drive will make itself known sooner vs later when it's tested fully. Not always. What YOU can do is put the hard drive through its paces to really give it a good solid work out and make sure every space designated by the drive as available/writeable space, is in fact GOOD. Its magnetic/electrical properties strong.<br/><br/>This test is a LONG test. What it does is write all 0s, 1s, 0-1s. 1-0s (binary) to the disk. It does this in 4 passes (i.e. writes the disk fully) 4 times. After each write it will read what was just written beginning to end to ensure all bits were written exactly right.<br/><br/>If they wern't, the drive's detection mechanism for errors (SMART) will notice (i.e. a bit was not written to a sector correctly) and flag the SMART COUNTER. For example, uncorrectable or reallocated sector count would show a non-0 value.<br/><br/>During operation, if the drive encounters a fault with a sector it will swap that sector with another known good sector the drive has in reserve and will log it via SMART.<br/><br/>A PERFECTLY WORKING HARD DRIVE WILL SHOW '0' for 'Reallocated Sector Count','Reported Uncorrectable Errors','Current Pending Sector Count','Uncorrectable Sector Count'.IF ANY OF THESE VALUES SHOWS ANYTHING OTHER THAN A 0 (zero), THEN YOU HAVE A FAILING HDD AND SHOULD REPLACE IT ASAP. DO NOT TRUST YOUR DATA ON IT.<br/><br/>This command will erase everything on the disk if there is data already on there when you run this test. For a 5TB it took me over 4 days. But I am confident the data will be safe because it worked out the drive  hard and pictures above show good numbers.<br/><br/>Boot up your computer using a linux distribution boot usb/cd. Debian Ubuntu, any one will do--it doesn't matter.<br/><br/>In a terminal type: sudo fdisk -l<br/>*Identiy which /dev is your HDD you wish to test. Also note if it says 512 or 4096 where it says "Sector size (logical/physical)". For example, if it's /dev/sde and says 4096 Sector Size (such as this 5tb drive) then type the following command:<br/><br/>sudo badblocks -wsv -b 4096 -c 131072 /dev/sde<br/><br/>This will 0,1,01,10 write and read/verify the drive back-to-back in 4 passes. On my slow computer via USB 3, this took around  4.5 days to complete.<br/><br/>The ' -b '  option is the Block Size. This should match the drive. 512 or 4096. The '-c' option tells badblocks how many blocks to test at time. Changing this number will alter the speed and will either make the process go along faster or slower (dependant on Drive Interface, Ram/Cpu speed, etc.). Instead of '-c 131072' ,try '-c 65536 if it seems the test is taking too long to increment the %'s.<br/><br/>In fact try it with '-c 65536' option. Let it run or 30 sec then CTRL-C to cancel it. Then run the command again but with '-c 131072' instead. Run it for 30 sec then CTRL-C to cancel. Compare the 2 and whichever command that had the  higher % when you CTRL-C'd would be the number you would choose since that one ran a little bit faster.  Google or man page 'badblocks' for more information.<br/><br/>Whenever you buy a new hard drive get into the mindset/habit that you will NOT use them for at least a week (or 2) because you have to test them out first. Trust me on this and it's totally worth it. I'd like to think I avoid catastrophic failures because I did this test and it would have presented itself (or at least more likelihood) then vs months/years down the road. That's not a given--any drive can fail anytime or any reason but this is just an additional layer. Like a "shakedown cruise' if you will.<br/><br/>Regarding this drive: Seagate Portable 5TB External Hard Drive HDD – USB 3.0, I can say that I am pleased it tested clean and I look forward to using this drive.And I'm confident it will keep my data intact.<br/><br/>You are welcome!</span>

<span>I'm writing this because of all the reviews I see complaining about the drive not showing up on their computer initially, saying "it doesn't work right out of the box!" I often wonder if some of these people never even read the documentation before giving up. The included documentation for the drives is horrible, with only a Quick Start page that shows how to plug it in, but there is great info on Seagate's site that helps if you go look at it. There's also something else I found out that might be helpful, and I'll address that here. Once I've had it in use for a while I'll update this review for a more in-depth account of how well it works. I'll list my comments by issue:<br/><br/>1) Drive not getting recognized.<br/>After seeing so many "it doesn't show up" comments, I was concerned when mine didn't show up on my iMac either. I followed the instructions on plugging it in (in sequence, which may or may not make a difference, but you gotta do it correctly just in case), and the first thing you have to do is decide which US Standard plug to slide onto the universal plug adapter; there are two that are almost identical, two-prong plugs; one has holes in the prongs and the other doesn't. Docs say nothing about which to use, so I went with the one with holes.<br/><br/>The unit powered up and sounded like it was initializing, but it wouldn't get recognized by my Late 2017 iMac. Unplugging and restarting did nothing. I went to the online documentation and did the recommended check to see if Show Hard Drives was checked in Finder/Preferences/Show-Hard Drives. It was (which I already knew because my others show there, but just in case I needed to recycle the command...). That did no good. After a bit of thought, I decided I'd try the other plug, and that did the trick. USE THE PLUG WITH NO HOLES IN IT if using in the US!<br/><br/>Once that was solved, it showed up and all looked good.<br/><br/>2) Using with Time Machine on Mac.<br/>The info in the product description says the drive is ready to use with Time Machine, preformatted. The problem is, if you have Catalina or later, there is a new formatting called APFS that replaces xFat, and you will have to reformat to use with Time Machine. This is a simple process using Disc Utility, and it reformats quickly.<br/><br/>Once I had that issue solved, I got Carbon Copy Cloner (trial version) and set up the tasks of copying my main hard drive (348.3 GB) and my 8 TB external drive to the new Seagate drive and let it go. The main drive was backed up in just over 47 minutes. Yeah, it's a tad noisy, but nothing that can't go on while working on the computer by any means unless you're maybe recording a YouTube video at the computer or something.<br/><br/>The external drive, which had 6.58 TB of stuff on it took a little longer... 12 1/2 hours to be exact. Slow? I don't know, it's the first time I've copied a hard drive with that much stuff on it, but I set the task and left it alone and it was done in the morning. The image included here shows Carbon Copy's review page for the performed tasks.<br/>CAVIAT: you may need to use a program that allows the computer to work without shutting down after a period of inactivity. I use an app called "Amphetemine", which forces the computer to stay on in various circumstances that you can set. I set mine to remain on "as long as specified app is working" and chose Carbon Copy Cloner. Not sure you have to do this, but Amphetamine is a great app and I didn't want to take the chance of having to start over, so I used it, and it worked great.<br/><br/>The noise some complain about could be other drives (I have the 12 TB version for desktop) or it may be a personal preference, but a drive in a plastic case like this with lots of air holes in it will make some noise, however I didn't find this "noisy" at all IMHO.<br/><br/>So far, I'm impressed with Carbon Copy as well, but like the drive, I'm in my infancy with using it, so time will tell. I also have a 1 TB external I use for Time Machine, so instead of using this one for that, I will most likely also set up the drive to copy that drive so I have a backup of my Time Machine just in case. You can set Carbon Copy to copy whenever it detects a change in a drive, so once the initial copying is done, the lengthy copies are done, and it's only copying when things change.<br/><br/>If you have issues with one of these drives not being recognized by your computer straight out of the box, FIRST make sure you have the correct US plug installed. THEN, make sure to reformat to APFS if you're running Catalina or later if you plan to use it for your Time Machine backups. At that point, so far in my experience, it's a great drive. I'm giving four stars only because of having to hunt down good documentation for the actually necessity for reformatting for the OSs, and for having NO information about the right plug to use. NO idea why the one with holes won't work, but it would be nice if they gave a heads-up on that.<br/><br/>Once it's been working a while, I'll readdress this review.</span>

<span>I loved this thing since I got it at the tail end of 2019. I save all my important docs, pictures, emulators, etc on this drive. I do not use it for automated backup and I use a Miscrosoft Surface Book 2. My issue with this hard drive is sometimes it takes a while for it to load after putting in my password. The high probability of constantly troubleshooting and losing all of my precious data freaks me out. I can deal with unplugging and re-plugging once or twice to get it to work. Tonight I tried to get it to load for 3 hours, doing combinations of laptop restarts, unplugging and re-plugging, switching power cords, trying to use Toolkit to deactivate the password feature (that's where it always seems to freeze and stop responding). It seems like it doesn't stay powered on long enough through the loading process and just stops responding. I have not tried calling customer support yet as it's almost 23:00 EST as of this writing, but I may try tomorrow. If it is something that is easily fixed, I would love to give it 5 stars.<br/><br/>UPDATE 2/22/21: I was finally able to disable password encryption and no issues! 4 stars only because I'm not sure if it will act up again when I re-enable it.</span>

<span>As noted in other reviews it worked right out of the pkg on my MacBook Pro w/o any formatting. Used solely to store my tens of thousands photos.

<span>First I love the compact size and then the price for 2T is very good. It wasn't hard to set up with my MacBookPro. Once I went through the downloaded installer and was able to go to the Time Machine in my system preferences and check this as my preferred backup device. The first backup is a little over one hour but I have a lot to download so the time to do this is fine with me. I also liked the fact that it came with a USB-C adaptor so I didn't have to go to an Apple dongle. I have used G Drives in the past but the prices are extremely high now if all you are doing is backing up to your personal computer. I am not a tech savvy person but I didn't need any tech support to get this running.</span>

Hard Drive doesn’t stall and can work on multiple transfers at once! I do not recommend using a USB C cable that is not USB C 3.0. I used a phone adapter and transfer speeds were up to 40 mbps.

<div class="slideshow-container">
<blockquote><em><div class="a-row a-spacing-small review-data"><span class="a-size-base review-text review-text-content" data-hook="review-body">
<span>I purchased two drives, a 2TB in Black and a 2TB in Red. They will each take the place of two desktop bound external 2TB drives that have been dutifully serving as my Media and Time Machine drives that,  until bad sector errors have reached critical mass, have performed quite well for a few years. It's fortunate that they should choose to die now, as I'm also moving overseas and would have hated for them to go a month or two from now while I'm over there. Portable was definitely the way to go for me. I don't need 7200 or 10800rpm drives and I don't want to be adapting bulky wall warts overseas, either.<br/><br/>Now, there's a bunch of options out there from Toshiba, Western Digital, Seagate and many other lesser-known brands for external, portable drives in the 2TB range. I've been mainly a Seagate customer for the past 5 years or so because they've proven to me that their products have a long life and perform well. This was for desktop models only, however, and design never played a part because they are all, pretty much, big and clunky boxes that sit and do nothing. A portable drive is a different story, and I think Seagate has outdone itself with this drive.<br/><br/>Design. Before I bought the two Seagate models, I had bought a WD My Passport 2TB drive at Staples. It was alright, but it was very thick. Nearly twice the thickness of my MacBook Air at the hinge end. The chassis was metal surrounded in plastic and it looked alright. It certainly wasn't going to vie with the MacBook Air for looks and I think it suffered because it tries. The performance was fine, just what I'd expect from a portable USB 3.0 drive. The real problem with the design, though, was not the thickness but the shape. There was virtually no flat surface on the drive at all. Every edge was tapered and the flat surfaces had some convexing going on. Mine would rock side to side on a desk and wouldn't stay in position in my lap. I looked on Amazon for alternatives and found this. I'm happy to report that, with the sides leading to the bottom are tapered, the bottom of these drives are flat and are made of a nicely textured plastic that feels good and grips well on a desk or a leg. The top is even better, being a piece of aluminium that is completely flat and very good looking. Despite the colour scheme not being derived from Apple, the slimness and choice of materials certainly make this feel as though it belongs in a bag with my MacBook or on my desk next to my Magic Trackpad. It's the best looking external drive I've seen. The light on it, however, feels distinctly Apple. Overall, the design is excellent and, without going to the lengths of moulding a piece of metal over a bare drive (see the Seagate Seven), this is probably as slim as you can expect these drives to get. It's nice to see products that design around the user and still manage to keep it looking good rather than just make it pretty.<br/><br/>Performance and Heat. As said, these replace my other drives that serve other purposes and that are just about full. So, first order of business was to copy over the old Media and backups to the new drives. First, I formatted them for Mac. For those who don't know, you can buy just about any drive and use it for Mac, even if it says Windows or PC. This can save you a lot of money. Just open Disk Utility, click the drive, select Format and click Mac OS Extended (Journaled) or whatever filesystem you'd like to use. After that, I just dragged and dropped. From a USB 3.0 drive to another USB 3.0 drive with my Retina MBP, two terabytes copied in a little over five hours. This puts the total transfer speed around 100MB/s. Pretty damn fast. While the files were transferring, I made sure to keep an eye on the heat coming from the Seagate Slims (well, I kept the back of my hand on it) and was pleased to report that neither the metal top nor the plastic bottom got any hotter than my MacBook Air runs on my lap. That is to say, they didn't get hot at all, merely warm, and I don't think there's a hazard here.<br/><br/>Packaging. Who cares? Its a cardboard box around a plastic shell. The tape holding the box shut was annoying like the tape on new DVDs and Blurays that never comes off in one pull, no matter how much you use your nail to free it. Included is the drive, a fact sheet and a USB cable. Who needs more?<br/><br/>This is a great buy. At (if I remember what should be the numerator and what the denominator) $0.05/GB this isn't the best you can do for 2TB, but it's really close. I'm happy with the performance, the design is stellar and user-centric and I suspect the lifetime of this product will be far longer than the time it will take me to fill these drives and need bigger ones.</span>

<span>My "Seagate 2TB Slim Red", as I renamed it, came a day early well packaged &amp; pretty in red. Its 18" USB 3.0 cable fits tightly on both ends. This Dell Inspiron i5 3542, Win 8.1, immediately put a "Safely Remove..." icon on the Taskbar &amp; chirped. I DO use that icon when I want to disconnect it, although I see, in Device Manager,  Windows set it for "quick removal". And I leave it set that way. (Aready I've rebooted &amp; let the laptop sleep forgetting to use that icon with no detectable ill effects - but no writing was going on that I know of.)<br/><br/>Quick Removal: Disables write caching, but supposedly no need to use icon.<br/>Better Performance: Enables write caching, but must use the icon.<br/>(Dell Diagnostics says... Cache Size: &gt;= 32.0 MB.)<br/><br/>I ran Dell's performance tests: smart status, 2 smart thresholds tests, targeted read, random seek, funnel seek, 2 linear read tests - &amp; it passed each. The optional SMART Extended Self Test ran for 6+ hours, &amp; it passed. I'm extremely pleased the drive got only midling warm (it has no vent holes) &amp; never clinked or clanked the whole time. I could only hear it spinning by getting close. And I lifted &amp; tilted &amp; held it an hour+ during the tests, but never turned it upside down. (Now/then I felt a tiny kick in there; hence, the cesarians some here have performed on theirs. But I'll let mine come to term on its own!) Left plugged in for 10+ hours today - but little/no activity - it isn't even midling warm, though the 2.5" disk is spinning.<br/><br/>Pursuant to my main reason for getting the drive, I did a MS System Image Backup. It offered to backup the EFI System partition, C:, &amp; WINRETOOLS to "Seagate 2TB Slim Red" &amp; took just a tad over 7 minutes to do it. I see the WindowsImageBackup folder that was created is 28.5 GB huge &amp; the drive's used space increased accordingly. I did reboot to System Image Recovery &amp; was pleased to see the 2TB Slim listed as a recovery drive with the image shown by date for selection.<br/><br/>So, I must say I'm very pleased through four days of ownership. Definitely, I will update this review should anything go wrong. But I fully expect I'm invincible now...<br/><br/>(1) Dell recovery image partition (to factory install)<br/>(2) MS Recovery USB Flash drive<br/>  (Control Panel\All Control Panel Items\Recovery - Create a recovery drive)<br/>  This is necessary to boot without engaging partitions you intend to overwrite<br/>  with the Current System Image during a restore. This also has a copy of my<br/>  Dell factory image for refresh/reset purposes.<br/>(3) Current System Image on my Seagate 2TB Slim Red<br/>  (Control Panel\System and Security\File History - System Image Backup)<br/><br/>So, I'm all signed up to get the Win 10 upgrade! -<br/><br/>UPDATE 8/8/15: All continues to work well with my Seagate 2TB Slim RED. In addition to two for Win 8.1, it now holds two full system backups for Win 10. Back in July, I gave it a brother: Seagate 2TB Slim Blue. It too worked well out of the box, w/o installing the Seagate software. I put a clone of Win 8.1 onto it, before taking the upgrade to Win 10. Before that, I did run...<br/><br/>PS C:\Windows\system32&gt; chkdsk E: /R<br/>The type of the file system is NTFS.<br/>Volume label is Seagate 2TB Slim Blue.<br/><br/>Stage 1: Examining basic file system structure ...<br/>  256 file records processed.<br/>File verification completed.<br/>  0 large file records processed.<br/>  0 bad file records processed.<br/><br/>Stage 2: Examining file name linkage ...<br/>  282 index entries processed.<br/>Index verification completed.<br/>  0 unindexed files scanned.<br/>  0 unindexed files recovered.<br/><br/>Stage 3: Examining security descriptors ...<br/>Security descriptor verification completed.<br/>  13 data files processed.<br/><br/>Stage 4: Looking for bad clusters in user file data ...<br/>  240 files processed.<br/>File data verification completed.<br/><br/>Stage 5: Looking for bad, free clusters ...<br/>  488318496 free clusters processed.<br/>Free space verification is complete.<br/><br/>Windows has scanned the file system and found no problems.<br/>No further action is required.<br/><br/>1953513559 KB total disk space.<br/>  113728 KB in 7 files.<br/>  20 KB in 15 indexes.<br/>  0 KB in bad sectors.<br/>  125823 KB in use by the system.<br/>  65536 KB occupied by the log file.<br/>1953273988 KB available on disk.<br/><br/>  4096 bytes in each allocation unit.<br/> 488378389 total allocation units on disk.<br/> 488318497 allocation units available on disk.<br/>PS C:\Windows\system32&gt; exit<br/><br/>So, I remain overjoyed with Seagate.</span>

<span>I purchased four of these (5TB) in 2019—two for auto backups, two as external drives. They all sit undisturbed on a desk and are not carried around. In 2022 the external drives seem to be functioning as required. One backup drive failed at about 18 months, the other failed about a month ago. Neither was even near capacity.<br/><br/>Seagate was accommodating about the first failure even though for reasons I can't recall now the drive wasn't eligible for free data retrieval, but they retrieved data and replaced the drive at no cost to me. (It was during the pandemic, maybe they felt the need to be kind.) I haven't even tried to do anything about the second failure. Like a lot of people, I just want something that works without me having to think too much about it or investigate or troubleshoot. So I'll be looking at other brands when I replace that second failed Seagate backup drive.<br/><br/>Three stars because 2 of the 4 original drives continue to work, the replacement backup drive is good so far, and good customer service.</span>

<span>I'm currently doing a full format of this hard drive. I have the 5TB version. I've always been a fan of Seagate's portable hard drive, as I've been using it mostly for my Xboxes (I have 3 xbox for different rooms, each with a 2TB Seagate drive). I decided to build my first ever PC in January 2020, and used this hard drive as my storage along with my m.2 ssd for my boot drive, and 1TB SATA SSD for Steam and Blizzard games. Everything was going great with this hard drive. I even used it to install most of my Xbox Game Pass games for Windows 10 as well as my content creation from photoshop to 4K videos. However, on October 2020, things got funky out of nowhere for some odd reason. Literally, I just finished filming and I was transferring a few 4K video files via my micro SD card to this drive. I've never had issues in the past couple months, but the read and write speed was out of wack for some reason. I tried blaming my PC built since I overlocked the RAM via XMP-profile, and my hunch was that the voltage is possibly messing it up, so I resetted everything to default, but I came to find that it wasn't the cause since everything was going well even with XMP on or off except when transferring or moving files to and from this hard drive. Luckily, I have a backup 1TB SSD drive that I transferred all my majorly important files to (4K vids and photos), it was a pain staking 6 hours wait because of the continuous fluctution in transfer speed, dropping from 0kb/s to only getting up to 90mb/s. From there, I wiped out everything and am currently doing a full format in hopes that it will fix the issue. All in all, I think this is great for consoles, but not for PC or Mac.</span>

I called tech support and they are terrific.  I had to call several times for different issues on each machine and they were extremely helpful.  First, they call you back within a few minutes.  They are patient, professional, polite, and extremely knowledgeable about their drive and about the Mac operating system.  So, they walked me through very specific steps that I could easily follow and for each issue, they were able to find a solution such that the drive now works on both machines and automatically backs up the system as soon as the drive is plugged in.  The cost of the drive is very reasonable for the amount of storage it provides.  Although I had to call tech support several times, I'm glad I did and glad to have this external storage for backup.</span>

<span>Best thing since WD-40 and cordless drills. Very easy to set up and FAST! Backed up 2.5 TB in about 2 hrs on 4 different computers One Win 7 laptop, Three Win 10 desktops. Free software also is a plus, gotta fool with it a little. But the external drive itself is flawless. Manually made folders for different computers and logged backups into each one. I use EASEUS ToDo backup, and had each backup verified as to accuracy. NO ERRORS!! So much better than juggling USB jumpdrives, the larger ones, 512gb and up are unreliable most of the time. This Seagate you can pickup, plug it in, and copy whatever you want. I'd buy again...</span>

<span>I purchased this drive to expand the storage space on my gen. 1 PS4.  Many of the reviews reported sketchy results when trying to pair with a PS4 so I was hesitant but decided to chance it.<br/><br/>I am glad I did.  Out of the box, I plugged it into one of the two USB ports on the front of the machine and it was immediately recognized as a USB device.  The system gave me a prompt to do something with the device which gave me a shortcut to the device settings.  It allowed me to format the drive and I about 2 minutes, it was up and running.<br/><br/>The migration of nearly 500GB of game data took a little more than an hour but that is not the fault of the Seagate drive.<br/><br/>Games seem a bit smoother but that could be just from having a nearly empty native drive.  I was hoping that internet heavy games like Fortnite would not heat up the console as much, but no luck there.  The twitchiness is gone though.<br/><br/>All in all I am very happy with this Seagate drive on my PS4.  I wish I had sprung for it a long time ago and I think I might have been better off getting the 8TB drive but hopefully by the time that becomes an issue we will be looking at the PS5.</span>

<span>I keep two of these at both my home and my cottage (where I have been working during the pandemic). I use them with my MacBook Pro.

Of course, everything is also backed up to my 10 TB iCould storage and Microsoft OneDrive. So far, all four of these drives are rock solid.

<span>amazing capacity and good date transfer rates over USB high speed ports. No firewire thunder or ethernet but I didnt need those for what I am doing. Runs warm during extended data transfer and a bit of hum and seek noise when used on desktop but not objectionable.<br/>Update 8 2016. I have been using this drive for a year with the seagate app to do continuous backups as well as offline storage of archival files. A useful feature is that I have virtually every file from every computer I have ever owned on it so I can go back 20 plus years if needed. It does run warm but at least mine does not get very hot, no warmer than my Dell 7440 laptop even after the Seagate was doing non stop file searches for text strings 24x7 for days on end. I'm about ready to buy a second one and copy this one for offsite storage. I considered a lot of options before going with a second Backup plus- NAS boxes which could have offered RAID but didn't have direct USB access and the apparent addiction of WD to AES drive encryption. I would like Thunderbolt for my new laptop but Im not going to pay a 300 dollar premium for that. I would love a faster interface but the tradeoffs don't seem worthwhile yet. I loved the comment one reviewer had about sharp corners. So true- these are sharp enough to draw blood and are a true work of plastic molding art that is utterly inappropriate for the use. BTW I paid full price for the first one and am paying full price for the second one so no incentive to sugarcoat the review. Seagate is not my favorite drive vendor- Hitachi is by a long shot but they don't make a drive with the capacity I want.<br/>Update 2: I have been copying files from one 8tb drive to another and have the following to share that might be useful:<br/>1. its going to take a long time. Transfer rates with USB 3.0 on a winders 10 machine averages about 25 MB/s reported speed and it will take an estimated 4 days to copy the drive. 2. Temperature: I tried some temperature experiments since this is a topic of interest on these. I admit putting this in a poorly ventilated plastic box is not my idea of a good thermal design. After 24 hours of continuous data transfer as per above, the surface temp as measured by non contact infrared thermometer is 40-42 C (about 102 F). in still air at 72 F ambient. For the heck of it (yes I know whats going to happen, I have a tendancy to try things to test out theories) I stacked one drive on the other. I know, eye rolls but people put books and papers and stuff on running drives and as predicted everything gets hotter. Top drive went up to 44 C and the bottom drive was unhappy at 60 C but didnt throw any errors or warnings. I put them side by side and put a 4 inch  AC powered fan ( 10 bucks at local hardware store on a whim) on them and temperature dropped to 27 C or pretty close to ambient. It will still be hot inside of course as plastic is a good thermal insulator so I like the idea somebody had of unboxing the drive and putting some rubber feeties on it.3, Noise. Really cant hear it a 3 feet but up close you can barely hear the busy seek of tiny robot arms looking for a good place to read and write. Now call me old fashioned but I like that noise as I started out with big cluncky VAX and Winchester drives that sounded like a line printer. You can tell if a drive is going bad as it will make special help-I-cant-find-my-track-noise and need immediate treatment (refrigeration + copy then shred). If I could find a decent NAS box at a good price I would do this instead but as it is, manual RAID in action..</span>

<span> on July 2, 2014.  I have been using them now for just over one month. They are attached to two USB 3.0 ports on my Lenovo ThinkPad W510, running Windows 7 Ultimate 64-bit.  My internal C: drive is a 128GB SSD, and I use it only for storing programs and miscellaneous data (e.g., Microsoft Outlook files, etc.).  One of the Seagate drives contains all of my user data files, and it is powered on and operating any time my computer is running.  The second external disk drive is used to back up all the data on the first drive, plus data contained on a 2TB Western Digital Elements HDD.  The Western Digital drive is used primarily to store recorded TV programming.  I connect the "backup" Seagate drive only when I want to copy files from the "primary" drive or from the WD disk drive.<br/><br/>Since I anticipated the supplied USB cables would be rather short, I ordered two six-feet-long USB cables from Cable Matters.  That has permitted me to place the Seagate disk drives in more desirable locations, further from my computer.  Those cables work perfectly with the Seagate drives.<br/><br/>The data transfer speed between the Seagate drives, using USB 3.0, is very good; although, I have not performed any objective measurements to support my observations.<br/><br/>I have used the Western Digital Elements 2TB HDD as my primary data storage device for over four years, and I have experienced no unrecoverable data errors with it during that time.  However, I had a Western Digital My Book Essential (3TB) disk drive [WDBACW0030HBKNESN] that I was using for my "backup" drive, and it failed six months after the warranty expired.  That is why I decided to replace it with one of these Seagate drives, hoping that the Seagate would prove more reliable.<br/><br/>Since the Western Digital Elements and the Seagate Backup Plus have a similar form factor, I was interested in how hot the enclosure of the Seagate drives would be during normal operation.  I have found that the cover of the Seagate drive feels somewhat cooler than the cover of the Western Digital Elements drive when both are operating under similar conditions.  Since the WD Elements drive has proven reliable for over four years, hopefully heat will not be an issue with the life expectancy of the Seagate drives.<br/><br/>Why did I not give the Seagate Backup Plus drive a 5-star rating?  The backup software is worthless if you plan to back up any external disk drives. The Seagate Dashboard (as well as Seagate Manager) works only to back up internal C: drives.  After opening three different "cases" with Seagate and spending over one hour on the phone with a support specialist, they finally concluded that their software will not allow backing up an external drive to the Seagate Backup Plus.  I wish this information had been more clearly explained in the description of the device.  Oh well, the drives function well, and hopefully they will prove more reliable than my Western Digital My Book Essential (3TB).<br/><br/>If a person wants to back up only data from their C: drive, the software (Seagate Dashboard) seems to work well.  I was spoiled with the backup software (Smartware) provided by Western Digital because it worked very well to back up data from other external drives, as well as from the C: drive, to the WD My Book Essential.  It appears that the WD Smartware software will also work with Seagate drives, but it must be purchased from Western Digital for that application.<br/><br/>So . . . . for now, at least, I will manually back up my data files to the Seagate Backup Plus external hard drive.  I will wait to see how reliable the devices prove to be over the long run.  I would conditionally recommend the drive, but beware of the backup software if that is a purchase consideration.</span>

<span>Seagate 5 TB<br/><br/>- it seems to be functioning fine so far on my old iMac 5 which always runs out of space.<br/><br/>- I switched from an older 4 year old WD My Book which functioned perfectly but at 500 GB had simply become inadequate to store my stuff. I've never owned a Seagate product and I am keeping my fingers crossed. There is a $9.99 'recovery fee' option as you check out on Amazon which did not sit too well with me as it seems that the previous/current products have a 'problem' with numerous recovery requests, hence the need to charge the $10 for recovery. I could be wrong. Some reviewers have claimed that Seagate charges up to  $500 as recovery fees. I pray that that shall not happen to me (or you) and I might get another storage device as a secondary backup if the machine starts acting up. Maybe I should have paid the $10.<br/><br/>- the discounted price of the Seagate 5TB and the fact that I could get an extra 1TB by adding a bit of money on top of what I would have paid for a 4TB WD My Book swayed my decision.<br/><br/>- I plugged it in and downloaded the Seagate 'dashboard'.  I followed the instructions by other Mac owner reviewers to go to disk utility and partition the disk in order to format it for use by the iMac. Click on the Seagate 5TB drive and then at the top right hand side, click on 'partition and then choose 1 partition as your option.<br/>It seems that, for you to use the Seagate as the Time Machine, you have to choose the Mac OS journaled option while partitioning the drive.<br/><br/>-The Seagate dashboard then gives you the option of using it with a Mac or PC or with a Mac alone. It 'warns' you that some capabilities shall be lost when you select the Mac only option. It also recommends one to download Seagate software if selecting the Mac and PC option.<br/>- I selected the Mac only option as I wanted the Seagate drive to function as my Time Machine. Setup was a breeze and I clicked on the Time Machine option after setup to initiate the initial backup. The initial backup took a while (the bar said 6 hours but it was more like 1 and a half) but all subsequent backups have been fast.<br/>- the data is easily recoverable from the time machine which easily scrolls to whatever date and time the data you want to access was saved and you may access it the same way it was saved then. I prefer to use Time Machine but other people have other preferences.<br/>- the Seagate icon is seen at the top right whenever the Seagate drive is on but it seems that, when you click on it, the 'Home' option does not allow you to recover data from there as I guess, once you select the Mac only option and the Time Machine as the default recovery app, then you have to recover and view your data from Time Machine and Time Machine only. I guess when you select the Mac and PC option, then the Seagate Icon, and later, app shall allow you access to the data. The Seagate app only allows you to get the latest update. (When Mac only/Time Machine mode is chosen at the beginning)<br/>- it seems quiet and doesn't get too hot. I unplug it sometimes as I heard that that stretches the life of the drive. Opinions differ sharply about this.<br/>- I don't know if you can change the setting from Mac only to Mac and PC once you make the selection and format the drive. You may need to research further.<br/>- a Seagate recovery app is downloadable but I am not sure if you need to pay a fee to use it or if it is free. Hopefully I (and you) never get to find out.</span>

<span> more than satisfies those requirements. By now, the dimensions of an external drive are almost standard; the Backup Plus occupies a similar footprint to that of the Expansion Desktop and the My Book. Unlike the Expansion Desktop however, all the faces of the Backup Plus form a right-angle with each other, so technically you could stand the unit vertically if you desire, though I would not do it myself since it's not specifically not designed for it and it's not the most stable position available.<br/><br/>Similar to the Expansion Desktop and the My Book, the Backup Plus powers on as soon as electricity is supplied; there is no dedicated on/off switch on these devices. The enclosure design of the Backup Plus is a refinement to that of the Expansion Desktop, there are now more grilles and vents to facilitate air circulation to keep the drive cool. However, I find the activity indicator light of the Backup Plus to have a very soft pulse. Simply put, the light flashes indicating drive activity are not that easy to distinguish; the light exhibits a glowing effect rather than a conventional binary on/off pulse. The effect is visually appealing, though I'd have preferred something slightly more distinct.<br/><br/>The Backup Plus is USB 3.0 capable and I receive transfer rates from 65 MB/s to 90 MB/s depending on the number of files transferred. I experience similar performance with the Expansion Desktop and My Book, hence these speeds are within expectations. Like the My Book, the Backup Plus comes with backup software preloaded on the drive for installation though I have never used them. The unit can function perfectly fine as a drag-and-drop solution if you prefer to sort your backups manually. For completeness, I will also mention here that the Expansion Desktop does not come with any preloaded backup software.<br/><br/>As far as I know, the Backup Plus does not employ any mandatory encryption methods on data stored to the drive. This is simply a common drive behavior aligning to my expectations however, not a special feature exclusive to the Backup Plus.<br/><br/>The </span>

<span>, the most tangible refinement of the Backup Plus would probably be the enhanced ventilation from the new enclosure design. Otherwise, I do not really observe any other material difference between the two models, especially since I do not use the supplied backup software. This does not imply that the Backup Plus is not worthwhile. Rather, it shows how high the bar currently stands for external drives and the Backup Plus performs reasonably well by these standards. If your computing environment is fairly warm, the Backup Plus would probably be the better choice. For myself, I simply scout for the cheaper price between the two models.<br/><br/>As for the </span>
