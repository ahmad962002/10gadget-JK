<span>For the money, this thing works well.  Takes great day pictures and okay night pictures.  The batteries last a long time, it's very energy efficient.  I've tried about 7 or 8 models and most go through batteries really quickly.  It's easy to program and the latch keeps ants out - I've had several models become infested with ants.</span>

<span>09/08/22. Dont waste your money on this company! I bought two of these.... worked great for ab a month. Then an "update" was required. As soon as I did this, it stopped hardly sending pics. I only get a couple every other day or so, and they are of nothing...like the camera missed whatever was there. So I looked at my account to contact "support" and noticed they were double charging me. Each plan is supposed to support 3 cams. They charge you full price for each cam. I tried emailing several times, nothing... tried calling...set on hold for over an hour twice and noone ever picked up. This company is a joke and their updates crash your cams.  Apparently all of this is well known. There are fb pages dedicated to just these complaints.  Do yourself a favor and find another company.</span>

<span>I have two of these at my cabin. One camera is covering the driveway.  I like knowing if anyone is walking up the driveway when I'm not there. I also can tell how much snow has fallen since the last time I had the driveway plowed. The cabin is off grid with solar panels and batteries. The second camera covers the cabin and solar panels. I have an alarm system that runs by batteries, so it's helpful to know if the solar panels are covered with snow and not keeping the batteries charged. It's also interesting to see an occasional deer or turkey walk by. I like getting an automatic photo every day, so I know the cameras are working and the status of the driveway snow and solar panels.</span>

Product Description   Super sharp screw that makes it easy to screw into tree 360 degrees of rotational adjustment and 220 degrees of vertical adjustment Supports all trail cameras with 1/4" x 20 threaded insert on bottom Great for placing trail camera in exact desired location.   From the Manufacturer   Compact Easy-to-use Inexpensive. We have designed what we believe will become the #1 selling trail camera mounting device in the hunting industry. This patent pending design easily screws into any tree and has a full 360 degrees of rotational adjustment and 220 degrees of vertical adjustment. Once installed into the tree simply screw the trail camera onto the threaded end of the camera mount and rotate into desired position. Now screw the camera locking knob up and against the bottom of the camera to hold that position. Continue by loosening the 3/8" wing nut of the vertical adjustment and pivot camera into position and re-tighten wing nut. This simple, compact and sturdy design provides a dependable means for supporting all trail cameras with the 1/4" x 20 threaded insert on the bottom.

<span>This product is inexpensive yet well made with a quality feel. Makes it very easy to position &amp; point a camera exactly where you want it.

<span>First the good: Out to about 20' range it operates reasonably well, and it will work reliably for a couple of days.<br/><br/>Now the bad:<br/>-The set of batteries that came with it lasted over a week.

I estimate that this camera would eat $30 worth of non-rechargeable batteries per month.<br/>-There's no way to access the pics without shutting down the camera and taking out the memory card. It isn't wifi-capable and to connect via cell phone you have to buy extra hardware and get your video off the cloud via an app.<br/>-Every time you replace the batteries you need to reset the clock, calendar, and settings.<br/><br/>I guess I'd describe this as sort of a toy trail cam that isn't really up to snuff.</span>

<span>I bought two of these about a year ago and the results are a mixed bag.  One of the cameras has developed a leak and periodically the lens fogs up.  At some point the electronics are going to crap out.  The other camera works well except that occasionally the night vision does not work.  It attempts to capture an image or video, but the intermittently, the output is very dark.  The cellular service works well, and the app is very easy to setup and use.

I waved my arms and everything and set the nighttime flash range at all three different settings but did not make difference.

</ul>

After years of customer requests. We have finally developed a trail camera holder that will universally attach to most "t-post" style fence posts that are commonly used by farmers across the country. The t-post trail camera holder quickly attaches to any side of the t-post by simply unscrewing the threaded knob far enough that the holder will slide over and around the post. Continue by screwing the knob to tighten the knob threads against the t-post until the holder is securely mounted. Once the trail camera holder is securely fastened to the t-post you can now attach your trail camera to the threaded end of the adjustable camera holder. Once the camera is installed you can now rotate Tour camera into the desired position and tighten the wing nuts to hold that position.

<span>I was able to make this work for my uses but it may not work for everyone.<br/>First, the screw is way too short for connecting it to the T-post. Maybe it works on the kind in the photo but the kind I have are the stamped kind and I had to use a longer 1/4" bolt to get it tight enough to stay put.<br/>Second, and this is the part that may not work for everyone is if your camera is like mine and has the threaded hole in the back and not the bottom you will have no left to right adjustment and will be looking straight down the "fence line". Since I am using mine on a standalone T-post I can place it wherever i want and so it isn't a problem for me but if you are using it to look out perpendicular from a fence line it won't work for you.<br/>If the bolt was longer I would've given 5 stars, at least it wasn't metric so I used a random bolt from the coffee can...</span>

<span>I wanted a cheap adjustable mount for my trail camera. Eventually I wanted to permanently affix several of them at different locations in my yard and also in a woodland preserve adjacent to my neighborhood. So I compared the Amazon reviews of 4 different models. I was skeptical of the bad reviews of this product. Although it's price was more than I had in mind, it was still a low risk experiment. The main gripe repeated by its reviewers is that it's auger tip is too blunt for convenient usage. However, I figured that the auger tip could be either sharpened to a point with a fine file, or that I could simply make a starter hole with a hammer and nail.<br/><br/>Sure enough, the auger tip on mine was blunt. And although the auger is quite soft (aluminum alloy) and easy to file down, inexplicably ( and much to my frustration ) it would just keep getting shorter without ever becoming pointy. Enough was enough, and so finally I installed it via my aforementioned plan-B ( nailing a pilot hole ).<br/><br/>It works very nicely with my GardePro E6 camera. I have a cutoff half-gallon plastic juice bottle inverted over my camera ( see attached photo ) for rainfall shielding. However, this arrangement presents a much bigger wind profile. Last night we had very brisk wind persisting for several hours. Yet throughout all that turbulence this mount secured my camera with plenty of rigidity to spare. I got 9 great videos, and ZERO videos having no visible animals. So evidently the mount remained rigid enough in the wind so as not to cause false triggering of the motion sensor. This is attributed to its compact simplicity, which presents a SHORTER LEVER LENGTH for wind forces against my inadvertant windcatcher of a camera rainshield. Hence, I imagine it's actually more rigid than longer mounts that protrude further out from the tree. There are however one or two even simpler, more compact mounts than this one, but they don't provide as many axes of angular adjustment.<br/><br/>Thus, it's elegantly more compact, probably has superior overall functionality, and it's cost is within the ballpark of other auger type camera tree mounts that are fully adjustable. And since it's aluminum and plastic parts can't rust, it's perfectly suited for permanent outdoor installation. Just what I wanted.<br/><br/>At this juncture I want to refute the other two "faults", which other reviewers have ranted about. If the mount wobbles about the large T-knob screw clamp ( the T fastener closest to the auger ), then you simply haven't torqued it enough. And the 1/4-20 UNC threaded stud for the camera poses no serious problem, unless you lack the mechanical sense to :<br/>1) First back the wingnut well away from the camera.<br/>2) Then gently rotate the entire camera all the way down the threaded stud until it just "bottoms out". The wingnut should not be making contact.<br/>3) Next, back the camera out a partial-full turn so that it's pointing in the generally desired direction. Now you have the maximum thread engagement.<br/>4) Then back out the wingnut for whatever tightness against the camera you require; either temporarily or finally. And there's absolutely no need to add a jamnut to the assembly, as one mechanically challenged reviewer has remarked. After all, the wingnut already functions as a jamnut.<br/><br/>It's impossible to damage either the camera or this nifty little mount if you follow the above "common" sense instructions.</span>

<span>Perfect camera mount. Only thing that would improve it would be optional ground stakes. The weight of the camera causes it to tip on a windy day. To prevent that I placed it in a bucket of sand.</span>
