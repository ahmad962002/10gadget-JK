<div class="slideshow-container">
<blockquote><em><div class="a-row a-spacing-small review-data"><span class="a-size-base review-text review-text-content" data-hook="review-body">
<span class="cr-original-review-content">Ya llevo con esta laptop casi un año y estas son mis impresiones:<br/><br/>1. Lo que más me gustó es la capacidad de expansión: ahora tiene 32 GB de RAM (crucial 3200MHz), dos discos NVMe (256GB, y 1 TB) y uno SATA de 1 TB.<br/>2. El rendimiento para los juegos es aceptable: Halo Infinite corre a unos 90 FPS a 1080p y calidad media-baja de configuración. Otros juegos menos exigentes corren por encima de los 100 FPS.<br/>3. Hablando de la pantalla, la tasa de refresco es alta, no es tan cómoda frente a la luz directa (el brillo no es muy alto) y la representación de colores no es la mejor. No lo recomendaría para edición de video o fotografía, a menos que se contara con un monitor secundario de alta calidad.<br/>4. Para desarrollo de software es un gran equipo, el procesador, aunque ya de dos generaciones atrás, responde bien. Windows inicia inmediatamente y funciona bien para virtualización.<br/>5. La batería dura máximo 3 horas y media.<br/>6. El puerto USB C no tiene capacidades de carga de la laptop o de salida de video. Sería ideal que un tuviera un lector de tarjetas integrado.<br/>7. No tiene el switch MUX (tampoco es de esperar en el rango de precios).<br/>8. El teclado se siente bien, el touchpad después del primer mes empezó a mostrar un brillo como si tuviera años de uso, sin embargo, mantiene su funcionamiento normal.<br/>9. No es un computador muy vistoso y la calidad de los plásticos no es la mejor. Más pesado que un equipo no orientado a juegos pero sigue siendo transportable.<br/>10. La cámara y el micrófono son aceptables para videollamadas. Creo que los streamers preferirán conectar mejores dispositivos.<br/><br/>Conclusión: revisar el precio y comparar. Si hay equipos con i5 o i7 de 12° generación o con RTX 3060, a un precio similar, sería mejor ir por esas opciones. Si el presupuesto es muy ajustado o está unos 200 dólares por debajo de la competencia, el Nitro 5 vale la pena.</span><span class="cr-translated-review-content aok-hidden"></span>

<span>Keep expectations realistic do your research for what kind of games your gonna play how this hardware stacks up to running sed games and your gonna have a good time and be happy with your buy. The only ball drop by Microsoft or Acer was i had to download some additional C++ code to get some games running how they should. I play fighting games and this laptop suits my needs and runs the games without issue should also be enough to handle street fighter 6 with no issues playing more demanding games performance may decline. You also need to understand you absolutely will not be gaming without being plugged into the charger you will just gimp the component's if you don't play plugged into a outlet and have a bad time. Make sure you set up the PC to optimize performance and take full advantage of its dedicated nividia card and intel processor the ram can be upgraded but i would only put 16gigs in max the 8 gig stick is okay. The native 144hz screen is impressive for the price this laptop costs all in all if you know what your doing and know how games will run on the hardware that you want to play you will be happy with the buy. Understand this all depends on the type of games you want the hardware to play and what those games will be asking the system to preform i cant stress that fact enough please do your research before you buy that means you parents of children google and youtube are your friend when it comes to this.</span>

<span>I've only had this for a day now, so I can't speak to longevity. All in all I'm pleased with this laptop. It's lightweight but packs a punch still. Set up and updating was quick and easy. It's a great utilization of space, only a slim border around the screen and keyboard.<br/><br/>A few first impression negatives: you can see in other review images that it comes with 5 semi permanent stickers, (Nvidia, Intel, Alexa, 144hz, and a long feature banner). That was a bummer because they weren't in the product image, and they look awful (not to mention some were crooked). Thankfully they're removable, though I had to use glass cleaner to get rid of residue from one. Not a big deal though. The frame is very lightweight and flexible. The feet keep it raised which is good for cooling, but any pressure on the middle makes it flex, which I don't love. It's not going to crumble, but it's definitely a step down from my Lenovo with a metal body. You're paying for the internal components, not the frame.</span>

<span>My son sent me the page for this, knowing what my desired specs and budget were.  Then I read the reviews and was almost scared away.  He talked me into at least trying it and I am so so glad I did!!<br/><br/>I love everything about it.  I am not a gamer, the games I play generally do not require high specs.  However, I do photo and video editing, and a lot of multi-tasking.  This laptop works well for everything I do.<br/><br/>I have not experienced any problems with the display, you do have to make sure the cord clicks into the back, and the keyboard has a nice feel to it (I type a lot).  My only cons are the battery life (3-4 hours), and I do wish I could adjust the light on keyboard.  I don't mind the red, but do find it annoying that it doesn't light up until the first keystroke.  I often use the computer in a dim or dark room, so finding that first key is annoying,  There should be a light up key.Like hitting space to light up and it doeant make a space if used before typing anything else.  That is a minor thing tho.<br/><br/>Bottom line, I am very pleased with this laptop and hope it lasts me as many years as my previous one did.</span>

<span>I'm not an acer fan, as acer was like the hyundai's of the pc tech world in my book, but I needed a laptop for my daughter and this one fit the bill.<br/><br/>So far so good, I'd say build quality is fairly decent, it's slimmer than I expected. Performance wise, obviously it's no beast, but it gets the job done. What's really great about this is the fact that the ram is upgradeable to 64GB, but I'll just purchase an 8GB stick to add to it.<br/><br/>There is room for a 2.5" SSD. The NVME is also removeable, so while there's no sd card slot, storage is fully expandable in a better way.<br/><br/>Having a backlit keyboard with #pad is excellent.<br/><br/>Webcam quality is ok, nothing to talk about there, 720p 30fps max, but as mentioned before, gets the job done.<br/><br/>Even with only 4Gb Ram, it still ran smoothly despite having several Chrome windows open with multiple tabs. Installed minecraft java edition for her, it was able to play set at 7 chunks render distance, and not very many settings dialed down and still get 60fps (not that she cared about fps), so I still think you may be able to play some titles at 720p maybe medium settings, but i haven't checked it yet.<br/><br/>Screen is not bad, viewing angles are quite good and bright enough.<br/><br/>The speaker are not loud but audio quality is fairly decent, especially given how slim the laptop is. Your phone may go louder, but it won't scrape your ear canal.<br/><br/>Battery life is average I'd say.<br/><br/>All in all, this is a laptop that is more expensive than it should be, AS ARE ALL THAT FALL IN THIS PRICE POINT, but definitely compared against all the others I've sifted through, it's the best. In summary, it is because:<br/><br/>1. Ability to upgrade internal nvme storage + add 2.5" ssd<br/><br/>2. As with internal storage, ram isn't soldered on like the other brand laptops and can be upgraded<br/><br/>3. Latest WiFi and Bluetooth technology<br/><br/>4. Backlit keyboard with number pad and fingerprint scanner on touchpad<br/><br/>5. Inclusion of an ethernet port. Especially helpful if you need a stable internet connection.<br/><br/>6. Windows 11 ready<br/><br/>7. Decent display with good viewing angles<br/><br/>8. Decent quad core apu<br/><br/>9. USB-C also available on chassis and overall, decent I/O<br/><br/>It's a solid buy if you're looking for a laptop within it's price range at the time of this review. It offers the most features and flexibility vs the competition.</span>

<span>As a college student, this is very useful and fast from my experience after having it for a month. And it was also a great budget price so for anyone who needs a cheap fast computer, I think this is a great place to start. Just a heads up: the fan will sound very loud when you are first setting it up but it is very very quiet. It’ll sound loud when there are setups or stuff like that. But overall, I am very happy with this purchase. I also have heard that people complain about the backlit keyboard because there’s a timer but you can actually change it to where it can stay on until you press the button again to turn it off. To change the timed keyboard to always on, go to your computer settings, type “Recovery” and click that and look for “Advanced startup” then you might have to wait for it to restart. After that, there should be a blue screen and click “Troubleshoot” and then “Advanced Options” and then “UEFI firmware settings” and you should look for “keyboard timeout” or something like that and click “disable” and then just confirm the settings and once it restarts again, then it should would. Keep in mind that the fan will be loud throughout the entire process. Of course there’s always YouTube videos. Hope this helped!!</span>

<span>The computer is fine, what you see is what you get, it was packaged well and arrived in pristine condition.<br/><br/>I was extremely disappointed to find Windows 11 when I booted up considering the ad prominently states Windows 10.  It'll cost me extra to put literally any other operating system on it before I can use it, either for a license or in time getting it working in the case of Linux.  If, like me, you are looking for a relatively recent computer system that does not have Windows 11 on it you should keep looking.  Otherwise jump in, the water is fine.</span>

<span>I'm writing this for a typical user, using plain language, so they know what they are getting into.<br/><br/>I've been in the IT profession for 27 years. For most of that time I fixed other people's machines for a living; dealing with the demands of an engineering workforce. I also use PhotoShop a lot on my home workstation, which is a monster configured for performance, so yes, I know what I'm talking about.<br/><br/>I bought this laptop, knowing it was a toy. The only thing I'm going to used if for is surfing the web and checking email using a browser. I don't need it to do anything crazy, but I want to have more control over what little data I plan to store on it than a Chromebook. For the record this was to replace a 6 year old HP Pavilion x2 Detachable. So a 5 star rating means it does everything I want it to do at least as well as the machine it replaced, and not my graphics monster. I'm approaching this review as if I was a typical customer.<br/><br/>My preferred browser is Opera, so I had to get this machine out of S Mode to install it. It's the only change I made to the initial setup from HP. S Mode is not it's fault, that's a Windows thing. We don't deal with S Mode in the corporate world, so it took a little research to discover that removing it is an app off the MS Store.<br/><br/>My first impression was it's pretty terrible. Opera frequently had lag while typing and that isn't good at all. Edge, the default browser wasn't much better. Very slow to load pages, and a lot of buffering on youtube. I almost returned it, until I mucked around a bit and experimented. I found that Avast Secure Browser gave me the performance I expected from a low end machine. But it took work that is beyond an average user's knowledge and skills to make it adequate, and that's a serious problem.<br/><br/>Honestly, if it came optimized the way I made, it, I'd give it a 4, maybe 5. BUT it took work beyond the skills of a normal user... that would make it a 3, if you only wanted to do web browsing and email. BUT (again) it's offering Office 365 free for a year, and based on what I saw, there is absolutely no way this machine can handle Office.... so that's why it gets a 2.<br/><br/>If you're looking for a light weight low power machine for web surfing and email, that has better data management than a Chromebook, then this is an adequate machine. Do not expect it to be good enough for a child's school computer... please.</span>

<span>This Chromebook is dirt cheap and would be great for a student on a budget or someone who just needs to use a few apps and browse the internet.  I use it as a writing laptop, as I don't want to take my expensive, bulky gaming laptop all over the place.<br/><br/>Despite being plastic, it does seem to be solid.  The matte finish is a fingerprint magnet, though it's not a big deal.  The battery life is good, and as far as Chromebook keyboards go, it's fine to type on and better than some I have encountered in the past.<br/><br/>It's fast enough, though it's not zippy and will struggle with heavy apps or opening too many at once.  The screen is also not exactly beautiful and looks very dated.  Still, do you really need a nice screen on a $100 Chromebook?  You also need to be aware that Chromebooks basically have an update expiration date, so before you think you're getting a sweet deal on one, be sure to look up when it will stop receiving updates.  I believe this one is good until 2026 or 2027, which is enough time to get enough bang for your buck.<br/><br/>If you're aware of this Chromebook's limitations, this may be a nice buy.  It suits my needs, and honestly I can't stomach the idea of paying much for a Chromebook in the first place.  I won't feel sick if it gets lost or stolen while I lug it around, but it does what I need it to do well enough.</span>

<span>My job is entirely Google based.  I bought this as a second work computer because my company laptop is a Thinkpad and it's heavy.  I just wanted to leave that at home and have a nice sleek backup for any work tasks I'd need to do in a pinch out of the house.  I couldn't be more pleased with this.  It's light, fast, and the battery life is fantastic.  Lenovos are known for having great keyboards and this is the best one I've used on a small laptop.  It also doesn't look or feel cheap.  The only thing that shows 'budget' is the screen, as it won't blow you away.  But it's still very solid and surprisingly good from the side, where most screens in this price range are garbage viewed from an angle.  If you are in the market for a laptop, and you are in the probably 95% of the public that absolutely doesn't really need an $800 laptop for what they use it for, rush out and buy this one while the price is still insane.</span>

<span>I purchased the Acer Chromebook Spin 311 to use as a bedside entertainment center, so I wanted something that could stream and have quality screen resolution.  I liked the idea of a device that I could position with the screen set back (open like a laptop) or set forward (flip it and go triangular, baby!); I also needed a reliable blue tooth as I wear comfy headphones that I can sleep in.  I have an extensive music collection that I keep on an external SSD and I absolutely love MediaMonkey because of it's customizable interface on it's Window's app (I assumed the ChromeOS version would be very similar - my first major stumble).<br/><br/>First, the positive:  The device itself is fantastic.  Everything about it feels sturdy, the touchscreen is responsive (though, I will say there are times when I feel I have to hit an app 2 or 3 times to activate).  The screen resolution and sound quality are lovely for a device of this size and price - don't go expecting studio quality here, but the streaming was beautiful.  The visuals are not pixelated; it's as good as watching on a television (only smaller).  Oh, and I will say I love the fact that the USB-C port is on both sides, which makes it easier to plug in on any side (it's the little things).<br/><br/>Performance is great, I get no lag and I've had no issues streaming Netflix, Hulu or Disney+.  I just realized I haven't tried watching Twitch or Youtube on this.  I'll download those apps and if I have any problems with them, I'll update this review and let you know.<br/><br/>I have one grouse, and it's kind of a biggie:  The apps are terrible.  It was so dismaying at first, I did actually contemplate sending the device back.  I slept on it and decided I was going to stick it out.  In truth, part of my disappointment is that the ChromeOS version of MediaMonkey is disappointing.  When it came down to it, I tried a whole slew of music apps and I wound up settling on the music app that annoyed me the least (VLC).  Most of the apps have ads that are intrusive, and even the ones I thought about paying for just don't seem worth the value.<br/><br/>Even simple apps like an alarm clock or a blue tooth manager:  I downloaded several different ones, and I'm continually settling on the app that annoys me the least or seems to be able to handle some of what I would like.  I even tried to find a power button app because I just wanted to turn off the computer with a single, on screen button push - despite over a dozen apps that claimed to do this, all of them performed poorly and one you had to close out an ad before it would turn off (really?!?).<br/><br/>In choosing whether or not to keep it, I had to weigh the solid build and reliable performance against an operating system that was under par for Windows or Mac.<br/><br/>That said, I'm very glad I kept this little guy.  In the end, it's a reliable little entertainment unit and it's wonderful where it counts: It's a great streamer (with a beautiful picture) and it plays music that I love and I can leave it in place and listen on my blue tooth headphones while I wander all over the house.  The apps are a shame, but honestly, given the price point here, it's a good deal and I can live with it.</span>

<span>This works pretty well if you are just going to be web browsing or watching some videos. It's a bit slow in terms of installing/running apps. But I find it's small size, lightweight and good battery life make it very convenient to use when you don't really want to haul around a full size laptop. I might in the future consider spending a little bit more for a faster processor. But that's about the only criticism I have for this.</span>

<span>I have two MacBook Airs (MBA), a 13" and a 11, both with the previous form factor (the wide, body colored bezel around the screen, 1280x800 resolution) and this new 13" MBA improves upon it in every way (almost) and makes it nearly perfect.<br/><br/>Good:<br/><br/>- SCREEN looks great!  2560x1600 resolution is bright and sharp and looks good with the thin black bezel.  I usually don't go above 50% brightness.<br/><br/>- KEYBOARD is good.  Some have mentioned that it still sucks, but I find it much better than the older MBAs that I own and better than say, the Magic Keyboard.  Even with a thin silicone keyboard cover I find the typing experience to be much better and I can type faster and with fewer mistakes.<br/><br/>- BATTERY LIFE is fantastic.  Haven't done any real testing yet and obviously it depends on a lot of factors (wifi usage, video streaming, HD vs 4k video viewing/processing/etc., screen brightness, type of app being used, etc.) but for my usage (mostly web browsing, video viewing on YouTube, accessing VPN for work (Citrix, EPIC), etc., it has been great.  Easily tops 10 hours and super impressed so far.<br/><br/>- LOOKS GREAT.  Love the newer (I know that the actual exterior design is a few years old by now) design, looks and feels great.  Form factor is nice and it is a reasonable weight.<br/><br/>- NO FAN.  That's awesome, as it not only stays quiet all the time but you also do not need to worry about blocking any fan vents on the bottom or back of the case while you have it on your lap.  Pretty amazing really for a laptop to have no fans.<br/><br/>- PERFORMANCE.  It works great so far on what I have used it for, which is not terribly a lot, but it is what it is for a laptop using Apple silicon for the first time.  For just day to day use and things like Chrome, Office (Word, Excel), Citirx, EPIC, etc., it has been super smooth and fast.  Have not tried gaming yet but do not have high hopes given it is the base model with 7-core GPU.  Also, things like start up are noticeably faster with the M1 versus my 2020 iMac 27" (top end) with Intel chips.<br/><br/>- TOUCH ID is great still.  Works very fast and the button does not get greasy (which makes it not work well) like the old iPhone home buttons.  On the other hand, it should really have Face ID at this point.<br/><br/>- APPLE ECOSYSTEM is great as usual and a real reason to get this MBA.  Apple Watch easily unlocks it (so you do not really need Face ID if you have the watch).  You can easily send/receive files using AirDrop or cast using AirPlay.  And so on and so forth.<br/><br/>- BIG SUR comes preinstalled but you need to update to get 11.0.1.<br/><br/>NOT GOOD:<br/><br/>- WEBCAM still sucks.  Still low resolution and just does not look good in FaceTime, Teams, etc.  Shame that Apple is so slow to upgrade webcams on the Macs (the 27" iMac FINALLY upgraded to 1080p front cams only a couple months ago... I got one and it looks so much better than this MBA's camera).<br/><br/>- ONLY 2 PORTS.  Sad that this thing has only 2 USB-C ports (that cover thunderbolt 3, USB 3.1, charging, DisplayPort).  Given that it is used to charge, it leaves only one USB-C port for other use, pretty lame.  I wish they had squeezed (I think it would fit) a USB-A port so that I could plug in my wireless mouse USB-A dongle as I have never liked any bluetooth mouse, or at least one more USB-C port.<br/><br/>- NEW TECH (Apple silicon) means the M1-optimized apps are still being rolled out, e.g. Photoshop still not available at release.<br/><br/>- BATTERY still cannot be removed, no surprise here, but means that like all Apple mobile tech it will have a useable lifespan determined at least partly by the non-removable battery.  Easier to have an iPhone's battery replaced than a MBA I would imagine but hopefully it maintains a high level of performance for 4 years at the minimum.<br/><br/>OVERALL:<br/><br/>A few negatives (mostly the webcam) but enough significant improvements that this MBA is really a no-brainer for anyone needing a non-power notebook compute, especially if s/he is already in the Apple ecosystem.  Love it so far!</span>

<span>I recently migrated to Apple after many years using a wide variety of PCs running Windows or Linux. I decided to make that move after Apple's introduction of the M1 processor, which has been proven to be an excellent hardware platform. Now. of course, the M2 has been released, but, depending on your needs, the 2020 Macbook Air with the M1 will save you some money while still delivering outstanding performance and some of the most attractively and perfectly manufactured hardware. You can search the Internet for professional reviews of the Macbook Air, but I feel confident you'll find plenty to verify what I'm saying.<br/><br/>The Retina display is beautiful. The sound system is superior to any other laptop I have owned or used. The battery holds up all day under typical use, and I can verify that the battery holds its charge well for at least a week while the notebook is powered off. The Apple OS (Monterey) is smooth and fast, and I was able to learn my way around in it quickly. When you need help, a Google search will yield tons of tips quickly, or you can avail yourself of Apple support.<br/><br/>I will say that the Air is a little short on USB ports, lacks a built-in card slot, and, of course, is not equipped with a touchscreen. However, I have run a USB hub from one of the two Thunderbolt ports, and there seems to be enough power to support my flash drives and card readers...even a portable DVD-burner. As far as a touchscreen goes, I have that on a Dell laptop I run Linux on, but I never use it...guess I'm a mouse or touchpad guy.<br/><br/>The aluminum housing is beautifully machined and finished, the keyboard has a very nice touch, the battery seems to charge quickly, and the Air is light at under 3 lbs.<br/><br/>One last thing! I have been a heavy user of both Google and Microsoft services, and I have found that Apple provides ample support for integrating those services into the Mac environment. I run Google's Backup and Sync and Microsoft's OneDrive with no problems. My AVG subscription allows me to use my antivirus software on both Mac OS and Windows machines.<br/><br/>I have no regrets for this purchase. Actually, the Air was my 3rd M1 Mac. I also have an iMac and a Mac Mini. They all work together very well!</span>

<span>As far as the computer itself - the processing speed, memory, time to boot up, lack of crashes, and overall value it's a great laptop. The aluminum body is strong, and still lightweight, it's a little cold however if you put it on your bare legs on a cool day! My only big problem with the laptop is the keyboard. It is backlit which is great, but the letters are so thin and small, and there's so little contrast between the white letters and the silver keys they are very hard to read. Normally when I'm typing something like a letter that's not an issue, but when I'm trying to peck at the keys to enter a password, it demands my full attention. Other than that I'm very happy with this laptop.</span>

<span>I needed a new computer for school, and I employed the help of a friend to weed my way through the overwhelming amount of laptops out there. He came back with this gem, and so far, I am happy with my purchase from Amazon. The Acer website and other outlets list this model for $749, but I snagged this laptop for under $700 including tax. It comes with Windows 10, but it did an update to Windows 11, which I did not like, but I was able to revert back to 10 with ease. The battery life is outstanding. It's lightweight, very portable, and easy to use. Seamless design and interface. Speaker quality is good. Just to make sure I made the right purchase, I did further research on this laptop and compared it to other brands/models. Very happy with my decision to buy this brand and model. Would recommend and buy again.</span>
