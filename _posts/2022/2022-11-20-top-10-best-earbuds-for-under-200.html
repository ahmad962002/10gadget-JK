<span>I think they are great headphones. I’ve gotten a pair for me and my wife. Unfortunately the only complaint I have is that I got sent the wrong color. But would definitely recommend these headphones. They are comfortable, cheap, and the sound quality is pretty great. I use them to watch videos on my phone and for hands free calling since my audio went out on my phone I use these everyday all day and they hold a charge for the full day so that’s a plus.</span>

<blockquote><em><div class="a-row a-spacing-small review-data"><span class="a-size-base review-text review-text-content" data-hook="review-body">
<span>I love these! The color is cute, and for the price, the sound quality is pretty good! They have good battery life (mine went about 6 hours of nonstop use before I got a low battery warning) and seem to have a really good distance range too - I live in a 3 story house and I can easily go to the top floor with my phone on the bottom with no interruption.<br/><br/>The only reason I knock a star off is that the fit is not quite just right - they’re a little too big to get a completely perfect fit, and if I move around a lot I need to adjust them a decent amount to make sure they’re secure (I’ve never really felt like they’d actually fall out though).<br/><br/>If you want a good solid pair of budget ear buds, get these! We have a JBL wireless speaker and love it so this seemed like the obvious choice, and we weren’t disappointed.</span>

<span>These are JBL. The quality is always there with them. These are great sounding and great fitting headphones. They’re great in power, range and battery life.<br/>BUT.. whoever designed the case should be severely reprimanded! They are a pain in the butt to get out of the case! 😑<br/>Other than that, great deal for the money.</span>

<p> </p>
<blockquote><em><div class="a-row a-spacing-small review-data"><span class="a-size-base review-text review-text-content" data-hook="review-body">
<span>I'd say the bass is a bit lacking but the overall sound isn't too bad, especially if you get these on sale like I did. I'd have to say though, I feel the issue with the bass mainly comes down to the earbuds design and how they don't full go into your ear, tried on all eartips and I still have this issue. However when I push them into my ear slightly it's obvious the bass would be more noticeable if they were just a bit more smug in your ear. Overall though not bad for the price</span>

<span>So I never write reviews online, but feel compelled to do so for this purchase because of how blown away I am by these earbuds.<br/>I can't find my t14's for the life of me and, upon the pre-gym self-loathing in my truck today (lol) at the thought of a workout without them, I began browsing Amazon for the same pair.<br/>Sadly, I couldn't find them, but I am happy to have happened upon these!<br/>Not only did they show up in less than 6 hours from the moment I ordered them in the gym parking lot (seriously Amazon, this is getting a bit scary haha!), but I just tested them out and am blown away at the sound quality I received for only having spent $25 (plus tax it came out to around 27)! They paired in under a minute as well.<br/>I'm deaf in my left ear, so wearing both buds can be superfluous, but these actually give off enough bass to give me the sensation of "hearing" on my deaf side. For those who dont understand, because I only went deaf in that ear 2 years ago, it helps u feel less "imbalanced", so it's a HUGE plus for me with my vertigo. You can still tell there's some sort of sound happening.<br/>The only downside I can see is that, when I went to test them, they seemed a bit larger than my old ones. However, I haven't worn my old ones in a very long time, as I've been going to the gym with a friend and enjoying her company instead, so I'm hoping my ears just have to adapt to them.<br/>Overall, I'm very pleased with my purchase and hope you are too if you order these! :)<br/><br/>Ps- the packaging they came in was also very nice. They're encased in the black foam you'd typically see in gun cases, or cases for musical instruments and such, not some cheap plastic. Not sure if this matters, but it makes me feel like the company is just putting a little extra thought into their customer's experience!</span>

<span>I had been searching for moderately priced wireless earbuds for my Samsung S22 because I always forget that there's no earphone hole. I was a little sus on the price of these, but after a couple weeks of using them, the sound is really clear and the battery life lasts quite a long time. Not sure about the noise canceling though since I typically only use one side most of the time. I guess that part is so-so because I can still hear the background noises when I use both sides. I'm still getting used to wearing them because sometimes when I brush my hands too close to the earbuds, they fall out. Been careful not to go to the bathroom with them on in case they fall in. 😅</span>

<span>Not bad. I never noticed any real noise canceling but they connect quick and stay connected. Decent Bluetooth range. Good battery life. I've had similarly priced pairs that would loose connection between each ear buds and it would sound like you were listening to music through a fan. Not with these ones. For the price, a real good set. Would recommend.</span>

<span>O.K. I never thought I'd own a pair of beats earbuds, bud I do. And I have to stay, they're not bad. There's a (alright, there's a few) caveats, but not enough for me to return them. The build is the typically spun hardened plastic, of a oddly shaped buds that interestingly fit near perfectly. The buds are tiny, compared to many other brands. As mentioned they're oddly shaped, by two (also an oval shaped flat surfaced which is used to control the buds) angular sides and a round ball in front, where the canal protrudes that you attach your tips. The fit isn't bad, and once sealed it doesn't move around, or fall out whilst doing certain activities. I use XL sized silicone tips. I find they work best for me, for almost every bud I've owned or tested over the years.<br/><br/>If the fit is too short, you can always use double, or even triple flange tips. Which I use on occasion. Depends on the buds I'm fitting in question. That extra length can help get the seal you need for the most optimal sound reproduction.  Throughout this year I have tried a plethora of buds. From Sony's XM3, to Audio Technica CKS5TW And Nuarl (I plan to get them again, when funds permit) N6Pro's , which I actually (they have a really good sound, rich luscious bass, sweet and engaging mids, and to top it off, a sparkling treble, not over the top, mind you) liked, but the buttons were a little finicky. As to why I returned them.<br/>The biggest, most prevalent issue I came across was that most of them didn't fit properly, at all. I could barely get the XM3's in, and keep them in. As with Shures Aionic, another I liked and wanted desperately<br/>them to work out. Because they sounded great. The Studio buds are not a problem. It takes me seconds to insert and position them in my ears. The only (again, there's more than one) detraction I have, is that the  buds are easy activate whilst attempting to insert them into your ears. For me it's not a deal breaker. Oh, I almost forgot an important issue. And that is with the battery life. They average a minimum three plus hours. Which is not that long. Then again, who spends more than three hours listening to stuff ? Well, I do. These are for nighttime use mostly. I use them when my roomy has gone to bed. So I need to get an average fours plus. One night I got close to 5 hours. Guess it depends on usage.  What else can I say, other to try for yourself. . At the least, you can return them if you're not happy, right. I'm using them now, as I do at nights.<br/><br/>I'm going to buy the Philips Fidelio T1's. I bought and had to return for a replacement. But the delivery person did not deliver them, when they came. Why, I don't.. But I became infuriated and cancelled the order. to buy at a later date. I loved the sound. They have a hybrid configuration of a DD and a BA. For those who don't know the abbreviations, it's dynamic driver, and balanced amature drivers. That's , cause sound is impressive. And the price on them now, is 155$ A drop of a 100$ A good deal to me, for a worthy set of buds. all I'm gonna say for now. But I am going to acquire them I'll be editing removing any errors. But for now, enjoy. Hope it can help you decide</span>

<span>I bought these after initially buying and returning the ‘beats pro fit’ which advertised basically everything these do with the addition of the silicon piece to better secure the earbuds in your ear.<br/><br/>I returned those because that piece made them uncomfortable to wear for more than half an hour or so but their sound quality and especially their noise cancellation were phenomenal—they sounded a bit better than these do. Not by an extremely large margin but especially in regards to the active noise cancellation, the Pro Fit did it better and I’m not sure why since they’re nearly the same product but perhaps they have more differences internally than I realized.<br/><br/>I’m tempted to return these and re-order the Pro Fit and just trying to find a way to make them tolerable to wear because I miss the level of noise cancellation they achieved.<br/><br/>Alas, these are still great earbuds and I’ll need more time with them to make the decision of whether or not to keep them. From only a day’s use I can say that they’re far more comfortable to wear for extended periods and the charging case they come with is of better quality than that of the Pro Fit’s (which isn’t saying too much to be fair).<br/><br/>I’ll update this after I’ve had a chance to use them at the gym a few times.</span>

<span>I wanted to write a review that was as non biased as possible. I own a pair of AirPods Pro’s. I bought these beats for my job, where it can be it very loud. I didn’t want to run the risk of losing my AirPods. I saw the beats were on sale.<br/><br/>I like them a lot, for it to be a cheaper alternative for AirPod pros. The noise cancellation isn’t as good as the AirPod pros. In my opinion it’s not that much of a difference between the two. It’s noticeable difference but not an inconvenience either.<br/><br/>With either ANC or Transparency mood is on. The beats sacrifice some of the audio performance for either one. Sounds the same in either mood. When you turn noise control off, the bass, treble, and etc are amplified. For the AirPod pros it’s the complete opposite from the beats in terms of noise control. The bass is amplified in ANC or transparency mood; and sacrifices the audio performance with noise control off. Make sure to figure out what ear tips fit best in your ear to get the best quality.<br/><br/>To me they’re worth 89-110 dollars, I wouldn’t pay anything over it. Especially not at 150, but it’s a great quality for that price range I set if you can find it on sale. Whereas I’d pay full price for the Pros, and did.<br/><br/>All in all they’re a good quality pair of ear buds to get the job done. They’re a good cheaper alternative to AirPod pros. Would still serve as a great gift or to satisfy the average everydays needs.</span>

<span>The sound quality of these ear buds is excellent, as with other Beats products the bass response is superb, which is lacking in the AirPods, IMO. Understandably, it's difficult to pack a lot of bass amplification into a tiny set of wireless ear buds, but Beats managed to do so. They also work with my iPhone 12 Pro Max as seamlessly as the AirPods.<br/><br/>The fit is nice and they stay in my ears better than AirPods; however, I do NOT like the physical buttons being directly on the outside of the buds, opposite your ear canals. I often have to adjust my ear buds and push them back in my eyes to optimize sound because they tend to move around, and this pauses the sound every time - SUPER annoying and dated design flaw. Also, the noise cancellation is pretty lame - not nearly as good as the AirPod Pros. I can hardly tell the difference with it on/off. Lastly, I'm not a fan of the lack of magnetic charging - it is USB-C only. As much as I would love for everything to switch to USB-C, Apple seemingly refuses to let go of their Lightning port, so I still have mostly Lightning cables and thus it would be nice to have magnetic charging instead of just USB-C.<br/><br/>All in all, this a great product at a good price, but if noise cancellation is important to you, you might want to spend the extra $ on the AirPod Pros.</span>

Bose Sport Earbuds are designed to energize your exercise with acclaimed lifelike sound and a comfortable secure fit. Get ready to beat your personal best, again and again. Bose patented acoustic port design and premium, high-efficiency drivers combine to deliver big sound from a small acoustic package. Bose signature Volume-Optimized Active EQ automatically adjusts the bass, midrange, and treble based on how loud or soft you play your music. And Bose new StayHear Max tips create an airtight seal with your ear canal — critical for hearing the deep low notes that add impact and emotion to your music and for blocking the ambient noise around you so you can focus on your music and your workout. Bose Sport Earbuds come with three sizes of StayHear Max tips, so you can find the right fit for you. Every surface that touches your ear is made of soft silicone. Meanwhile, the unique umbrella-shaped tip and the extended flexible wing keep your Bose Sport Earbuds securely in place — without need of an ear hook — no matter how much you shake your head or jump up and down.Bose Sport Earbuds go through rigorous quality testing for durability. They’re also rated IPX4 for water resistance, which means they’re protected against sweat and light rain. The electronics inside are wrapped in special materials that protect them from moisture, so your earbuds stay in top shape, just like you. Bose Sport Earbuds feature a capacitive touch interface. On the right Earbud, tap to play or pause music and to answer calls. And on the left Earbud, double-tap to engage a Shortcut function of your choice like checking your battery level. If you get a phone call, instead of interrupting your workout, simply tap the right Earbud or press and hold it to reject. If you answer, you’ll hear the call clearly in both ears. Meanwhile, your caller will hear you clearly, too — thanks to the beam forming microphone array that separates your voice from surrounding noise.Bose Sport Earbuds provide up to 5 hours of battery life per charge. They’re charged by placing them in the included charging case. If the case is charged, it will automatically charge the earbuds. The status lights on each Earbud will pulse white, while they charge before turning solid white and then off when fully charged. When the case is fully charged, it can provide a 15-minute quick charge for up to 2 more hours or two full charges for up to 10 more hours.Bose Sport Earbuds offer complete freedom of movement. As long as you’re within 30 feet (9 meters) of your device, you’ll hear whatever you’re playing. And with Bose custom-designed antennas hidden inside each Earbud, dropouts are rare.Bose Sport Earbuds connect to the free Bose Music app, which lets you name your earbuds, set the controls the way you like them, check your battery, and more.

<span>Ordered these headphones two months ago when they released. I'm a pretty serious cyclist and I have used these nearly daily for my rides, which last anywhere from two to six hours. I also live in a tropical part of the US, so I tend to sweat a lot.<br/><br/>Before these earbuds, I was using Shure wired earbuds for my rides. Those earbuds were not necessarily meant for my type of training, especially when I sweat as much as I do when I ride. I landed on the Bose SoundSports for their proposed protection from sweat and their earbud design. I have used Bose SoundSports a couple of generations ago and I always preferred their emphasis on fitting the concha of the ear as opposed to the traditional inner ear canal fit.<br/><br/>Pros -<br/>* The fit is quite comfortable for me. I cannot stand traditional IEMs for their extremely uncomfortable fit (just my opinion), especially if I plan on using them for several hours straight. The size earbud I chose is close to the original SoundSports I used four years ago. After a couple of rides, I could hardly feel them. The tight fit also prevents any wiggle room or potential for falling out, so when I'm in the drops or sprinting I'm not concerned at all about these running away.<br/><br/>* They are not completely sound-proof, which is great for me when I need to listen to traffic and other people while riding. This means I can start a ride wearing these and not have to take them off other than to talk to people and to take breaks.<br/><br/>* The automation is really useful actually. Automatically detecting when the right earbud has left my ear to pause music, then detecting when I put it back on to resume music is probably my favorite of this aspect. Answering calls by putting on the earbud is okay too, but in reality by the time you open the case and put on the earbud (plus the time it takes to connect to your device) your incoming call has probably already ended. But, going back to the first bit of automation, there's honestly no better feeling than riding up to a friend, taking out the right earbud, and stopping your music with little to no effort. I'm sure other earbuds do this too, but I'm new to the true wireless scene.<br/><br/>* The touch controls make riding without pulling out your phone an easy feat. The option to skip tracks with a double-tap on the left bud, play/pause with a double tap on the right bud, and now a swipe up or down to adjust the volume all help me keep my attention on the road.<br/><br/>* The call quality is amazing, according to everyone I call while wearing these. I speak softly and mumble sometimes out of habit, but these earbuds adjust and pick up even the softest of rumblings I might mutter. They also amplify my voice enough to be heard by everyone involved in a call, thus improving my ability to articulate points beyond belief. These earbuds have made it into my daily carry because of this.<br/><br/>* So far, these have been completely impervious to sweat. I'm almost afraid that I'm going to break them in time because since buying them two months ago I have not had a need to clean them in any way (besides the actual rubber earbuds).  Hopefully, these will continue to resist all the sweat I throw at them (which is a lot considering that I wear jawbreaker glasses and have helmet straps pooling sweat around my ear).<br/><br/>* The battery life is strong and perfect for my use. Since my typical training ride lasts anywhere from 1:45 to 2 hours, I never have to worry about battery life. Even during my extra long rides, I can very easily take a break from my music, let them charge for 30 or so minutes, and continue my ride without care for battery life at all.<br/><br/>In-betweeners -<br/>* The sound quality is a bit more trebly than the Shure earbuds I used. This isn't necessarily a bad thing for me. I definitely don't mind more or less bass than usual. Some people might choose against these for this reason.<br/>* Being a Bluetooth device, the connection between the earbuds and your device cannot always be perfect. I went from using wired to wireless and I had to learn this the hard way. I believe it's a fact of life for me now, but this is something that will only get better with time (I hope). Intermittently, my music will cut in and out as if I'm getting a call, then resume as normal. My phone also seems to be the culprit with a lot of other Bluetooth issues. Using IP voice comm apps like Teams or Discord will cause the microphone to produce this "shrill noise". I can work around this by using those apps on my work phone instead, so I definitely don't blame the earbuds at all for this. Otherwise, the call quality is excellent.<br/>* These are very reliant on the Bose app. Because I am just getting into the latest generation of Bose products, I was really unaware of this aspect before buying the earbuds. Not saying this would've deterred me, but it does make joining the product to other devices a little more complicated. It's definitely possible to connect these earbuds to your phone without the Bose app, but doing so makes you lose out on all of the extra functionality and the earbuds play at a much lower volume than they're capable of with the Bose app.<br/><br/>Cons-<br/>* Taking calls with these earbuds while riding a bike is not possible. The wind blasting into the microphones renders them completely useless during calls, so every call I get (depending on the urgency) will require me to pull over and take a break. This happens at speeds as low as 10-15 mph, so really these cannot function for calls whatsoever while riding a bike.<br/>* While I praised the fit initially, in the beginning, I did have issues finding the perfect size earbud for me. The type of earbud has changed from the earlier generations of Bose SoundSports to now, so I did have a hard time adapting to the different fit. My ears were a bit sore in the beginning, but, as I said before, I eventually adapted and now I can hardly tell I'm wearing them.<br/><br/>There's honestly not a whole lot more I can say about these earbuds. This is all just off the top of my head... All in all, these earbuds have out-preformed in almost every way I expected. I bought them really only to listen to music on my rides without being burdened with a wire, and now I can't imagine not using them daily for calls and such.</span>

<span>Bought these on my boyfriend's recommendation, the tips make them fit and stay very well, they don't hurt my ears like other ear buds and don't feel bulky like a lot of them.<br/>They didn't have any directions for touch controls and I can't figure out any...do they have touch control?  With other ear bud brands I can use one bud at a time and I often do to extend listening time and remain aware of my surroundings...with these if I remove the left bud the right will continue to play but if I remove the right bud the left will not continue to play which is pretty frustrating.  Also I use these to connect to my computer for gaming and to my phone for audible listening, switching between the two is quite finicky, I am used to having to turn off Bluetooth on one device to get buds to connect to something other than what they last connected to, but with these even when I last connected to the computer and I try to connect to it again they go for the phone first.  Also they take forever to connect a lot of the time and several times have failed to charge when placed back in the case and often don't seem to turn on when removed from the case and placed in my ears...I have to replace the right bud in the case and remove it sometimes several times before they will turn on and start trying to connect.<br/>Overall, I could be more impressed, especially for the price point.</span>

<span>Purchased these when I was in the market for new headphones and can't believe I didn't have them sooner. I previously had airpods before I ran over the right earbud and the left earbud eventually stopped working. The sound is immaculate and pretty comfortable. My only complaint would be the black bar that's meant to hold the bud in your ear tends to hurt after an extensive amount of time (5+ hours). Aside from that, I'm able to workout, run, even dance around and they won't budge. I've always known Bose to be a top tier sound output (along with Sony and BeatsbyDre) but they were on promo and I couldn't beat the price.<br/><br/>Love music? Get these. Love blocked out noise? Get these. Don't mind a little discomfort with phenomenal sound? Get THESE.</span>

<span>These have some incredible battery life. Also the sound is excellent. Sometimes i do wish the sound would be louder to hear voices on movies, but it defintiely is sufficient. I like the different sizes that comes with to fit your ear properly and that the headphones magnetically snap into place in the case. Best part? They dont fall off when working out - Earbuds without fail always fall out when I'm at the gym - these don't! Some of the other reviews do have credence when they say your ear gets sore when wearing them for long periods of time. I find this to be true, but what pair of headphones does this not happen with? Honestly, these headphones are great - im very happy with my purchase.</span>

<span>I have had my Powerbeats Pro for about a week now and after a bit of a rocky start and an adjustment period, I find them to be almost perfect headphones. When I first put them on, I was wildly disappointed. They were uncomfortable and sounded tinny with no bass at all. I genuinely believed I would be returning them and getting second gen Air Pods instead. But, given how excited I was for the Powerebeats Pro to come out and the cost, I decided to put in a little effort and give them a chance. It wasn't until about 3 or 4 days in that I decided to keep them.<br/><br/>So, if  you are like me and think your new Powerbeats Pro sound like garbage when you first put them on and you wonder if all the positive reviewers are high, experiment with all the tips before dismissing the headphones as crap. In-ear buds need a good seal to sound good. I have freakishly small ears so I always start with the smallest tip available when trying out new headphones which usually works for me. Not this time. It sounded awful and I was briefly outraged that I had paid $250 for garbage. It was counter-intuitive, but I finally tried the biggest tips instead which gave me a good seal and let me wear the headphones without having to go as deep into my ears which made them more comfortable too. Once I found the right fit with a good seal, I discovered that yes, in fact, these things do actually have some nice ear-thumping bass. I think the bass is better than original Air Pods but also not overwhelming as Beats products have a reputation for being. It's satisfyingly skull shaking without being distorted and is balanced out nicely by clear highs. I'm not an audiophile by any means, but I won't listen to any old crap either. I like a little bass and good clarity and the Powerbeats Pro deliver.<br/><br/>My biggest issue with these is comfort. As I mentioned, I have freakishly small ears and while I have been using Air Pods for a couple years, I was doing so with discomfort. I put up with a little paind because of the convenience of function. I love the automatic connection, the ability to use one bud at a time and charging on the go in the case. So, when I first read about the Powerbeats Pro, I was expecting something that would have the convenience of Air Pods with better comfort and something that wouldn't fall out of my ears all the time. Generally, I do okay with headphones that have different sizes of silicone tips so I was expecting the Powerbeats Pro to be a comfort upgrade. Initially, they actually hurt my ears more than Air Pods, especially my right ear. I fully blame this on my freakishly small ears. I'm one of those people who often finds "one size fits all" to be laughably ridiculous. Again, I was determined to love these things so I tinkered a bit to find an acceptable level of discomfort. The largest tip allows me to get a good seal without having to put them in so deep, relieving some pressure and cutting down on pain. When I first tried them, I could only last about 20 minutes before the pain forced me to take them out. After adjusting to find a good angle and replacing the silicone tips with Comply Sport tips, I'm a lot more comfortable and can last 2 or 3 hours before I feel discomfort. Even then, I would call it discomfort and not outright pain. It's discomfort I can live with and not any worse than what I experience with Air Pods. Also, my discomfort is only in my right ear instead of both like I get with Air Pods. Since I go with one bud a lot of the time, I'll just use the left one. No biggie. I can't blame the manufacturer for my tiny ears which is why I'm not taking away a star.<br/><br/>On the plus side, the fit is very secure. I have worked out in them several times and they don't budge. I never could work out in Air Pods because they fell out all the time. I can also wear these while laying down which I couldn't do in Air Pods without them falling out periodically. Also, the connection is great. Original Air Pods used to randomly lose connection or not connect when they were supposed to. The chip upgrade in the Powerbeats Pro seems to have resolved this little annoyance. They connect faster and after a week, I haven't experienced a drop or glitch once.<br/><br/>The Powerbeats Pro do come with a tradeoff when it comes to the size of the case. If you are used to carrying around Air Pods in your pocket in their tiny case, forget about it with Powerbeats Pro. The case is significantly larger. It goes in a bag or purse without taking up a ton of room but it's too big to fit comfortably in a pocket. The extra battery life for Powerbeats is nice though. I frequently use one bud at a time and used to drain an Air Pod and have to switch ears regularly. I'm using the Powerbeats Pro the same way and haven't drained a bud yet. I'm okay with the bigger case since the better battery life makes me feel secure about leaving the case at home when I need to go bagless.<br/><br/>So in summary, these are the best sounding buds I have used. They are super convenient, easy to connect and won't fall out of your ears. If you have normal human sized ears, they will probably be comfortable and the battery life is great. You have to deal with a bigger case but the positive improvements over Air Pods make the size trade-off worth it. If you don't hear the bass, try different tips and twist them around a bit before you give up. Hopefully you won't have to work as hard at it as I did to find your happy place with Powerbeats Pro but the effort has been worth it. These are really great headphones and worth the price.</span>

<span>I have used these earbuds for 2 years and four months.  Granted I am a mature woman, but I am an almost daily workout fanatic.  Keeping that in mind, I have put these earbuds through a lot of sweaty indoor and outdoor workouts.  I have traveled with them.  The earbuds have sat in my hot car for hours.  My point is that after 28 months of heavy usage, Beats earbuds have retained their high sound quality.  In fact, through jogging sessions, power walking, using the Stairmaster, etc., these earbuds NEVER fall out of my ears. My only complaint is the microphone. In 28 months, these earbuds have been connected to my iPhone X, 11, and 12.  With each phone, my callers often complain that they can’t hear me well.  Despite my one complaint, I still highly recommend these Beats.  Run, don’t walk to your cart.  Go buy them.</span>

<span>I've been a music junkie for decades and have had many headphones/earbuds.<br/>I'd give these a "4 1/2 stars out of five"<br/><br/>On the good side:<br/><br/>1) I use Tidal with Boom on my iPhone and I have over 200 GB of music on my phone.  I had to tweak the sound settings on the Boom equalizer to get sound setting I want.  Out of the box, I'd say the sound quality is good but not necessarily exceptional.  But if you have an equalizer, odds are higher you'll be satisfied.<br/><br/>2) I've found that the battery life is indeed about 9 hours and the charging time is about what they advertise.<br/><br/>3)  As for the fit:  these are not going to fall out or slip (unless someone walks up to you and physically tries to pull them out).  The fit is perfect.  (See my notes further down for the "comfort")<br/><br/>4) I've rarely had problems pairing.  I've used these nearly every day for a year and a half and have rarely had pairing issues with the iPhone.  I can't speak for Android, as I don't use it.<br/><br/>OK, the "not so good" side:<br/><br/>1) The charging case does not support wireless charging.<br/><br/>2) The charging case is a tad large (in fairness, these buds are larger, hence the better battery life).  You "can" put it in your pockets (pants) but you'll notice it.<br/><br/>3) OK, on the comfort: the human ear isn't designed to have something stuck into it for hours at a time without feeling the pressure.  Yes, there are some buds that fit in a way that you won't feel the pressure, though I have to wonder what the downside is, as far as secure fit and seal.<br/><br/>Having said that, if I have these in my ears for more than 90 minutes, I sometimes need to take them out for a few minutes, just to let my ears "breathe".<br/><br/>Overall, give this 4.5 stars out of 5.  The three things I mentioned are not "deal breakers" for me, but they might be if you are looking for something that will feel comfortable for hours.  As much as I love these (and I do love them), I do need to pull them out for a few minutes.<br/><br/>Also, there is no ANC.  Yes, there's "noise reduction" but not cancellation.  I'm mainly in the suburbs and really don't have the need for ANC.  However, it's always a personal choice, and if you spend a great deal of time in a noisy city/transportation system, you might want to look at the newest Bose.<br/><br/>So - these are not perfect. but they are very good and I'm happy with them.  I love the battery life, the secure fit, and overall sound quality (after some tweaking).  I listen to tons of jazz and classical and 70's rock and am happy with these.<br/><br/>I had a few wireless buds before these, and was always wondering if "the grass is greener" with another set.  I have to be honest, after buying these,  my interest in finding better ones down the road is much lower.<br/><br/>Most reviews I've read are positive on this product.  Yes, a few negative ones, but mostly positive.  I bought these when they were a bit pricier, and even though they've dropped the price a bit, I'm not angry - I really like them a lot.</span>

<span>I originally bought these for my kids for school. A package of 5 for this price was already a huge win in my book. We had multiple earbuds on-hand that came of great use when flying on the airplane. I will say, these ear buds worked far better than the cheap ones that Delta provide to us; and they were comfortable as well as noise cancelling regarding the airplane and screaming babies. My husband and I actually told ourselves we were going to have to order a second order just to have as a great back up!</span>

<span>In the noisy city where i live, taking public transit to work often makes it hard for me to hear my music, often needing to put my music on Max volume for me to be able to hear my music the way i want, and even then i still hear the noises of the city. These do such a good job of isolating the sound of my music so that it's the only thing I hear, which is perfect for me. I don't want to hear the noises of the city, and with these on, I don't have to<br/><br/>I know there are better ANC options in the form of on-ear/over-ear headphones, but those are too big and usually make my ears feel clammy &amp; sweaty. So I went with these, since I've used Bose wired earbuds before and love Bose headphones that I STILL have (it's 5 been years, maybe more)<br/><br/>In the box<br/>It comes with 3 swappable ear tips so that you can have the best fit for your ears (the medium size comes on the earbuds by default). And charging case, which houses the earbuds themselves. As well as a USB to USB-C cable to charge the case with.<br/><br/>Let's get the bad stuff out of the way:<br/>The charging case, I saw the reviews saying the case was big, and then I saw the customer pictures and thought that it wasn't so big. I was wrong, this thing is HUGE. You can't really tell just how tall the charging case actually is. Don't expect to put this case in ANY kind of pocket, be prepared to carry the case in a bag. This wasnt a huge deal for me since I carry a bookbag everywhere I go. The case itself opens with the push of a button, not with a magnetic lid. I don't think this is a pro or con, i didn't mind it when I got used to it.<br/><br/>Lack of touch control features, with the touch controls you can swap between three levels of ANC (0%, 50%, and 100% by default, but you can change thee presets on their app), skip to the next track, raise the volume, pause/play music and answer/end calls. You can also bring up your phone's voice assistant (for me it was the Google assistant). This is it... You CANNOT go to a previous track to repeat it, or turn the volume down. I do wish I had the ability to change what the touch controls do, since personally, I do not use the Google assistant feature or swap noise cancellation levels at all. Which would have freed up those gestures for volume down and previous track. On top of the fact that this next feature makes the swappable ANC levels obsolete<br/><br/>Other:<br/>When you take one earbud off, it pauses your media (assuming you have music playing) and turns off active noise cancellation, which is nice when you are trying to have a conversation.<br/><br/>Putting on the headphones so that they 'seal' against your inner ears is actually very easy. Their app shows you how to properly put on the headphones, for a perfect seal every time (i know it seems trivial, you should just put them in your ear right? Nah there's a technique to it lol)<br/><br/>The battery life is nothing to write home about, but i didn't feel like they died too quickly. I only needed then to commute to and from work, and during my lunch break, which is only 3 hours a day, and i charge them every night. They don't have the best battery life but they don't die on me every hour either. At the end of an hour ii am usually at around 80% battery on each earbud. I also place them in their charging case between use and that is enough to get me through the day.<br/><br/>The Good:<br/>The sound quality and noise cancellation is top notch. Which is no surprise, since that is what Bose does best. I seriously cannot put into words just how amazing these sound, and how well they isolate my music from the world around me. I played around with turning the ANC on and off in the app and i was honestly shocked at how much noise was being cancelled by the earbuds. it almost seems criminal to talk so much about the few features i didn't care too much about, and talk so little about what i bought these earbuds for, which they do an amazing job at, but honestly there's not much i can say other than they are amazing in both sound and ANC.<br/><br/>TLDR; If all you care about is sound quality and  ANC, and want them in an earbud form factor, look no further. Get these.<br/><br/>If the quality of life features such as gesture controls and portability are the primary reasons you are looking wireless earbuds, i think you can find more affordable options.</span>

<span>I've only had these earbuds for 4 days, so I don't know much about battery life, but everything else about them has made me happy.<br/>I have 3 air conditioners and 2 fans running in my apartment, and the ANC cuts the noise down to a whisper allowing me to only hear the music. And the music sounds crisp and clear with good bass (for ear buds, anyway).<br/>The buds rest on the outside of your ear canals instead of jamming down inside, which makes them more comfortable for extended periods of time and the rubber fins hold them in place well. I've owned the Bose Sport earbuds for around a year, and they have the same fins. They've never once fallen out. (I've lost every other earbud that I've used at one time or another.) The QC buds feel just as secure and just as comfortable as the Sport buds.<br/>They are fairly large compared to other earbuds, but it's not noticable when I'm using them. Also, the case is pretty big, but I don't carry the case around in my pocket, so that doesn't bother me either.<br/>Call quality is pretty good. Everyone says they can hear me well.<br/>If you're trying to decide between the Sport or QC earbuds, I think the QC have only slightly better sound when listening to music, but the noise cancelling makes a big difference. You can hear everything better without the background noise, even at lower volume. The call quality, however, is significantly better with the QC.<br/>Right now, it's tempting to leave these on from the time I get home from work until I go to bed. They're very comfortable, and the noise isolation is quite peaceful. Hopefully I'll still like them this much in a month or 2.<br/><br/>Update for the QC2:<br/>I've always been a function over form kind of person, so I didn't really care what the original QC buds looked like (the extra large size that everyone complains about), and maybe I'm showing my age, and I might be the only person on the planet that says this, but I think the first generation QC buds were more comfortable. The QC2s go farther into my ear canal, and my ears get sore a lot more quickly. Yes, they do look a significantly  more stylish. I would also trade the new, smaller case for the first gen case that has a row of indicator lights that show how much charge is remaining. The new case has one solitary light that flashes different colors to tell me something 🤷🏼‍♂️ in some sort of indiscernible Morse code. The older, larger buds are also easier for me to handle. The new ones are like slippery, squirrelly jumping beans that never go where I'm trying to put them.<br/>But..... These new buds sound really good. I mean, they sound good enough that I'm not even considering returning them. The ANC is unbelievable, and the bass has even more punch than the first gen. They have a nice clean sound, like every other Bose product, and my ears are gradually tolerating them longer each time I use them. I'm keeping the first generation buds for when my ears get sore, or when the battery dies because I couldn't decipher the inscrutable case light, but I'm using the new ones most of the time.<br/>For me, the sound quality negates all other quibbles. Still 5⭐s.</span>

<span>If you're planning on moving around a lot with these ear buds, you'll have complaints on ear-fit and wind static, a problem only exacerbated by very glichy software; but in terms of SOUND and noise cancellation, there's nothing better in the ear bud world. I use these primarily while I cross train, bike around town, or commute on the metro. A commuter's best friend, an athlete's bane.<br/><br/>The bulk is kills them as hands-free devices during fast movement. They stick out the ear a LOT compared to Apple buds and their heavy to boot. This means that jumping around will dislodge them pretty quick unless you constantly adjust them in the ear (which I do, which is now my calling card at the gym - the girl who's ALWAYS fussing with her ear buds). The soft silicone bracket that hooks them in the ear are simply no match for their weight and, plus, if you're at all sweaty, the silicone gets slippery. For added tension, you can always try to up the size of the bracket, but no amount of tension is going to hold them in place when they're slippery. A light coating of felt would have alleviated some of this problem, but that wouldn't solve the problem of their overall bulk. That bulk catches wind like a cup and if you try to bike with these things, you won't hear anything but roaring wind rush pooling between your ear and the device.<br/><br/>The constant need to readjust is made further annoying by the fact that the software is extremely glichy. If you have to constantly touch them, they're going to start doing weird things, like changing the noise-cancellation mode, stopping your music/podcast/call, switching your music/podcast/call, etc. EVEN IF YOU TURN OFF TOUCH CONTROLS, there's a level of touch sensitivity and software function that is simply built in to the device. Its so sensitive that the brush of a pony tail or shirt collar or a hat will start the device doing something you didn't want it to. As I said, it doesn't matter if you turn off touch controls in the setting; the thing has a life of its own.<br/><br/>That software glichiness extends to other things like weird or inaccurate battery read-outs, the shutting off of one ear bud, and generally unfriendliness of use (from the iphone app). To change the noise cancellation mode, you have to click through three or four menus so if you have to move from a loud environment to a quiet one quickly, don't expect to be able to adjust the noise cancellation on a dime. You'll have to stop and scroll through menus galore.<br/><br/>But they are the king of SOUND - simply the best I've ever heard and that's the reason I put up with them. In sound quality, they put Apple Pro's to shame. The Apple buds sound hollow and tinny compared to the lush surround-sound of the Boses'. The noise cancellation also puts the Apple buds to shame - they simply cancel out at least double the amount of white noise as the Apple's. Metro trains and airplanes - these things cancel out so much of it out, its AMAZING. Quiet and peaceful. Simply amazing. Plus, there's not enough motion or adjusting during a day-to-day commute to become annoying, its a beautiful way to travel.<br/><br/>All in all, I find the sound quality and noise cancellation worth my constant wrestling with the fit or software, but how much patience you're willing to put into it is up to you.</span>

<span>There is an awful lot to like about the Bose QuietComfort Noise Cancelling Earbuds. I will break down the good and the bad below but, suffice to say, these are possibly the most polarizing ear buds I have ever had on. I guess that makes it the perfect set of buds for 2020. Here is the breakdown:<br/><br/>The good:<br/><br/>-Active Noise Cancellation (ANC): We can just get this out of the way. If you want best in class noise cancellation on an earbud, these are the set to get. Period. I have the class leading Sony ANC earbuds, the new Technics, the Samsung Galaxy Live, and have spent extensive time with the Airpod Pros. All have solid ANC but none can approach a good set of over ears. My over ear Sony WH-1000XM3's put them all to shame when it comes to turning off the outside world. I am not ready to say that these Bose buds can duplicate that level of ANC but it is close. When you get a good seal and have the adjustable ANC level on 10, the world is gone. I was out hanging Halloween decorations a couple weeks ago and my neighbor across the street was mowing his lawn. It looked comical. It appeared that he was mowing with the mower turned off. I couldn't hear it. Once I realized the trick the ANC was doing, I strained my ears to really focus and try to hear anything. Nothing. Finally, I plucked an earbud out and there it was, loud lawn mower. If great ANC is the mission, stop right now, and just buy these.<br/><br/>-Sound: Like all Bose products, these sound great. A few years ago, I would be raving about them. They have the classic signature Bose warm tonality, nice solid bass, a full mid section, and crisp resonating highs. However, after using products from Klipsch, Sennheiser,  B&amp;O, and my other afformentioned ANC earbuds, either my taste in sound has changed or my expectations have. I recently received a set of new wireless earbuds from Shure and they sound unbelievable. The detail and sound stage are amazing. These just don't sound as good. They are better than any of my buds from Samsung or Jabra for sure and in the same arena as the others. For this price, I guess I was hoping for more. One challenge may be that Bose doesn't give you the ability to customize your sound. You can customize your ANC experience just not your sound. It has to be the way Bose wants you to hear them. Frankly, this is a stunning omission. They have a great app. Just not sure how or why you leave that out. Maybe someday an update can remedy this. In the meantime, these buds sound great. Just know that at this price, there are earbuds that sound a bit better out there.<br/><br/>-Connection / Pairing: As you would expect, these come with the latest and greatest chip set as well as Bluetooth 5.1. To pair just download the Bose Music app and follow the directions. You will be all set in maybe ten seconds. Range is great. 30 plus feet through walls. All is exactly as you would expect from a high end set of buds.<br/><br/>-Intangibles: Bose gives you a very fancy auto pause they call auto transparency. Pluck a bud from either ear and the others ANC turns off. Pretty slick but there isn't a regular touch pad transparency mode. Weird. You get quick charging (5 minutes on nets 2 hours use) via USBC and Qi wireless charging. Good stuff.<br/><br/>The bad:<br/><br/>-Form factor: There is no other way to put this. These Bose buds are big. HUGE actually. While everyone else is going small, Bose went big. Some of this must be to accommodate the internals of the buds themselves. I am also guessing that, in order to get a good seal, like an over ear, they determined that they needed the extra size. Oddly, in spite of this size, they are quite comfortable and lightweight. So, while I am hitting Bose for an overall negative here, if you can live with the look, you will not mind how they feel. One more note here, you really need to try all three sets of wings as you need to get a good seal in order to experience their magical ANC.<br/><br/>-Battery life: Not a negative but definitely NOT a positive. Less than six hours on bud for me. That's in line with my other ANC buds but you would think Bose could squeeze a little more out of these since they are like satellites hanging out of your ears. Further, the case is large. I took a couple pictures next to my other buds for perspective. You only get two more charges there. Should be at least three. There is an external LED battery life indicator which is well done. All and all just should be better.<br/><br/>-Controls: For buds this big, Bose should let you control everything here. Instead, you have very limited pause/play, ANC controls, etc. No volume. No track control. These are big omissions. Pretty much means your phone always need to be at your side. Just not acceptable.<br/><br/>The Wrap:<br/><br/>Listen, I have been pretty hard on these. I feel like at $279, I should be. However, I will say this. After a few days, I 100% planned on returning these. Yet, here I am a couple of weeks later and they haven't left my side. I am not sending them back in spite of all of their shortcomings. They sound great but, more than anything, when you hit the ANC on these, the world around you vaporizes. These days, I can live with an awful lot of compromises in order to make that happen. Cheers to the Bose team on making a classy yet odd looking set of buds that give you world class ANC.<br/><br/>***Update*** I have lived with these now for a few weeks. The things I hit these for still bother me but my original 4 star review is being moved to a 5 star. There are a few reasons for this. First, while huge, I just love wearing these. They are super comfortable for long sessions. They don't jam into your ear canal but simply push against it. The Bose design team deserves a lot of credit here. They are just really well made. Something I didn't fully grasp when I wrote my initial review. Plus, they actually look kind of cool.  Secondly, as I said originally, the ANC really is amazing. Every day I use them I am more and more blown away. They just literally make the world disappear. Lastly, they sound great. I still long for an EQ option in the app but I don't really miss it in real world use. Here is the bottom line; I have a drawer full of high end earbuds and headphones. For the last few weeks, I grabbed my Samsung Live Buds once. Every other day I have reached for these. They are just simply the best buds I own. That doesn't mean that my prior criticisms aren't reasonable. It just means that everything these do well they do really well. They aren't inexpensive but, if you can pull it off, I highly recommend making the investment.<br/><br/>***Update 2.0***So one of my major gripes just got a little better. Bose just updated their app and it now includes a toggle to add volume controls on bud. You will find this toggle in your settings. Simply flip volume control on and you can now swipe up and down on the right bud to control volume. It is very well done. There is still some work to do on this front but we are getting there. Keep up the support Bose.<br/><br/>One more update here that I think is relevant. In the last few months, I have added both the Master and Dynamic MW08's and Bowers and Wilkins new buds to my arsenal. Both cost more. The Bose represent themselves very well in this premium group. Both the M&amp;D's and the B&amp;O's sound a bit better. The B&amp;O's are actually shockingly good in the way they sound. However, none of them hold a candle to what these can do with ANC. They are just so good at removing the world around you. Of ANC is the objective just buy these. You deserve it!</span>

<span>Although its not the fancy one with bells and whistles it serves it purpose. Its good for kids for their school and especially for those that tend to lose or break theirs often. Its comfortable to use and fits most phones and laptops. Its surely worth buying just for the price and if you want a handy second one to keep for backup</span>

<span>For those who are hesitating to buy any product with this low price and wondering if it's a disaster of quality, I want to leave my comment and I will make sure it is objective. The quality is good, by which I mean, I am able to use it on my laptop and IPad. Listening to music is good. I also tested the microphone, and the voice's clear. The only one small problem for me, so far, is that it has slight electric noise when operating my laptop like clicking and moving the mouse. I don't know how durable it is, we will see. But for this price, I've bought two pairs. Usually I replace my headphones every three yeas. :p</span>
