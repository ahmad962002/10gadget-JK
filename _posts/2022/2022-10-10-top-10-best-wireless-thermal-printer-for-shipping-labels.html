<span>So I am involved in short term medical mission trips.  We were headed to Honduras and, long story short, were unable to do our usual practice of purchasing meds in the US, packaging and labeling in the US, and then flying them into Honduras.  This year, we had to do it in Honduras.<br/><br/>Now, Honduras on the Caribbean coast in the summer is HOT.  Hot and humid.  All the time.  I barely learned how to use this before we left and had to learn on the fly the night before our first clinic.  We stayed up past midnight packaging and labeling meds and the Rollo went all night long.  Wonderful little device.<br/><br/>Next morning, off to clinic.  Printing labels on the fly via USB connection to a Mac.  Easy and Peasy.  Printed hundreds of labels every day in 90+ degrees and 100% humidity.  Only one jam the entire time and we probably printed close to 5k labels.<br/><br/>Highly recommend this device.  It's portable enough for me to carry it to a clinic in a third world country, rugged enough to work in ridiculously austere conditions, and fast enough to keep up with a busy clinic.</span>

<span>This printer prints high-quality on very thin and sticky labels that adhere to most services. However, it can be frustrating to print one label quickly. I almost always have to reset the printer once or even twice which means turning it off opening it up and waiting for it to reconnect vis wifi and having it reestablish the label size.  Once it is recalibrated it prints great.</span>

<span>I have the Dymo 4XL printer and the one thing I hate most about it is not having the ability to wirelessly print. I regretted the purchase the day that I bought it, especially how much it costed me back then.<br/><br/>Then I saw the brand Rollo and saw the great reviews it had on its other label printer. When I finally started searching for a wireless label and saw that Rollo made one, I immediately purchased it even though it was pricey. I hate cords!<br/><br/>Yes, the image is terrible when you AirPrint from your iPhone. It is completely distorted no matter how you edit the label on your iPhone. I’ll keep trying but I’ve already wasted a good amount of labels trying to get it to print decently from my iPhone. However, if you wirelessly print from your MacBook after cropping the label, it prints out beautifully. Majority of my shipping was done from my MacBook previously, so I’m still going to keep this and print using my MacBook.</span>

<span>Overall this printer is just okay. Not sure why all the praise in the reviews though. I find it a loud and noisy printer, with harsh and grinding noises. The print quality is also just so-so when printing from a mobile device.<br/><br/>My main interest in this unit was the Bluetooth printing, and the built-in power supply for a mobile 4x6 shipping label printer. The Bluetooth printing requires an app, and that app will not accept files (such as 4x6 label PDFs). The app is also very limited and basic. You cannot send files using the iOS Share menu to the app, either.<br/><br/>You can only wirelessly print a PDF from a phone/tablet by using the WiFi Direct method, which means you have to disconnect your device from the internet and connect via wifi direct to the printer. This indeed works, but it’s annoying and implemented poorly.<br/><br/>I’m much more pleased with my Dymo 4XL, but this does do the job as far as being able to print from a tablet and being somewhat portable. It’s just not implemented very well.<br/><br/>I’ll be looking for one of the many generic thermal printers that actually print a 4x6 label via Bluetooth. I regret buying this device and am surprised by all the ecstatic reviews.</span>

<span>I'm not one to get frustrated easily, but if there is a poster child for over complicating a simple machine that was working great and "upgrading" it to garbage the brother ql-1110nwb takes the gold!<br/><br/>The fact that you have to be a roll AND a spool each time you need to refill is a total punch in the gut to the consumer, and a waste of money and materials. They really need to rethink that. I broke two spools and lost two rolls trying to pop them open (yes, my fault for not realizing in the beginning they weren't the refillable spools i was used to).<br/><br/>Makes me wish I had stuck with my Dymo. Learn from me and my hours of dealing with brothers unresponsive customer service team and don't buy this product.

<span>So, I don't typically write reviews but I have to say this is worthy.  This little wireless printer punches way above its weight.  In the last three months, we've given it some fairly large jobs and it has handled each one like a champ.  Changing out labels is a snap.  To top it off, labels for this printer come in so many sizes and are extremely cost-effective on Amazon.<br/><br/>The only shortcoming (and it is not the printer) is P-Touch Editor, the software that drives this printer.  It is antiquated and non-intuitive.  It is like something from the mid-90s.  If they fix that, they would own the market.</span>

<span>This is a great printer for Windows users and with the proper knowledge for Mac users too.  As a Mac user, however, I returned for replacement a perfectly good printer because I did not know how to reset the print queue.  And when I contacted tech support they knew nothing about it and only had in hand instructions to help windows users.  This is not uncommon, and because the 4XL is used primarily by business for shipping labels, no surprise.  Businesses are overwhelmingly windows users.  But if you are a Mac user, please read the comments below and buy this printer with confidence.  There are two things you need to do when the printer refuses to print but the software thinks the printer is ready to go and the print light is lit.<br/><br/>1.  Reset the printer by unplugging the power supply and wait till the blue light goes out on the front.  Count to 15 slowly to fully drain the capacitors and then plug the power back in.  80% of the time that will take care of things.<br/><br/>2.  MAC OSX USERS....  After resetting the internal software of the printer following the above instructions, the software recognizes the printer and lights the print light, and yet pressing the print button does nothing, you need to restart ("resume") the print queue.  You do this as follows:<br/><br/>(a)  Select Printers &amp; Scanners in the System Preferences Window under the apple menu at upper left.<br/>(b) Select DYMO LabelWriter 4XL under the printers list.  If it is not there, close and restart the label software.<br/>(c) Press "Open Print Queue"<br/>(d) In the upper left hand corner of the Print Queue window press "Resume".  This will start printing the jobs in the queue.  If you dont want them printed, press Pause and use the x marks by each print job to remove any or all of the items in the print queue.  When the queue is cleared, press Resume.<br/>(e) Before leaving this window press Print on the Dymo Label software and verify that it prints.  If not, make sure Resume is lit.  If not, go back to (b) and proceed until you see Resume lit and press it.<br/><br/>It is unfortunate that the Dymo label software does not provide direct access to the Mac print queue so that you can resume from the label application, but it does not.  So Mac OSX users need to be cognizant that they need to resume the print process following the instructions above.  This is a great printer with decent software, but optimized for Windows.  And Tech Support was totally incapable of helping me when I called.  Nice people but all their knowledge is for windows user support.</span>

<span>Well, I had this for a few weeks, so I can't speak for some of the complaints, but I do use this in combination with Endicia to ship packages off and it works very well.  Before this, I had multiple Zebra 2844.<br/><br/>For those who ship a lot, the Zebra 2844 (EPL) is the standard with most 4x6 labels made for it.  It retails for $100-200 more than this machine, but is available ubiquitously used on ebay in the sub-$100 range.  Once you get them up and running, they often print without fail.<br/><br/>However, the 2844's are a complete pain in the behind to set-up.  We're talking playing with settings and inconsistent software from the manufacturer itself.  Sometimes I d/l 3-4 software packages before the 2844 even responded at all, let alone correctly.  All this wouldn't be so bad except on my Windows Desktop, if I so much as unplugged the usb cord to the computer for whatever reason (say I was moving it), and replugged it 5 minutes later in the very same USB slot, the computer wouldn't remember the printer at all, and the nightmarish set-up process would begin anew.  Not acceptable.  Maybe this was because the 2844 accepted parallel and serial port input as well, and USB was an afterthought in the design?  Whatever the reason, it's very plug-and-play unfriendly.  Also, when the computer went to sleep, the unit needed to be restarted or it would fail to respond.  The third defect was that everytime I printed out a shipping label, between 1 and 7 blank labels followed.  This wasn't always the case, but it was when I had to reinstall the driver and I could never figure it out.  I experienced these defects on both a 2004 and 2007 manufactured 2844, so I would say these aren't random issues.<br/><br/>A while back, I got a notebook that replaced my desktop, I would move around, so plugging and unplugging the USB cords became a fact of life, so enter the 4XL.  I always liked dymo's smaller models, they just worked, and this one was no different.  You first install the very friendly software (whether d/led or from CD) and then any of their printers and the computer recognizes it without hesitation.  I can plug my older Labelwriter 400 or my new 4XL or both and there will be no problems, whether the dymo label software is actively running or not (I use endicia instead).  It prints without problem.  I never had it jam.  Can't say much more about it.<br/><br/>As to any jamming, I would recommend when installing any new rolls of labels that are sealed at the end with adhesive tape, thow away the labels the tape was on so any adhesive residue never enters the mechanism.  That may be a source of the problem people are experiencing.<br/><br/>As for fading, this is a thermal printer and inherent to all thermal printers.  Think of receipts as well that fade, as many are of the same technology.  However, a nice dark print comes out of this that will last longer than those cheap receipts, so I have no fear shipping items, however long, long term labels for household items may require a second thought.  They are affected by direct sunlight the most.  Look up thermal printers in wikipedia for more info.<br/><br/>If I had a complaint, it's the cost of the rolls.  Dymo is ridiculously expensive, wanting nearly $0.16 a label.  Although 4x6 labels are an industry standard with many makers, the dymo labels are slightly different with a oblong hole between each label, perhaps telling the printer where to stop.  I'm not sure.  I still have the zebra labels, but I haven't had a chance to see if they worked in this machine.  Dymo warns you not to use any 3rd party labels, but that's because of profit motive.<br/><br/>However, I see 3rd party compatible labels for this machine at a well known site called labelvalue.  An excellent site, I got my zebra labels there for $0.051 (5.1 cents) a label.  The dymo compatible labels are much cheaper than the "real thing" at $0.086 (8.6 cents) a label.  For a small time operation, not a big difference.  Figuring that I was throwing away 1-7 labels on the zebra per print, I still come out ahead.<br/><br/>I just have a small business and ship a dozen items a day.  The dymo serves me well.  If you ship day and night, and have a desktop dedicated to shipping (where the cords will absolutely never be touched), a zebra may be better, sturdier and cheaper in the long haul.</span>

<span>The Dymo Branded 4x6 labels are very expensive but less than the competing Brother 4x6 labels for the Brother QL-1110NWB. The Dymo 5XL is a much better value, but these two printers are probably the most expensive to use because of the cost of branded labels. At least with the Brother, you can get less expensive generic labels. However, I found that the Dymo 5XL is much more intuitive to install and work with for people who are less computer savvy.<br/><br/>My only complaint about the physical printer is, unlike using narrower labels, wide 4x6 labels are more difficult to tear off from the device and sometimes lead to accidental label ripping.<br/><br/>IMO, the shipping labels are over-engineered and are too high quality. They should be made to be less expensive. It is like using a US Mil-Spec Humvee to go to the supermarket when all you need is a civilian car. After 3-21 days the label will have served its full purpose, so the extra quality is a waste and leads to them being overly expensive.</span>

<span>TL;DR (to long; didn't read)<br/>1. Networked, but not wireless.<br/>2. Dymo website doesn't list labels that work in this printer.<br/>3. Says you must use their USB cable. Is it not generic?<br/>4. Giant, power-hungry power supply<br/>5. Software must be downloaded. Not listed on website as described in printed instructions.<br/>6. Not prompted to register as printed instructions described.<br/>7. Manual not available through Help menu as printed instructions described.<br/>8. Seems to be finicky about network cables.<br/>9. Address book no longer available in software.<br/>10. "Recents" list no longer available in software.<br/>11. Feature to import addresses from Google didn't work.<br/>12. In Windows taskbar, tab is labeled as "Untitled".<br/>13. Super-bright, obnoxious light on front that never goes off.<br/>14. Seems like Dymo isn't putting much work into their newer models.<br/>15. And they've decide to orphan their older models<br/><br/>[UPDATE]<br/>In addition to all the things I mentioned below, another feature missing from the new software is the "Recents" list from the old version.  The Recents list showed a number of your recently printed labels, which could be recalled with a click if you needed to reprint or modify them.  It stayed there even if you stopped and restarted the software.  Very handy, now gone.<br/><br/>In the Windows taskbar, the tab for the Dymo Connect software is labelled (!) as "Untitled".<br/><br/>It really looks like the developers saw that their older "Dymo Label Software" wouldn't work with Windows 10 (it didn't) and threw something together so they would have software to drive their newer printers. But they left out anything difficult to save time and never went back to add what was missing, like the title on the taskbar And they haven't bothered to do a decent update to their website.  Too make matters worse, they're going to orphan a lot of perfectly good printers because they're two lazy to add the drivers into the new software. All in all, this doesn't really bode well for the future of Dymo.<br/><br/>----<br/>I decided to give my workhorse Dymo 330 Turbo to my mother and get myself a new one.  A network connected Dymo 550 seemed like the right choice.  I got it last month, but I'm just now getting ready for a trip to mom's, and so just setting up the new 550.<br/><br/>First disappointment: In an age when the lights over my desk and all through the house, and the soap dispenser by my sink, are all wireless, it just didn't occur to me that a network printer would require an actual wired connection to the network.  If your router is downstairs and your office is up (say, spare bedroom), and your house isn't wired with network cables and you use wireless throughout, like so many, you're going to be doing a lot of running up and down stairs to get labels.  Really guys.  I mean, my outdoor thermometer is wireless and it cost something like $15.99, not $143.<br/><br/>I went to the Dymo website to look for labels, and all the labels that I looked at say they are for the Laserwriter 440 and such, but they don't say that they're for the 550. I'm pretty sure that the others will work, but it you're going to sell a new product, take a few minutes to update the supply listings on your website to match.<br/><br/>And while we're talking about this being a new product, pretty much the top of their line, the USB cable that comes with it is USB-A to USB-B, not USB-C to USB-C. And the manual says, "Use only<br/>a DYMO USB cable with part number 1997364, available from Customer Support<br/>if you do not already have one."  Does that mean that it's not a standard USB cable?  Or are they blatantly trying to get people to buy their cable even though we all have a bunch of the old USB-A/USB-B cables stuffed in drawers (that came with our wireless printers)?<br/><br/>The power brick that comes with the printer is twice the size (physical size) of the 65w one that's powering my laptop. And the AC draw for the power supply is 1.5 amps max, so somewhere around 165w max.  My Epson Workforce only draws 19w when it's scanning and printing a full page. Even allowing for the little thermal printing element, it seems excessive.<br/><br/>The setup instructions say to go to the website and download the "Dymo Connect for Desktop" software. I didn't see any listing for that software on the site. I did figure out that their software was under the "Explore Resources and Guides" link, and was labeled in the 2nd subtitle as "DCD Windows." Again, really guys.  You don't pay by the letter on the internet.  Splurge a little.  Spell it out (or abbreviate it in the instructions you send with the printer). Save your poor customer a few minutes getting to bed.<br/><br/>The instructions said I'd be prompted to register after I downloaded and started the software. Didn't happen. They also said I'd find the 550 Series printer user guide under the help menu.  What was there was the 440 Series guide.  Back to the website to download the right printer manual.<br/><br/>Once installed, I then powered up the printer (as instructed).  It didn't appear when the software searched for it.  Eventually figured out that the printer didn't like the Cat 5 cable I'd used.  I used that one because I figured it was a "known good" cable, as I took it off of my Epson printer that it's been hooked to years. New cable and now the 550 appears.<br/><br/>Went looking to see how to bring over the address book I had in the Dymo software I used with the trusty Labelwriter 330.  Didn't see anything that helped, so back to the website, where I found in the FAQ that the new software can't use the Dymo address book. Bummer.<br/><br/>But they say it can import contacts from Google or Excel.  I gave it permission to access my Google contacts, which Google confirmed with an email.  But nope, no contacts imported.  I tried several times, to no avail. I'll be cutting and pasting a lot.<br/><br/>The printer has a super bright white LED on the front.  I haven't used the printer in over 2 hours and it's still on, shining out to all the ships at sea.  I guess I'm happy that it isn't in the spare bedroom.<br/><br/>And while I was on the website looking for help importing contacts, I saw a link to a compatibility chart for printers and software.  I checked it out and found that Dymo has decided that my trusty 330 does not deserve a longer life, even though it's still going strong.  It won't be supported in Windows 11.<br/><br/>Knowing that I'll have to trash a perfectly good printer, if I can't find a work-around, is probably why I'm being so picky about their setup process.  But that's also what happens when installing a printer after midnight and the greatest obstacle is the printer company itself.  Maybe I'll warm to it.  But not until after I've found a different brand of label printer to replace the 330 at my mom's house.</span>

<span>I have been using Dymo printers since the 1990s.  I have always loved them.  The printers are rock solid.  The only drawback is the new Dymo Connect software.  It is a pale comparison to the original Dymo Label software that was as rock solid as the printers.  Unfortunately, the older software cannot be used for the 550.  I am hoping the Dymo company will realize this and provide a much-needed upgrade to their software.</span>

<span>I had a 450 Dymo and loved it. Needed a new one and ordered the 550. Ordered some off brand labels and was ready to go....at least i thought. This unit will only work with Dymo brand labels. Seems to be a rfid tag deal to let it know what you put in the machine. This just stinks!</span>

<span>I make hundreds of labels per year for my business and I was very excited to upgrade my P-Touch Cube Plus to this model.  The Amazon description states that the PT-P900 is compatible with both Mac and Windows.  However, when I tried to set up the printer, I discovered that only Windows drivers are available for this model.  The PT-P900W model is mac compatible.  It seems so silly to me that this virtually identical model (only difference is now WiFi) would not be compatible with the same drivers or operating systems.  I will be returning this and ordering the PT-P900W.  If you are a mac user, beware!</span>

<span>Prior to this machine I purchased another cheaper brand in the $200 range. It was very buggy. This machine will connect nearly any way possible, even making printing from your smart phone an option. It is very versatile. Only thing that has been a minor inconvenience, very minor, is that the WiFi connection will not automatically connect after a power outage. Not a big deal, just something one needs to be aware of. I use it on wireless only so I would assume a wired connection would not be an issue.</span>

<span>This is an amazing desktop thermal printer. For iOS devices this is pretty much the best you can get. It uses non-proprietary labels and is a 300dpi printer. The only thing I found that I dislike about the printer is that it won't print wirelessly from Android devices because of a support issue. Hopefully Brother will fix this in an android app update. The QL1110NWB works with android and ios but it uses proprietary labels, this one doesnt use proprietary labels but wont work with android as of Feb 2021. Hopefully Brother will read the reviews and get some app engineers on this. Still a 5 star printer.</span>

<h2 style="text-align: center;">FAQS</h2>
<h3><h3>What is the best thermal printer for shipping?</h3></h3>
    

The best thermal printer for shipping is the Dymo Label Writer 450 Twin Turbo. It is fast, has a large memory, and prints high-quality labels.
<h3><h3>What is the best label printer for shipping labels?</h3></h3>
    

The best printer for shipping labels is a thermal printer.
<h3><h3>Can you use thermal printer for labels?</h3></h3>
    

Thermal printers are specifically designed to print on heat-sensitive materials, such as thermal paper. Labels are not typically considered a heat-sensitive media, so a thermal printer would not be the best option for printing labels.
<h3><h3>What is the difference between a label printer and a thermal printer?</h3></h3>
    

Label printers produce high-quality text and graphics, often on adhesive paper labels. Thermal printers produce images by heating coated thermochromic paper, so there is no need for any type of ink or toner cartridges.
