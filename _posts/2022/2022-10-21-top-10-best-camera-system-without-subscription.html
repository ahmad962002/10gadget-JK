<span>I'm not what you would call a "power user." I haven't used it at night yet and haven't connected it to the cloud. I just like to check in throughout the day on my cats while I'm at work, and this camera lets me do that. I do wish it had a little more range of motion, because sometimes my cats go underneath the camera or off to the side where the lens can't reach. I may have to put it higher up on a bookshelf. Other than that, I'm very happy with it.</span>

<span>This is great camera for those locations where you need active monitoring.  I carry a couple with me as I travel to use at a location doesn't need a full blown camera security system, but just a way to remotely monitor an area or employees.  For that these cameras are great.  Setup can be done in about 5 minutes, and the ability to remotely move the field of vision is a great feature on such an inexpensive web camera.  Picture quality is also great, and the night vision works well too.  I which the desktop software worked better and was easier to use, as I would rather store my video locally than in the cloud.  Overall though if you need a quick and cheap monitoring solution, this is it.</span>

<span>Was cautious about this camera because of the price, but I can tell you I was surprised as to the simple set up and the operation of this camera.  The directions are straight forward and the instalation and set up of the camera qas done in about 5 minutes.  I use it to check on my pets at home.  Experimented with the motion alert and was able to adjust the sensitivity enough that it detected my cat walking across the room.  Definitely would have no issues with detecting a child or adult moving around.  Using the on screen pan and tilt controls on my android phone works great.  Slight delay but works very well to pan across the room.  The night vision is very good.  In a completely dark room, the camera is able to show great details within the room.  Over all I am impressed with this camera and all its capabilities.  I plan on ordering two more for my house.</span>

<span class="cr-original-review-content">This camera is fantastic around the house! I own a property in Mexico, there I keep some of this cameras, I love that I can have a look of what is going on in there from my house in the US, it gives me so much peace of mind, this means you can place the camera anywhere and use it from any part in the world thru the app which is very friendly to use. Very easy to set up, just make sure the back of you QR code is white, I had a bit of trouble since I had my phone in night mode and the back of the code was black, the camera didn’t read it like that but once I figured this out everything went smoothly. I have alarms set up for movement inside the house, sometimes it gets triggered by the change in light at sunrise and sunset which I like to see and it reminds me to take a look at the house every day. For me this has been one of the best purchases I have made. Excellent image and sound quality, specially night vision, also the sound and speaker system work great! Totally recommend this camera!<br/><br/>Esta cámara es fantástica para usarla dentro de casa! Tengo una propiedad en México, ahí tengo  de estas cámaras, me encanta poder ver lo que está pasando allá, me da mucha tranquilidad, esto significa que puedes instalar la cámara en cualquier lugar y ver las imágenes desde cualquier lugar del mundo a través de la app. Muy fácil de instalar, solo recomiendo que el fondo del código QR sea blanco, yo batalle al principio porque tenía mi teléfono en modo nocturno y el fondo del código era negro, la cámara no lo leía, pero cuando me di cuenta de esto, la instalación fue inmediata. Puse que me enviara notificaciones cuando hubiera movimiento en la casa y a veces la alarma se activa con el cambio de la luz del amanecer y atardecer, lo cuales me gusta ver y me recuerda a echar un vistazo a la casa todos los días. Para mí ha sido una de las mejores compras que he hecho. Excelente imagen y sonido, especialmente la visión nocturna, también el sistema para oír y hablar a través de la app funciona muy bien. Totalmente recomendada esta cámara!</span><span class="cr-translated-review-content aok-hidden"></span>

<span>I have to start with the negatives first so that you understand why I only have it four stars. One would be the chime. I would have liked to assign a custom chime for both indoor and outdoor. (I was thinking on putting on a certain part of an Elton John tune.) The second would be the battery life. I'm at having this up and running for about two weeks, and batter power is now down to 25%. To be fiar, however, this could be an issue from the hot weather that is currently gripping the entire US. My last negative... I couldn't get things completely up and running until I had a MicroSD card in place, and even though the card was newz it kept asking for a format. Oh and it isn't clear on how to access recorded history.<br/><br/>Now... The positives. It is HYPER SENSITIVE. I LIKE THAT. I have kids who trespass on my property and I have been able to tell them they can't do that according to the bylaws of the development. I had FedEx show up and I was able to tell the delivery driver to hold on a minute and run some cold water out because it was over 100 degrees outside. And I was able to see that a cat was running up on my porch at 2 am. (The night vision is excellent, even though I keep a porch light on.)<br/><br/>What sold me on this was two things. One the parent company of eufy, which is Anker. They have high quality items. The other selling point was that there is no additional fees to maintain it. There's no costly cloud storage fees, nothing. And because this house wasn't wired for a doorbell, it was imperative to have a wireless one. Now this can go with me if I move because I own it.<br/><br/>It's well worth looking into, easy to set up.... Just those small negatives that shouldn't stop anyone from buying this.</span>

<span>I’m not at all tech savvy, but a great customer service rep, Edgar, from Eufy walked me thru working the product.  He explained everything in a clear &amp; simple way that my techno phobic mind can understand.  He was extremely patient in guiding me how to work the device, i like it more and more.  I like the clarity of pictures, the motion detection is perfect, and learning how to work the device was key for me.  It has greater peripheral vision, but is limited for me becuase of the 2 pillars on the sides of my door; tho, even with the pillars blocking the periferal vision is still excellent.  Once i understood how to use it, it works like a dream.  It helps to have a good rep explain how to use it, especially for me.  Thank u, Edgar and thank u, Eufy.</span>

<span>I'm so pleased with this!  1st time ever purchasing a security system in my 50 years but my neighbors in building absolutely lead me to purchase this.<br/>I'm single female and did not want anything that required major installation and this was perfect for me!  No wiring, no nails or screws!  I paired this with the dorebellboa and it is excellent!  I'm considering buying another for my back door but I might just move.  (it's that bad).  I love that I can leave my place and still monitor my front hall if I want to right from my phone.  I don't even have to get out of bed if I hear a loud noise in front entrance of building to my doorway.  There was no peep hole so I purchased this  cause I was hearing so much noise in front hall in all strange hours of the night.  I would highly recommend this and the dorebellboa to anyone renting or doesn't want to get hung up on door installations.  I LOVE THIS SYSTEM!  But, it's my 1st security system purchase too.  I do want to give a shout out to LifeHackster Youtube channel.  I referred to his channel for the set up and he is excellent!  It just made my life so much easier!<br/>I also bought the Wyze 3 cam and love that too.  I actually just purchased an additional 2 cams just now.  I utilize my eufy along with the wyze and this has been great.  I really am enjoying both systems.  My neighbors....they aren't enjoying it as much.  The audio can pick up all kinds of comments.  The system also allows me to save and download specific footage to my phone.  It's a great system and reliable in the sense if you will need to provide proof of harassment or awful activity going on that you wouldn't be able to prove it not recorded.<br/>My only complaint is that I have 5G wifi and both systems aren't compatible so you'll just have to bump your wifi down to the 2.4 version.  I was a little surprised cause I could've sworn they were both advertised as workable with 5G but they aren't.  This was only frustration.  I thought I'd run into issue cause my private router was set to 5g so i just bumped it down in the settings and there isn't a problem.<br/>Keep in mind, if you notice one night your system doesn't record events then you might need to shutdown and reboot router and reset the security system too.  That is what I did and it works no problem after that.  I do run system all the time so I'm due to charge soon.  I installed the system on 1/21/2021 and it's now 2/6/2022 and it runs 24/7.  I don't think that is bad the fact that it needs a charge now!</span>

<span>I have this installed at the door of our vacation home and it's been a great way to keep an eye on things while when we aren't there. I can see when packages arrive and communicate with anyone who rings the bell. This camera does require a Micro SD card that needs to be purchased separately. You need the card to play back the event recordings but each recording can be deleted through the app. I can also see how much battery is left before it needs to be charged again. It does go a few months without needing to be charged and it gets triggered all day long from people walking by. I have been very happy with this purchase.</span>

<span>The price was part of our decision to buy, combined with positive reviews.  Some of the negative reviews noted it being hard to set up the system or low video quality.  I haven't seen that.<br/>Set up was a breeze using the Eufy Securiy app.  I followed the instructions, and it was easy to connect each camera, then configure most aspects of each.<br/>Mounting was straightforward.  The biggest issue was finding a good place to put the ladder to get high enough to drill holes and screw in the mounts.<br/>I think there could be some improvements.  The ability to add activity and privacy zones to each camera is great.  But they're limited to rectangular shapes, and in the case of privacy zones, two per camera.  Not terrible, but limits the usefulness.<br/>Huge plus is the ability to configure not only audio and video by camera, but also notifications.  We don't want cameras in the front of our house constantly pinging when someone walks by but do want a notification if the camera in the back sees something.</span>

<span>The reason I purchased the Eufy Security 2C - 2 Cam Kit along with an indoor Eufy cam, was to be able to monitor the entrances to my home and inside an outbuilding - our home gym - which is about 25'  from our back door. I chose this system over Amazon's Blink system because Eufy doesn't require a monthly subscription fee and the camera videos and stills are of better quality, especially in low light than Blink cams. (My best friend has a Blink system that I've viewed for comparison prior to purchasing, but you can also check that on YouTube.)<br/><br/>In order to get more 2C cameras, I actually bought two of these kits - using only the cameras from the second kit - as it was cheaper to do this versus buying more cams individually during Prime Days when I purchased this system.  Doing so also gave me a backup for the homebase too.<br/><br/>I have set up four 2C outdoor cameras: front door, backyard patio angled towards back doors, inside the garage, and outside garage towards the street.<br/><br/>➡️ UNBOXING &amp; CHARGING: Grade A<br/>The kit comes with clear directions for easily getting started. You should have the EufySecurity app installed on your phone or tablet and have signed in with your account prior to unboxing the pieces of this kit.  You will need your wifi password and be prepared to connect the homebase via ethernet to your router for the initial setup.<br/><br/>Once you have the kit unboxed follow the prompts in the app to add devices to the app.  As you do so, directions are given to pair the cameras with the homebase.  Once all the cameras and homebase are set up, you can disconnect the homebase from the ethernet cable and use it wirelessly in a centralized area of your home.  The homebase will then act as an access point for wifi, bouncing your wifi signal further and helping with the connectivity of the cameras around your home.  I placed my homebase in my living room on the top of a tall shelf.  All of the cameras on my half-acre lot work great.  I do have a strong router and 300Mbps internet, which undoubtedly helps too.<br/><br/>The cameras need to be charged before mounting. A full charge takes about 5 hours.  Once charged, the light on the front will turn off.  You will also be able to see the percentage of charge of the cameras (while charging), and a green bar, indicating the charge when fully charged.  I wish the percentage of charge left would still be shown after charging in the app, but alas, it does not.<br/><br/>Overall, this is easy to setup kit that most people will appreciate thanks to the efforts of Eufy to make it as simple as possible to get started using it.<br/><br/>➡️BUILD QUALITY: Grade A<br/>I'm kind of a tech-geek and have tested and reviewed a lot of electronics, including home security cameras.  The Eufy 2C cameras and homebase are of very good quality - they feel sturdy and performed as expected.  The system comes with a 1-year warranty and the products are automatically registered when you set up your system.  Serial numbers for the cameras can be viewed on Eufy's web portal where you can also view your video events as you would in the EufySecurity app.<br/><br/>➡️EUFYSECURITY APP:  Grade A<br/>I'm impressed with the EufySecurity app for iOS.  I have it on my iPhone 8 running iOS 14.6 and it works perfectly! No glitchiness or crashes and the features of the app are intuitive to use.  There's a lot more information about setup and use, as well as "help" resources in the app than expected.  Adding cameras with the app was a breeze, and monitoring cameras with the app is very easy.  I like that I can adjust the order of cameras, view captured clips, and turn cameras on/off easily within the app.  I also like that I can customize notifications of movement.<br/><br/>The only thing I wish the app had that it doesn't have is a percentage of battery life for each camera after it is charged and mounted.<br/><br/>NOTE:  Using the LIVE view option will rapidly drain your phone's battery.<br/><br/>➡️TIPS FOR DECIDING ON PLACEMENT<br/>I knew I wanted to cover the doors into my home and the interior of our home gym.  I also decided that inside the garage and the driveway would be good too.  Because my husband is a fall risk, I worry that he's going to fall while outside and I won't be able to easily find him to help.  There are certain areas he traffics more heavily than others, so those were the areas I decided to focus on in locating our cameras.<br/><br/>The suggestions that I've read from multiple sources on security camera placement tend to be based on common sense.<br/><br/>🎥 These are the suggestions I followed and found important.<br/><br/>1. Don't place in direct sunlight.  This also means not in direct line to bright lights, especially at night.<br/>2. Elevate the cameras to 7'-10' for optimal coverage.  This requires taking a connected camera out and using live-view in the EufySecurity app to decide where you want to place the mounts.<br/>3.  Consider weather conditions and whether you want your cameras to be visible or not.  I purchased silicon sleeves in black to add a layer of protection against weather and falls and conceal my cameras.  I purchased them from Eufy to make sure they'd fit the way I wanted them to and they are perfect.  The mount is still white but could be spray painted.<br/><br/>➡️ MOUNTING THE CAMS: Grade A<br/>I'm a fairly handy gal to have around. I've built computers, do all the yard work on my 1/2 acre, and don't mind going up on a ladder.  I"m not sure if these things helped me or not, but I easily put up all the cameras around my house after pairing them with the homebase.<br/><br/>Before you begin, make sure you know where you want to place the mounts.  I suggest testing that out first, marking where you want to place the mount, and then getting your drill.  Each base (the part that you attach with anchors and screws) is plastic and each comes with a sticky template for drilling the holes.  This was a great addition to the kit!  You also have screws for each camera, and extras should you need them. Also a thoughtful addition.  The directions tell you what size drill bit to use to pre-drill (I really, really appreciated that bit of info...)  and if you need them, directions for mounting on walls and the ceiling area in the EufySecurity app for reference.<br/><br/>Once you have mounted the base, loosely attach the rest of it and then screw on the camera and tighten things down.  The camera will be activated in the app, so if for some reason it's not working, make sure it's actually "on" in the app.<br/><br/>➡️ACTIVITY ZONES: Grade B<br/>The ability of these cameras to be set for activity zones, and to set up privacy zones to prevent recording your neighbors, is a great feature.  Unfortunately for me, I've yet to dial it in to provide me with the coverage I want.  This could be a user error, or it could be the app or camera placement.  I think having your cameras set to record straight on, versus at an angle would help.  I also think the app having a freeform tool to personalize zones would work better than the one they have, but I'll keep trying to use it, especially for my driveway to avoid catching all the street traffic.<br/><br/>➡️IMAGE CLARITY: Grade A<br/>This is the real reason to choose Eufy - they give you great photos and video footage.  The cameras are 1080P HD quality which for general home monitoring is great. I wouldn't recommend them for capturing fine details like license plates at 30', but for identifying people or animals on your porch or patio, it's great.  I was especially happy with the low-light performance of these cams.  Not too grainy and actually sharper than expected.<br/><br/>NOTE:  If you are looking for sharper images, consider a 2K or 4K camera setup.  Eufy has a 2K indoor camera that I added to this system for monitoring my home office and I love it!<br/><br/>➡️MOTION ISSUES : Grade C+<br/>You can set up your cameras to detect motion; animals, people, or all motion, or not monitor motion at all.  Depending upon your goals, the amount of traffic in the area, and how long you want the battery of your 2C cameras to last, motion activation settings will need to be tweaked.<br/><br/>The sensitivity of the motion activation is a little bit tough to dial in.  As I set up my outdoor cameras during a very hot period with lots of bugs buzzing around, if I set the motion detection to high, every flying bug that comes near the camera sets it off.  This is despite the 'people' only setting for the motion being set in the app.<br/><br/>🤨 I have also had the camera take a photo of my dog's face instead of mine when I come out my front door.  This camera is set to "people only" too at the highest setting, so unless those people are 18" high and covered in fur - that setting needs some fine tuning by Eufy!  Motion is captured 30' away on the walkway up to my front door, but the photo of the dog about 7' away on the front door mat was weird.<br/><br/>Another issue with motion sensitivity has to do with when a recording starts when motion is detected.  The photos of the person being detected are hit and miss.  Sometimes the photo thumbnail is too late - catching a photo of the person's ear and not their face.  Ideally, someone would be walking directly at the camera and the video would engage quickly.  In practice, that doesn't always happen.<br/><br/>It's a little frustrating that the motion detection delays the recording of events. If you had someone running or walking fast through your yard, this system may miss it unless the motion detections were set to "HIGH" and even then, it's hit or miss.<br/><br/>The motion activation works best when the movement is within 15' of the camera, but it will work at 30', but it takes more time to engage when the subject is further away.<br/><br/>➡️BATTERY LIFE: Grade B-<br/>I've been fortunate enough to enjoy other products by the parent company, Anker.  I've always found their products to be of good quality and I expect these Eufy 2Cs will be the same.  A 6 month estimated battery life is under perfect conditions.  I suspect that in the heavily trafficked areas of my home a 4 month estimate is more likely.<br/><br/>You can see your camera's battery percentage in the app's settings. Click on the little wheel icon to view individual camera settings. then click on Power Manager for that camera.  The percentage of battery life will be displayed and underneath it, there are detection statistics including Used Days, Total Detected Events, False Events filtered by AI, and Recorded and Saved Events.<br/><br/>After 2 days my front door was down to 98% from the 100% initial charge, making me think it might last 2 months on its current charge in this high traffic area.  The camera is set to provide optimal battery life.<br/><br/>🎯CHARGING HACK:  If you don't want to disconnect the camera, get an "S" hook and a small phone charger backup pack.  Use a large plastic clamp on the battery pack, connect the "S" to the hole in the handle of the clamp, and put the other end of the "S" over the arm of the mount.  Connect the included cord to the charging port on the bottom of the 2C camera.<br/><br/>➡️NO MONTHLY FEE: Grade A<br/>When comparing the Amazon Blink camera system to Eufy I was almost going to buy the Blink system as it was cheaper, but then I read about the monthly fees for storage and viewing recorded content.  That, combined with the poor low-light performance of the Blink cams (as viewed on my best friend's system) I went with Eufy 2C.<br/><br/>This 2C kit records to the homebase.  There's 16GB of internal storage and then it overwrites the old footage as it fills up.  You can save videos and stills within the app to your phone.<br/><br/>➡️NOTIFICATIONS: Grade B<br/>I have my cameras set to notify me via text-only when motion is detected. This can be changed within the app to no notifications - recordings will be saved to view later, or audible notifications with or without text.  The notification tells me when movement or sound is detected and by which camera.<br/><br/>There is a slight delay and depending upon what your motion settings are, the movement may have occurred up to 10 seconds prior to notification.  You must have motion detection set to "ON" for the camera to notify you. I have my indoor cameras set not to detect motion as there is a lot of traffic in each room.  I set them to monitor motion only at night via the app.<br/><br/>Being able to monitor your home when you are at work or traveling is great, and receiving these notifications is a plus, but only if the captured video movement is available.  Sometimes the delay on that functionality and notification may delay seeing what's really going on.<br/><br/>NOTE: I did receive EufySecurity app notifications on my Apple Watch with the EufySecurity app installed on my iPhone.<br/><br/>➡️LIGHT,  SOUND, COMMUNICATION &amp; SIREN:  Grade B<br/>You can monitor the sound in a room using these cameras.  You can also use the cameras as a two-way communication device, and deter animals and people with the siren and spotlight on each camera.<br/><br/>The spotlight on the cams can be set to come on automatically, but that drains the battery.  Manually engaging the spotlight is how I have set mine. Good for scaring away animals and people at night.  The spotlight is somewhat disappointing because it's not very powerful, but for short distances, it's helpful in capturing color video and stills at night.<br/><br/>The sound monitoring works well, but in some ways, too well.  The crickets are LOUD and there's often feedback in the form of a "whooshing" sound.  I'm not fond of it, but it is necessary when using the cams as two-way communicators.<br/><br/>The two-way communication with these cameras works well. The messages sent are clearly heard at up to 30' when the sound is set to its highest setting.  Communication is clear and better than expected.  A good way to communicate with family members and pets, even if you are at work or traveling.  If you can use the app, you can communicate via these cameras.<br/><br/>The siren feature is one that can annoy your neighbors.  It's loud, but not super-loud, and can be set to just go off via your homebase inside versus the cameras.  You can manually operate them too, which is how I have them set.<br/><br/>NOTE:  If you are looking for a baby or pet monitor, consider the indoor Eufy cams C22/C24 models - which monitor for crying.<br/><br/>🎯CONCLUSION: Grade A-<br/>The EufyCam 2C 2-camera kit is a winner for anyone who wants a simple to set up home or office security system with no monthly fee.  It isn't perfect, but it's very good.<br/><br/>Minor frustrations are something I can live with.  The motion detection can be set to just people, but bugs set it off if they fly close enough and appear large to the camera. The spotlight is pretty weak, but it does provide some illumination at short distances, thus providing color video and more clarity at night.<br/><br/>Considering all the features in the app, the camera clarity, and the improved low-light performance with and without the spotlight - especially over the Blink system - and no monthly fee to view and store footage, this is a great option for home monitoring at a reasonable price. Easy for homeowners to set up and use, providing an eye in the sky and peace of mind.<br/><br/>NOTE: Photos included are at 25'  (camera to the back door of patio) in the low, evening light and then with the spotlight engaged.  The front door picture is without the spotlight, but the porch light on, and then the daytime photo with no additional light source.  The picture of the top of my head is in complete darkness of my bathroom - checking lowlight clarity.<br/><br/>________________________________________</span>

<span>Originally got Blink cameras and returned those in 3 days. They were pure junk (terrible picture, worse night vision, terrible sound quality and it had this awful digital squealing over the recordings quite often. Also, only sporadic motion detection). Did a bit more research and chose this Eufy set and the 2k set. The closed system with no subscription was the original appeal but the quality of the cameras themselves is fantastic! There's obviously a few choices out there and I've edited a few of them but these by far are my favorites for picture, sound, and motion detection. There are a few caveats to them but they are minor in comparison. I'll update on the features as the need arises.<br/><br/>Pros:<br/>High quality picture<br/>Clearest Sound of any other system I've tried<br/>Excellent motion detection<br/>Night vision is the best quality I've seen thus far<br/>Human detection<br/>Range of vision<br/>Color or IR for night<br/>Spotlights brighter than expected<br/>The cameras construction is exemplary. Durable and water tight.<br/><br/>Cons:<br/>Instalation is finicky with several moving unattached parts that can be an issue. Especially if dropped and lost.<br/><br/>***my biggest con*** up to 3 Activity zones but they are only rectangles and cannot be uniquely shaped. This is a problem for those of us that do not have perfect rectangles or squares for property or are trying to avoid / capture certain angles.<br/><br/>No continued shapshot capture. This may not be an issue for everyone but it's one preferred feature I have of the Ring. The continuous capturing of a snapshot every 15 minutes or so is not an option on the eufy cameras. That feature has assisted us in capturing and timing of events in the past by capturing things that didn't trigger motion detection or more often are outside of our activity zones but still incredibly helpful.<br/><br/>Overall:<br/>Absolutely would recommended.</span>

<span>The system works perfectly, it is very easy to setup, the quality of the image is great and notification speed is just awesome no matter where you are in the world.<br/>Also you don't have to pay any monthly fees and you have multiple options to configure the alerts and monitoring.<br/>I found a couple of downsides though that are mostly software related so hopefully those will be fixed soon:<br/>1.- You cannot configure the alarm to sound on the home base and the cameras at the same time if the system is triggered by a window sensor (I would prefer this to make it way louder. This function only works if the alarm is triggered by one of the cameras, then you can have the alarm sound in all the devices.<br/>2.- The setup with Alexa is still limited and you can only voice activate the system in "Home" mode but not on "Away" or other personalized modes. This is a bit disappointing to have that limitation.</span>

<span>Camera quality is excellent. However  the speaker is garbage. You can barely  hear the sound .have to literally  put your ears close  to the unit. Needs  better speakers and more volume.  As others have indicated,  the network  connection 2.4 g wireless  is outdated.  Other systems are  offering 5Ghz connection.  I had to search online for a router specifically  for this unit. Totally unacceptable  in this day and age. There is also some delay or absence of recording of motion events. Hours later after the events I keep getting  alerts only to find out these are long gone events. For the price of the unit, it needs  a lot more improvement. I will  continue  using it for the time  until  I find something  better. Main reason  I haven't changed it for the Ring is because  of the onboard storage. I will  not be paying any monitoring fee to view my own camera footage. One last quirk is that trying to format the storage  does not work as expected.  I have to try it several  times before it actually  erase the video. I think this unit or software is defective. I won't be buying  anymore until  they fix it</span>

<span>I would have given this video doorbell 5 stars except I spent four hours connecting it to my WIFI network.  After trial and error, I found the WIFI issues (outlined below) and then connection went smoothly.<br/><br/>1) This doorbell only connects to 2.4 GHz networks.  I have a dual band, AC router that works well with other "2.4 GHz only" items in my household.  Not EUFY.  I needed to create a guest network on my router that happens to be 2.4 GHz only.  However, there was one more thing that needed to be done.<br/><br/>2) The phone that is used to setup the doorbell WIFI needs to be connected to the guest network during setup.  After the doorbell WIFI is set up, you can reconnect the phone back to the main network.  The setup procedure allows you to specify which SSID the doorbell should use but for some reason, it defaults to the same network that the phone uses and fails to connect.  This is probably a software bug.<br/><br/>After the doorbell was connected to WIFI, it worked great.  Video is sharp and the "human detection" mode works very well -- very few false alarms.  IR night mode is also very clear.  I was so impressed; I then purchased the EUFY S40 camera that works very well also.  I followed the above two procedure items outlined above to set up the S40 WIFI connection.  The S40 WIFI setup went very smoothly.<br/><br/>One other item: my existing doorbell transformer was only rated to 10 VA at 16 volts.  I needed to replace that transformer with a "beefier" 30 VA, 16-volt transformer.  The new transformer was only $20 and available at Menards or Home Depot.  Transformer replacement is an easy job.</span>

<span>Does what it’s supposed to, easy to install. Very clear videos in daylight. A little grainy with night vision until my porch motion lights come on, then it’s clear video again. Install was easy, setup was a little tricky. So, before installation you set up the camera with your phone to the WiFi, then unplug it. Just read and follow the setup instructions. After installing and wiring it. It would not power up. (By the way, since my old transformer was at least 30 years old, I installed a new one).  I checked the power and it was 17 volts. After some thought, I unscrewed it from the wall and disconnected one wire. Then plugged it back in with the setup wire which powered it up, and began the setup process again. Disconnected the setup wire and immediately connected the hard wire from the wall. It’s been a week and has been working perfectly.</span>

<span>Have been use Arlo approximate 4 years, had 2 Arlo pro 2 and 2 Arlo essential spotlight, and 1 home base. Unlike others, Arlo cameras are ez set up! All you need is Wi-Fi and a charger, of course mounting hardwares is essential.<br/>Cons, since it is wireless camera, Arlo needs very reliable Wi-Fi, if the signal is not strong enough, or internet outages they won’t work properly, not only that, you need to recharge or replace the batteries after a period of time. For Arlo essential spotlight, I think it consumes much more power when spotlight is on! I used to have a solar charging panel with it  but it is not enough, then I decide to connect it with a AC power, now I can have it on 24/7.<br/>For camera’s sensitivity it is hard too say, personally I adjusted it all the way too Max, because sometimes it doesn’t do anything even with very close range actives, since I have it powered with AC so I don’t have to worry about recharge the batteries.<br/>For night version, it is okay, nothing surprises. And if something can reflect brighter light, then you can see anything on that thing, like a cars license plate.<br/><br/>Pros, it is very easy to install! No cables! No cables! No cables! If you decided to replace the batteries once in a while, and this is the main reason I go with Arlo.<br/>When I bought Arlo pro2, I think it come with 7 days free recoding, but they seems no longer have it for newer products. You need subscribe the service to have all videos saved, I paid $10 a month which is unlimited devices, price is acceptable for me<br/><br/>I’m conclusion, nothing is perfect if you can accept the cons above you should have it, otherwise you might want to shopping around others</span>

<span>We were happy to get a bundle of 1 camera &amp; 1 doorbell, which is exactly what we need. However, when we searched “WIRELESS “ and this option came up, it’s not exactly accurate. Yes, the camera is wireless but the doorbell is WIRED. We were going to keep it since taking the old doorbell off &amp; hooking this up is pretty simple, except our doorway is recessed. After it was all connected &amp; set up, the view was like looking through a pinhole, all you can really see is the frame of the doorway since the original doorbell is on the inside of the frame, that view takes up most of the screen. The detection is great, the notifications are also great but it shouldn’t be listed as a WIRELESS BUNDLE if it’s not completely wireless.</span>

<span>The product is great but the motion detection alarm is useless. It is useless because anyone that has a pet or if there is a bug that goes across the camera will trigger the alarm. There needs to be a way to set it up to only be triggered when a human is detected. Motion detection catches most situations but not all of them. The picture quality is great and the night vision works pretty well. the camera is easy to set up and there were no problems with setting it up beside it taking a while to connect to the wifi. These cameras are overall pretty good but there are a few small features in the product that could be better.</span>

<span>I purchased two essential wired cameras to replace some aging Arlo Pros. Overall, picture quality is much better and being wired is convenient for my use cases. I will say they may be too sensitive. I have one in my daughters room as well as my garage. If my daughter moves at all while she’s asleep, it will alert — even with the sensitivity all the way down. The garage camera will alert if headlights shine through the windows. Ultimately, it’s a pretty minor thing.<br/><br/>Overall, I’d highly recommend these cameras.

<span>If your looking for easy and inexpensive as I was, Blink is the way to go. Adding a camera to the system is as easy as scanning a QR code. The video quality for the price is exceptional even at night. I like the way you can schedule the system to arm and disarm automatically at night in a very granular way on a 7 day plan.<br/><br/>It took me about 20 minutes to set up 5 cameras with the sync module and I did it all from my old iPad. Today I access my cameras from Android and iPhones as well as my iPad and my desktop PC. To make this work on a PC you need an Android emulator and there are many free ones to choose from. I use a popular program called BlueStacks. Looking at your videos on the big screen is often very handy.<br/><br/>I also linked it to my Alexa devices. A very handy feature when connecting them is that you can verbally arm and disarm the system. That feature alone makes it worth the effort of the setting it up. You can hands free arm and disarm the system as you come and go. Alexa can also announce movement on all the Alexa devices in the house. "Movement at the backdoor!" "Movement at the Driveway!"<br/><br/>TO be fair, it's not the most feature rich CCTV system, and sometimes you need those advanced features. However my entire family can use it with no trouble at all. From little kids to grandparents, everybody gets it.</span>

<span>Love these cameras!! Day time quality is excellent, night time quality is decent, nothing to write home about!<br/>Set up is super easy, the app is nice and easy to use! One thing that I don't like is the fact that you can't change the notification tone on the iPhone app. We have a Ring also that has a very distinguishable notification sound. The Blink notification sounds like all my phones notifications, so when it goes off at night to alert me I don't know if someone is sending me an email or breaking into my house! Unfortunately with iPhone you can't even make a Custom notification outside of the Blink app which is very disappointing. If Blink could update their iPhone app to all you to change notifications sounds it would make the product so much better! You can do this one the Ring app so I don't know what the issue is here with Blink. One other thing to note is that you have to pay $10 a month for the service, to me, this is a small price to pay for unlimited cloud space and protection. I was reading the reviews and many people seemed to have an issue with this, this may just be Bidens inflation though causing the extra stress of $10 a month. Anyway, 9/10 would recommend this product. If they fixed the notifications on the iPhone app then it would be a 10/10. Thanks</span>

<span>REVIEW UPDATE<br/><br/>We recently lost our internet connection due to updates our ISP had to make.  What we didn't know is that Blink cameras are solely dependent on an Internet connection (not just a wifi connection) even if you don't have a subscription or just have the trial.  None of the outdoor cameras will remain active when you lose Internet connectivity.  My wrongful assumption was that ONLY your local area network was needed since it relies on a wifi signal.  Nope.  That is wrong.  The Sync Modules will flash the green LED and no camera will work.  Great job Blink/Amazon for putting customers at risk to thieves and other criminals.<br/><br/>We have 4 of the outdoor cameras on two separate Sync2 Modules due to the distance from the main router.  We have an extender (set as a repeater) which handles the furthest cameras.  As I said I never considered these would go offline if the Internet connection went down.  I figured if my LAN went down then it would make total sense the cameras would go offline, yet I was foolish in my thinking.<br/><br/>Again this is shameful of Blink/Amazon to have this even as a feature.  I get that you need an account to pay for the service, but why in the world would these be designed to FAIL if your Internet connection goes down?<br/><br/>It is not only misleading to consumers to not EXPLICITLY state that these cameras will fail to operate without an Internet connection.<br/><br/>This IS one of the WORST investments my family ever made in a product.  Would have been better to purchase a CCTV camera system and just hardwired everything on the network.  For what we've now paid for 4 cameras + the sales tax we could have gotten a 4 camera CCTV setup instead from a local box store.<br/><br/>As I have said in my original review, the cameras do work, and will suffice.  Keep in mind that an Internet connection is REQUIRED and not just your local area network connection.  I had to lower my rating to just one star because nothing is lower than that on Amazon's site.  I'd give this camera system negative stars it it were possible just based on our experience over the past few months.<br/><br/>Also I think I was far too generous with parts of my original review, but experience will change your mind when the experience becomes bad.<br/><br/>I no will longer recommend ANY of the Blink cameras.  Until they are no longer dependent on an Internet connection and will fully function on just your local networks wifi signal.  I will be researching a true CCTV camera system to replace the Blink cameras.  If I could get a refund I'd do it in a heartbeat, but that window has closed.  The price of this education is high!<br/><br/>---------<br/>Original review<br/><br/>Recently purchased the Blink Outdoor 2 Camera system, and it's a very hit or miss system.  I have several things to say about the security cameras and the Blink app that goes with it.<br/><br/>The base:<br/><br/>The friction fit mounting bases are not easy to snap into place.  I had to use a long and think flat headed screw driver to aid in connecting it.  Also I worried about crushing the sensor on the camera because of how much force it takes and where my hands are pressing on the camera itself (holding from the edges while mounting under a roof eave is moderately annoying).  Once it is finally snapped to the base it moves freely and the camera stays in place.<br/><br/>The Sync 2 Module<br/><br/>This is the brains of the system.  Each module controls up to 10 cameras and utilizes your 2.4GHz Wifi connection.  Now I mistakenly assumed that my 2 camera system didn't include the Sync 2 Module (I didn't notices a "what's in the box" on Blinks Amazon page.  So I ended up buying one which was a waste of money considering it's included.  The setup takes a while after you power it on you'll need the app to discover the device.  Initially the blue LED flashes and the green LED is steady.  Once it is discovered then then both LEDs are steady.<br/><br/>The app (Android)<br/><br/>At first the app to control this camera system seems simple, but there are some annoyances I've discovered.  The system will NOT discover the best WiFi connection on your network.  I have an detached garage with the camera approximately 75 feet from the Sync 2 Module, and my router is close to 10 feet from the Sync 2 Module.  So I picked up a WiFi extender and set it as a Repeater (firewall, DNS, DHCP etc. is controlled by my primary router) in order for the signal strength to be at a maximum.  It is recommended that you use the existing WiFi names (SSIDs) on your network (for 2.4GHz only) and append _EXT so Blink can see it if using a Wifi extender.  Also keep your password keys for your wifi extender the exact same that are on your main wifi router.  Now in theory (and based on Blink's own guidelines) the system should pick the best Wifi signal based on your setup.  Well it doesn't, and there is NO option in the Blink app for me to place my garage camera on the extender Wifi (again it's on the same network as all my devices are) while keeping the door camera on the primary router (same network once again).  This is not about changing networks, this is about discovering the extender on my main network (which I repeat Blink claims it will chose the best signal automatically).  Yes I could add the second Sync 2 Module in the garage, but then I'd have to create a second system for the garage camera.  Not entirely what you should have to do.<br/><br/>Batteries:  These cameras require the more expensive Lithium AAs you do get the batteries with the cameras (mine were Energizer Lithium AAs.  The cameras are equipped with a USB B mini connection which you can use to connect to a powered USB source as to not run off batteries.  In my case I picked up a motion detector LED flood light that offers a USB connection (this unit https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B08F9CNPVW).  I would remove the batteries from the cameras because I do not know if connected will it try to charge the batteries (these are NON chargeable lithium batteries) or it will it bypass the batteries?  I would err on the side of caution and remove them.<br/><br/>Local Storage (USB thumb drive) vs Blink Subscriptions<br/><br/>This is an Amazon product and you'd think that the Blink camera systems would provide free service to Amazon Prime members.  Nope.  You are nickled and dimed on a per camera basis at $6 monthly, and it's $100 annually (if I read it right) for one full system).  Again why is this NOT part of Prime Membership?<br/><br/>So to avoid saving to the cloud I bought a 256GB thumb drive to insert into the Sync 2 Module.  What I have discovered is ONLY clips are saved locally.  You are NOT able to save live recordings to the local storage.  Really?  Why?  What's the point of only having the clips (maxed at 60 seconds) on a local drive?  To me this is a rip off and not mentioned anywhere in the product details.<br/><br/>Yes you do get a "free" trial which unlocks all features.  If you; however, cancel that trial early or let it expire without buying a subscription than certain features are locked.  So again you pay a lot for the camera system and you are locked out of many features IF you don't buy their subscription to the cloud.  Talk about ripping folks off.  Sure you can look at live feeds, but you can't same them locally.  You can take a snapshot from the cameras, but it will NOT take a photo every hour UNLESS you BUY a Blink subscription.  Again this all goes back to Blink subscriptions.  Tell me what's the point of local storage if all you can save are clips?<br/><br/>Loading issues with clips and thumbnails.  So I've run into issues where loading a clip from the connected USB drive fails to load 95% of the time.  Again these are short clips and should pull faster than from the Cloud.  Nope.  Thumbnails are hit or miss.  These are generated when you press the camera icon on the home screen of the app.  I call them snaps, but I've noticed if I am sitting near the Sync 2 Module it can still fail.  Full wifi bars too and it still fails.<br/><br/>Alexa:<br/><br/>It is claimed by Blink that the newest generation of their cameras will work with Alexa.  I used the app from my phone, but she can't do anything with the cameras (even when trained to use them).  In this case you may have to buy an Alexa enabled device (like Show).  You technically don't need one they are NOT required for these cameras, but the Alexa app alone on a smartphone is limited.<br/><br/>Finally the recommend having minimum Internet speeds of 2Mb up and down for these cameras, but I believe that is ONLY if you are saving and storing to the cloud along with accessing from the cloud.  Locally your access to the Blink cameras will depend on your network speeds along with wifi.  The more stuff you have connected the slower it can be.<br/><br/>Conclusion.  The Blink Camera System isn't terrible, and they are affordable.  There are quirks as I mentioned and annoyances I have dealt with.  These are not high end systems but on a tight budget you can get a good start.</span>

<span>When we first purchased cams back in 2017, we compared to Arlo and Ring before we chose Blink. Now we are up to 10 cams, covering every angle of the house. Here are my findings after using them for almost 4 years (and still buying more):<br/>PROS:<br/>&gt; #1 video quality is excellent. Day time is a bit better than night, but night vision is as good as it gets with cams.  POSITION of your cam matters a ton. I started out putting them way high up and quickly realized - if you actually want identifying features - they need to be lower. Otherwise... yeah you see someone walking past, but you cant ID anything, so what is the use.<br/>&gt; So inexpensive - so easy to integrate. Anytime we have ANYTHING we need to cover, we just order another cam and it literally takes 5 minutes to get it out of the box, batteries in, and added to existing system.. seriously - 5 minutes.<br/>&gt; The app is great. Very intuitive. Our first cams had very few "advanced features" every time i order new cams, they have improved their features. Now you are able to zoom all the way in to very small areas, to capture certain areas  and exclude others.. For example - old cams you had to block off large sections of the capture area to avoid the cams picking up movement from trees, but now you can pinpoint one little part of a branch on a tree to exclude if its triggering the cam.<br/>&gt; Motion detection is very sensitive - but they have it tweaked just about right. It never misses anything, but if you setup your exclusion zones well - you can get it almost perfect. I dont have a lot of false alarms and I'm running 10 cams. We have one setup to look at the sidewak, and after much tweaking, we can actually exclude the street... but pick up both sidewalks on both sides of the street. You can setup the app to alert you or not alert you.. you can turn sound on or off on alerts. On windy days I do end up just going into the app and turning off all cams that are setup around lots of trees until the storm is over.. but thats like a few times a year.<br/>&gt; Super easy playback and control of cams. It's instant - you can control them in any way, very easily. If I am working on a project in the yard, I dont want my cams on for hours, running out of batteries - so I just go into the app and turn them all off. It takes seconds. Likewise - if i hear a noise at night, super easy to open the app and live view any cam so i can look all around the house and see everything happening outside, from every angle.<br/>&gt; Extremely easy to move around. We have had them for years - so we move them around occasionally. I even had mice in our crawlspace under the house at one point and just grabbed one of the cams off the side of the house and stuck it down there so I could catch them at night. Theres no commitment with these - no hard wiring so you can mount them anywhere and taking them on and off the mount takes 2 seconds.<br/>&gt; No subscription needed to store clips. thats BIG for us. We would not like blink as much if they changed that. We run a lot of cams and it just stays 100% full storage - we can still access a few weeks worth of video, it just deletes oldest. You can download/save any videos.<br/>&gt; Lots of mounting options. You have to buy them separately if you want anything special, but I have 3 different types of mounts - one for trees, one around porches that need to be secured so they cant be taken, and then the standard mounts for cams not at risk of being taken. There are camo skins as well - I have on in a tree that you pretty much cant see unless you know its there.<br/>&gt; Customer support is super decent. In the winter of 2018, one of my cams took on a green hue to the image when the temp went down to about 10 degrees outside. I emailed customer service explaining the issue and sent a screenshot and within 24 hours they asked me for the SN of the cam, and did a firmware update that fixed it. I was quite happy with that.<br/>CONS:<br/>&gt; So while the batteries are awesome because the cams are so easy to move around and deal with... i blow through batteries. Fortunately, i just get 20 packs of AA's, but with 10 cams - even though Blink ~says~ batteries can last a year? it totally depends on usage. So we get LOTS of traffic on our front cams because we live in a busy area and have people walking past all day. I change out the batteries on every one of those front cams once a month. Granted - thats many hundreds of video captures and ideally, we should connect those cams to electricity somehow - that is an option with blink, but I dont mind changing batteries. On the cams in the back yard and side paths - I really can go once or twice a year changing those, except for the ones that catch a lot of foot traffic. So the battery usage is totally dependent on traffic. Personally - the cams are a big deal to me, so i dont mind it at all. Benefits totally outweigh the downsides.<br/>&gt; The biggest difference between Blink and some other companies is that i see other people with hardwired cams that can catch EVERYTHING in a continuous fashion, for hours. like the surveillance videos you see online where the cam just happened to catch something happening down the street...Blink doesnt work that way. it only captures immediate video clips, triggered by motion activation. It does store all videos.. you can see something weird in your yard and look back through videos to find out what happened - but it isnt 24 hours of continuous video feed.<br/>&gt; You can get gaps in your videos. So it can capture 1 minute of video at a time, but then it takes a small break before it starts capturing again, so if something is happening and its videotaping an event - it will record an entire minute of excellent footage - but then it takes a 5 second break before it starts recording again. that doesnt sound like a long time, and for security it's not normally an issue.. the average bad guy is in and out quickly.. but it is annoying that it takes 5 seconds to re-trigger. So.... 2 minutes of continuous video... but in the middle of that 2 minutes.. a 5 second break.<br/>OVERALL - Super high video quality... cams you can move around super easily... a very easy app... I love blink and the upsides far outweigh any downsides. I always recommend it to people when they ask. You can cover your entire house at a super affordable price, you dont need to be rich at all.. Our 3 year old cams are still as good as our brand new ones. The peace of mind the cams bring me is priceless. I know every single thing happening everywhere, all the time outside. The affordability made it possible so that nothing can ever surprise us.</span>

<span>This is a replacement for a standard two bulb flood light on the corner of my house. The 360 degree camera, or 270 in my use case, is perfect to cover the door where packages are left and the backyard. The camera tracking works well. I currently have it set so the flood light comes on with activity so video clips are in color. I really like that I can vary the intensity of the LEDs. I use them at 50% brightness and it plenty of light. I'm liking this so much, I'm seriously considering another one on the opposite corner of the house. I'll have to wait for another prime day as this unit is expensive, but worth it.</span>

<span>We’re pretty happy with this purchase. It’s very easy to set up and comes with many features my favorite being the ability to control the color/brightness of the light. The microphone on it is surprisingly loud, so it should scare off any intruder with sound alone lol. It also automatically takes a screenshot of faces it captures, which is neat. I also love that I don’t have to enroll into any service to record. Overall, this is def worth the money.</span>

<span> On a side note, I took it off human only motion detection to get a look at other activity during the night and it recorded the other visitors.<br/><br/>02-08-2022 - Back to a 5-star as far as the equipment! Went through the ice storm and temperatures have been all over the place and still no moisture, so that's a good thing and the camera is working great.<br/><br/>*** The only issue now is access using Alexa and Google Home. I can control the lights with either one, but neither one will display the video, which they both used to be able to do. Not quite sure what's up with that, it displays fine using the eufy app, but it would be nice to be able to see the video feed on the Echo show and the G-Max.<br/><br/>02-03-2022 - We're back up to a 4-star rating, it went through a blizzard, negative temperatures and back into the 40's for the past couple of days and there hasn't been any moisture. We've got an ice storm coming tomorrow and then back below freezing for the weekend. If all goes well the rating will go back up to 5 stars because everything else works great. And just an aside on tracking, it follows me around the yard when I am out there!<br/><br/>01-25-2022 --- Went up to a 2-star rating, heard back from eufy, received a replacement camera and installed it yesterday. Temperature was in the 40's today, it will be back to single digit tomorrow and not expected to get above freezing for a week, so we shall see, fingers crossed! After I took the old camera down, I added another photo of the camera just to show that the moisture had returned.<br/><br/>01-06-2022 --- Went to a 1-star rating, after being back outside for 4 days, the moisture is back and covering the inside of the dome, which makes the view through the camera very blurry. Apparently, this camera can't handle cold weather. Fortunately, this camera only does the back yard. If I ever hear back from Eufy I will update my review accordingly.<br/><br/>01-02-2022 --- After 9 days in the house the moisture was finally gone. I reconnected the wiring and hooked it back up today, the temperature was in the 50's F (10's C) tomorrow we will be in the 20's F (-6's C). Only time will tell what happens next, I will let you know! I have had a TRENDnet PTZ dome camera set up outside for years and never experienced any issues like this!<br/><br/>12-28-2021 --- Went to a 2-star rating. Ended up contacting Eufy and the suggestion was to use a blow-dryer to dry up the moisture. Seemed to work at first, but when I checked on it a few hours later there was more moisture inside the dome than when I began. This didn't make any sense. Contacted Eufy about the results and NEVER heard back!<br/><br/>12-27-2021 --- Went to a 3-star rating. Noticed the video getting rather blurry/fuzzy, I figured the glass dome was probably dirty and needed to be cleaned. Went to clean the dome and found out that it wasn't dirty, it was filled with moisture! Sent an email to Eufy support and got an automated response with one of the suggestions saying to disconnect the camera and bring it inside, apparently to warm up and have the moisture go away. So I had to disconnect the hard wired camera and bring it into the house, put it on the workbench in the room where the furnace is located and that's where it's been for the past 4 days. Some of the moisture has dissipated, but there's still quite a bit there. Not sure how this is going to play out, or whether my rating goes back up or down even further. I'm not planning to have to do this on a regular basis!<br/><br/>Now... The jury came back with a 5-star review after working with eufy support, which was quick and responsive. Ended up having to uninstall and reinstall the device from the App and then do a power cycle and everything worked like a charm. Can view the camera and control the light from both Google Home and Amazon Alexa.<br/><br/>As for the motion tracking, that works like a charm also. It will lock on to you and follow you around the yard, even to the shed at the far end of the yard and then all the way back to the house right up to the point where you walk in the door. It even captures a screen shot of your face. Tried it on all motion but had to switch it back to human only when it started tracking birds! Has a lot of customizable features, for the light and for the camera. I've only just begun!<br/><br/>Before... The jury is still out on this one! Had high hopes for this camera, not even going to get in to it's functionality at this point other than my 2 main annoyances. Google home recognizes it only as a light and not as a camera. Amazon Alexa actually recognized it as a camera and a light, but now can no longer connect to it as a camera. So what's up eufy!</span>

<span>Original purchase was Nov. , 2021 . Product was shipped quickly and securely , instructions were clear and easy to understand . Installed and up and running in less than 30 mins. The app I feel is easy to use and make adjustments on the camera ( sensitivity to motion , type of motion captured , duration of recording , motion light brightness and tint etc) . The microphone is very sensitive and the speaker also works well . The only negative was that sometimes the tracking on the camera was jumpy or not follow . This was a random situation and did not follow any specific situation to happen . In January the unit suddenly stopped working and the "trouble" code light was illuminated . I ran through the troubleshooting sequence a few times with no results . I then called EUFY customer service , and get this , I actually talked to a human being . Crazy ...I know but there he was on the other end of the phone . We had a short discussion about my problem and the steps I took to try to remedy the problem . He then said he would expedite a new unit to me . I received the new unit 2 days later and returned the old unit back to them . FANTASTIC service . The new unit has been working fine with the exception of the same random motion detection problem . I will buy another one . By the way as far as EUFY products , I have owned the robot vacuum for several years and it is also a great product . Hope this helps , God Bless</span>

<span>i LOVE this product so much, if i need to get another wifi camera, it will likely be another Blink.<br/><br/>I have not been compensated in any way, for this review.<br/><br/>Does everything "as advertised".<br/><br/>First - the bad news:<br/><br/>It should be mentioned there are two parts:  the "wall-mount bracket" and the doorbell camera which attaches to the wall-mount.<br/><br/>This "mounting bracket" is horribly designed for its intended purpose (i.e. holding the doorbell camera against the door).  Once the bracket is securely mounted to your door (or wall), it's *extremely* difficult to attach the camera to it.  Even when following instructions - it required a great deal of strength to snap it in place.<br/><br/>I successfully did it two or three times, but at some point, i accidentally broke the little plastic clips that secure the camera in place.<br/><br/>Ultimately, problem solved by running a length of invisible scotch tape around the mounting bracket's edge, laying it on a flat surface (sticky side facing up), then carefully placing the camera down "onto" the bracket, and finally folding the tape UP and against the edge of the camera.<br/><br/>Once these two parts are together, then i take the assembly and "stick" to the door using adhesive strips (made by a well known stationery &amp; adhesives supply co (think "one more than '2L'."))<br/><br/>I am "NOT" mechanically inclined. If you put a wrench in my hand - i won't know which end to use to screw in the nail!  So take my word for it - using adhesive strips &amp; scotch tape - if I could get this thing to stay on the wall securely - then you can too!  As Mr Spock once said, "Primitive but effective."<br/><br/>In a couple pictures, if you look closely, you can see the tabs sticking out from beneath.<br/><br/>Also pictured (&amp; you don't need to look all that closely) is extreme closeup (camera flash ON) so the tape is easily seen.  However casual observation as you're standing at the door (even if you ring the bell), the tape is easily overlooked against the black plastic casing.<br/><br/>So while it's not ideal (indeed poorly designed), this bracket issue isn't a deal-breaker - especially for such an affordable price.<br/><br/>Now the good news!<br/><br/>OMG!  Where to begin!  BATTERY USE is nearly "non-existent"!  Put it this way:  I've had my unit working for over three months, running on the same batteries it came with.<br/><br/>I live in an indoor building, and with neighbours, deliveries, etc - fairly high traffic / motion sensor triggered video 25 times in the past 24 hrs, and 33 times the previous 24 hrs.  So that's just a little more than a 10-second video clip every hour.<br/><br/>For the past month - it's been on HIGH RESOLUTION (which uses more battery power), and longer clips both for "motion" as well as "doorbell" (this also uses more battery power).<br/><br/>So again - THREE MONTHS on the same batteries!  Amazing!  I should mention the batteries are Lithium (after tax &amp; shipping, about $ 4 a piece).  But i don't care.  It's a great system!  I love it.<br/><br/>This incredible battery-life / add to that it's "feather weight" - i don't mind using (&amp; periodically changing) the adhesive strips - what? - "every 3 or 4 Months"??<br/><br/>Blink Doorbell Camera works &amp; plays well with Alexa.  Because my office &amp; Alexa are just inside our front door (i'm sort of the gatekeeper) - i don't want people hearing they've been detected - so rather than Alexa announcing "Someone's at the door" - instead, i have my office lights flash red &amp; white.  I also have it make a quiet "ticking" sound.  On the other hand - my wife's office is far away from our front door, so in her case, Alexa simply says "Someone's at the front door".<br/><br/>Of course - the "Blink" app stamps the exact time each video clip was recorded (see image).<br/><br/> - - - - - -<br/><br/>Video Storage:  They have an affordable cloud service ($3 per month at the time of this review), but i got the sync module so i don't need to pay for the extra cloud storage.<br/><br/>If my math is right - the extra cost for the Sync Module is about $ 36 - the same price you pay for a year of storage.<br/><br/>I strongly recommend the sync module over the pay service.  Sync module works very well.<br/><br/>IMPORTANT:  BLINK DOORBELL ONLY WORKS WITH 2.4G WIFI  (i.e. it will not work on 5G).<br/><br/>I found this out the hard way, when i spent over a week, trying to figure out why i could no longer record video.<br/><br/>SIDE-NOTE:  During this "non-record week", the unit DID still chime - both when motion was detected, as well as when the doorbell was pressed.  Just no "10-second recorded video" of the chime.<br/><br/>Because of this issue - i also discovered "Blink" has a good, responsive tech support.  Just be aware you must wait at least 48 hrs for them to respond.  But they DO respond, and they're very helpful.  :-)<br/><br/>Back story:  one day, I suddenly couldn't record video, and sent them a service request.  But before they got back to me - my camera was working again, and i couldn't figure out why (i thought it "MIGHT" be the 5G, but i wasn't sure).<br/><br/>So by the time they got back to me  - i sent them an email saying Doorbell Camera was working again, i'm happy and issue Closed.  Then (still not sure how/why it fixed itself) - i described my 2.4 / 5 G switch, and asked if that could have caused the problem?  They replied "YES" and explained that 5G didn't work.<br/><br/>Again - this is "AFTER" i said it was working again (so at this point, they really didn't "NEED" to reply).  And they REPLIED anyway!  Personable and informative.<br/><br/>Not a "BIG DEAL", but if i had it to do over - i should have paid closer attention to COLOR!  My door is mostly light &amp; pastel colors (see picture).  But my doorbell is BLACK, so aesthetically - it stands out a little more than it should.  It's already sort of bulky from the get-go, so i wish i'd gotten the white one.<br/><br/>So again - overall this is an excellent system (&amp; very AFFORDABLE too).<br/><br/>Get it!  You'll be glad you did.</span>

<span> If you are like me you are a happy existing Blink Camera user who is thinking about adding the door bell to your existing setup. I had a blink camera setup aiming at my front door so at first I was not too sure that I really needed the door bell.  However for the cost I am very glad I got one.  There are a couple of things to know:<br/><br/>(1) If you are an existing Blink customer, you do not need a second sync module.  All you need is the door bell and you can simple add it to your existing account (as easy as adding an additional camera).<br/><br/>(2) If you are planning on hardwiring the blink doorbell to your existing doorbells wires. . . . you still have to use 2 AA batteries to power the camera.  This did not make sense to me as I figured my hardwires would power it, but sure enough after calling Blink support I realized I needed to put the AA batteries in the camera.  The hard wire will allow your blink doorbell to ring the doorbell in your home but will not power the camera.<br/><br/>(3) You can turn on motion detection or just have the blink door bell turn on when the door bell is rung.  This is a nice feature.  If you want to catch anyone that comes to your door (whether they ring the bell or not, you can simple turn this feature on in the app).  If you want to save battery life and are only interested in door bell ringers you can turn motion detection off.<br/><br/>(4) It has two way audio, meaning you will always hear the person at your door. . . . but you can also choose to speak to the person if you choose.  For me the audio the person at the door hears comes across a little staticky, but that could be my phone or the fact that I am using the corner mount.<br/><br/>(5) It has more of a fish bowl view so it catches a wide view (meaning it can cover most of your front porch)<br/><br/>(6) There is no additional cost to having the Blink doorbell or camera system.  Unlike other door bell systems out there, there is no additional cost to the Blink Doorbell.  The app is free, cloud storage is free, downloading images or videos is free, etc.<br/><br/>If you are looking to set it up with just batteries and no wiring to an existing doorbell system, setup is a breeze (will take two minutes).  If you are looking to hard wire it, it is still pretty easy.  I am not a handy man and what I know about electricity will shock you (get my joke) but even I was able to hard wire it.  Get the doorbell, you will be glad you did.  Hope this review helped.</span>

<span>I am a long-time user of Blink, meaning I am in the "grandfathered" set of customers with free, limited cloud storage for video.  Overall, I think if you are already a Blink customer, this is a good addition to your system.<br/><br/>Install: I needed one of those "wedges" that turns the camera to face out and using that, the install was pretty simple.  I agree with the people that noted that the back plate it comes with (which you still use when installing the wedge) is a little cheap and janky.  But the wedge is more sturdy and the resulting install is probably a little bit more solid and better than if I had just mounted the flat plate to the wall.<br/>You do need a good sized piece of flat wood to screw everything into.  This is not going to mount well to raw siding, curved trim pieces around doors etc.  You'd have to attach a small board to the surface of anything like that and then mount it to that board.<br/><br/>Power vs. batteries:  I have one of those wired doorbells that is old-school, with the metal strikers that hit little chimes, not a digital doorbell.  This apparently matters because you need more power and a slightly larger transformer to drive one of those doorbells.  In turn, that means the transformer has enough power to power the blink doorbell.  If you have a digital doorbell you may (or may not) need to rely on the battery for the cameras.  It all depends on how big the transformer for your existing, wired doorbell is.  During the setup it asks you what kind of doorbell you have, and has a fairly sophisticated set of settings to make sure that when it sends a signal to the physical doorbell it is sending the correct amount of power to strike the chimes correctly.<br/><br/>Set-up: Very easy and painless, almost exactly the same as setting up a regular blink camera.  Put in the batteries, scan the QR code, it finds the camera, links it to your existing system/sync module and you are ready to go.<br/><br/>Motion Sensor: If you are already pretty familiar with Blink cameras, you know they can come with one of two kinds of sensors to detect motion.  Camera based sensors that just detect changes in the picture and more traditional sensors that only detect actual, physical movement.  The cheaper Blink mini only has a camera based sensor, while the more expensive units only detect actual physical movement with a dedicated motion sensor.  Both kinds of sensors can be triggered falsely by something like blowing leaves, but the camera-based sensors cannot distinguish changes in shadows and light from actual movement and so they have much higher rates of false detection.  Unfortunately, the blink doorbell appears to only have the cheaper detector that can be fooled by changes in light.  It does, however, have a more sophisticated, narrower grid of zones you can exclude from movement than the older Blink mini.  How much this matters to you is going to depend on where you plan to stick the camera - if you point your doorbell camera directly at a busy road and don't lock out the parts of the image that covers the road, you will get constant alerts from every car that goes by, or every person walking on the sidewalk, etc.  So think carefully about where the camera will sit and whether you want one of those wedges to tilt the direction of the thing to keep the camera aimed only at places where you actually want it to detect motion.<br/><br/>Video quality: Very good, with a wide angle, almost fish-eye lens, so you get very good broad coverage of the area you are pointing the camera at.  There is also a microphone that records sound while you are recording video and it seems to work ok as well.  In theory you can use the thing to have a two-way conversation with whoever is at the door, but I haven't tried that yet.  I am, overall, very happy with the camera quality for the price here.<br/><br/>Sound Chime/notifications:  When you push the doorbell, a chime inside the module itself goes off.  It is reasonably loud and lets the person ringing the doorbell know they definitely rang it.  The light on the button also lights up briefly to confirm the chime was pressed.  Would you, sitting inside the house, hear the chime the doorbell makes outside?  Probably, if you are in a small, quiet house.  Would you hear it  down in the basement of a large house with the TV or music on?  Absolutely not.  So if you are not hooking this up to an existing doorbell with a properly loud internal chime, then you will want to have it hooked up to your Alexa.  I don't use Alexa so didn't test that feature.  You do get a notification on your phone, when somebody rings the bell,  but I think most people will want either a hard wired connection or an Alexa connected to this thing to make sure they always hear the doorbell.<br/><br/>What don't I like?<br/><br/>I wish it had the same motion detection sensors as the larger blink cameras.  I would have paid more to get that.  Because it uses the camera to sense motion there are places where it really won't give good results.  So think very carefully about where you will place this, how often the wind will blow trees and create moving shadows within the motion detection zone, etc.<br/><br/>It is annoying that even when the device is hard-wired, the light around the doorbell button isn't constantly lit.  Just as if it were only running on batteries, it only lights up when you press the button.  Not a huge deal in my installation, but if you don't have a porch light on, your doorbell will not be obvious to visitors.  It is particularly odd that they put a red LED into the thing which apparently has no purpose other than in the initial setup.  The design would be much better if the lighted ring around the button was always lit and then it flashed or turned red when you pressed it.  It appears all of the hardware necessary to do that is in the device, but it is not programmed that way.  I get that when the device isn't hardwired you don't want the button lit, but when it is powered it really should be lit in the dark.<br/><br/>For $50, this thing is ok.  If you get it on sale, then it is a good deal, at least if you are an existing Blink customer.<br/><br/>I am surprised that they killed off the little bit of free cloud storage for new customers.  That can't cost very much to provide these days and it was the key differentiator between Blink and some of these other companies that provide more elaborate, high-priced options.  Blink's claim to fame is that it works well enough and is cheap.  But if you have to pay a bunch of money for cloud storage no matter what, I would probably look at the more expensive options vs. Blink.  It stops being a compelling value once you start having to pay for video storage.</span>

<span>I already have several Blurams cameras, and a 5-camera plan is $99 for now, going up in price soon. I tried the Blurams doorbell camera, but it picked up too slowly and, for some reason, could not be part of the five-camera plan; it was missing much of the activity outside of my door.  This one is five times better. It works great, and I have to increase the sensitivity, so the batteries need to be changed more often. It does not come with rechargeable, so figure on buying some if you don't already have them "AA". The plan is $3 per month, and it is a little inconvenient to have two different security camera companies but not a huge deal. The blurams are far better than the PTZ cameras and outdoor camera options. this is a great doorbell camera will recommend it to my family.</span>
