<span>Wacom does it again. All of their products are excellent quality. I only wish I had bought the one with the screen rather than just a black pad.  Maybe later. Price was right.</span>

<span>I've used many Wacom products for the past 20 years<br/>from the graphite (price similar to this one) to Intuos XL and M touch (=today's Intuos pros),<br/>Cintiq 13HD, and these day I use Cintiq 24 PRO for work.<br/><br/>I am planning to travel around while working since my work is currently remote<br/>and can be done anywhere as long as I have a pc and a tablet to draw.<br/><br/>I initially thought of using my new ipad but I could not get used to the apps<br/>and the apple pen cause I was so used to the precision of a Wacom pen.<br/>Next thing was to bring a laptop + my old Intuos 5 M touch around<br/>but I realized I don't even need the M size and it won't fit my tote bag.<br/>Plus, it's pretty heavy to carry around with a laptop.<br/><br/>So, I decided to look into cheaper and smaller Wacom tablets that I can use<br/>without worrying about damaging or losing, and this one was perfect!<br/>It's also wirelessly connectable via Bluetooth which I liked.<br/><br/>PROS:<br/>1. Really small and light-weight to carry around<br/>2. Great pricing<br/>3. This is great for beginners - intermediate artists<br/>4. Wired and wireless<br/>5. Easy setup<br/>6. Precise Pen just like any other Wacom pens<br/><br/>CONS:<br/>1. The surface is a little too rough and it makes my hand clench my pen a bit harder<br/>since I need to use more force to draw something with a darker opacity compared to other pro-line-up tablets I have (cintiqs, Intuos Pros all have smoother surface that's just good enough and not too slippery like ipads)<br/><br/>2. Because the bezel around the active area is really thin (which is a pro for it's small size and lightweight), your palm might feel a bit awkward at times because there's no edge for your hand to rest on.<br/><br/>3. The build quality of the pen that comes does feel a bit cheap but it still draws without any issue and no battery's needed.<br/><br/>OVERALL:<br/>-I would recommend this to beginners who just wanted to get into digital art without overspending.<br/><br/>-I pasted on a paper-like screen protector made for a screen tablet so it's smoother than the original Intuos's rough surface. This will allow my hand to be more relaxed and the pen nib will probably last longer.<br/><br/>-For those who already own more advanced Wacom tablets, don't expect this to be on the same level of comfort as the pro lines but it's a nice tablet for traveling. I highly recommend you attach some kind of smoother texture screen protector on the tablet as I did because, without it, I find it harder to draw big curved lines (due to too much friction). My hand gets really tired quickly.<br/><br/>-Overall, I'm happy with it as it's wireless and easy to carry around. I would recommend it for any artists beginners - intermediate.</span>

<span>I am blue-collar worker going back to school and needed to take notes.<br/>My options were:<br/>1) Write in books, hard to look and search, harder to carry, gets lost, and negative to environment<br/>2) Use ipad, great quality, digital, can looked at after 2 yrs, but expensive<br/>and there I found this tablet.<br/><br/>Initially I was sceptical if I could write without a screen.<br/>It took a bit of adjustment in beginning to get used to it, but now I dont feel any difference. So overall:<br/>Pros: Easy to use, easy to carry, awesome for adults/kids<br/>Cons: Nib may need replacement but that is six months use (is that really con)<br/><br/>What I bought: Blue-tooth version that i charger overnight and use in the day<br/>Quick twist: Not all of area is usable with online graphic tools, but is a tool drawback - although it would be nice if Wacom added the software feature to map to some known writing tools like whiteboard, excalidraw etc.<br/><br/>Other than that, wish I had bought it earlier, but now with this, i am just storing digital notes.<br/>Awesome tool!!!</span>

<span>I am brand new to the drawing/sculpting scene and this was a great way to introduce myself to the basics. Very easy to set up after you make your account and verify everything. I am a big fan of the Bluetooth capabilities and the fact that I don't have to have any wires connected; I can sit back in my chair and relax while I use the tablet. I do wish there was a slot somewhere for the pen or an elastic to hold onto it but that's not enough of a deterrent to not recommend the product. Very happy with this purchase and would highly recommend to any beginners looking to get into this hobby.</span>

Use the digital pen and tablet with your computer to draw, edit photos, express ideas, write formulas and interact in online classes in a way you can’t with a keyboard and trackpad.

With Wacom’s 35+ years of digital pen development, you can count on One by Wacom as a high-quality, reliable product to last well beyond your school years. This product works with devices capable of running the latest version of Chrome OS and has been certified to meet Google's compatibility standards.

<span>I work as an engineer, and all through my career I've sketched designs. Then the pandemic happened and everyone was home.<br/><br/>Enter the Wacom tablet. This thing is amazing. I use it with Microsoft OneNote and I can sketch concepts for my customers, sketch concepts for my own study, or mark up peers' sketches. Also my stick figure game is great now.<br/><br/>If someone is right next to you then sketch on paper or on a whiteboard. If you need to share it or archive it in a database, sketch on the Wacom tablet.</span>

<span>I bought this to use with GIMP and Blender on my Linux machine and had an awesome experience with it. Wacom doesn't advertise as being penguin-friendly but the Linux kernel has the drivers for it. For both me and a friend of mine, this brand is truly plug and play (Mint and PopOS).<br/><br/>For actual use: You don't need the glove, it won't register input from your skin, you can put your hand right on it but the glove does make it feel smoother dragging your hand around which is nice. If you hover the tip over the pad it moves the cursor, touch down to click, button one is middle mouse, button two is right click. Perfect for controlling the viewport.<br/><br/>Also a super useful feature is being able to set the tablet's rotation/orientation and the ability to switch between relative and absolute cursor position. So in other words the tablet can represent the whole screen or it can work like a laptop trackpad in how it moves the cursor around.<br/><br/>If you're worried about not having shortcut buttons then remember you still have a keyboard for that so that makes this, in my opinion, the best value for a graphics tablet since it's the cheapest medium sized one I could find [for brands I know are Linux compatible].</span>

<span>Great basic tablet from Wacom, if you do not need all the bells and whistles.  I have used Wacom products for well over 15 years in the design industry.  I have gone through about 3 tablets on the higher end models over that period, but didn't really want to spend hundreds on replacing my last tablet.  I tried another brand out there and it just wasn't the same.  If you don't need the extra buttons and the wheel, this model is the best option for something simple for drawing and navigating around your screen like a mouse.  I highly recommend it if you are starting out with a tablet or just need something simple and reliable from Wacom.</span>

<span>I had gotten this tablet to draw digital art commissions with as it was recommended to me by a few close friends who also use it, however despite the fact my computer has all of the proper ports to support this tablet, it refuses to work with it as well as the tablet's drivers also refuse to install onto my computer as the "Platform is not supported" in addition to my version of Windows is also actively blocking the pen input and has no way of unblocking it, which means I need to get a new computer in order to use this tablet. I do like this tablet, and I was so excited to get started using it, but given how much this tablet costs, I was pretty upset that it didn't work with my current system, which was given to me by my father's company since I couldn't afford to get one on my own at the time my last one croaked.<br/><br/>I have been drawing digital art using only my mouse for the past 13 years and it's finally starting to hurt my wrist on top of the fact that drawing with my mouse, to get the quality I aim for, has me sitting there working for 8 and 12 hours on a single picture. I still have my olde sketch book that I draw in every now and then as well, and so I got the desire to combine the two using this tablet. My computer is a 2014 model ASUS, I am running Windows 7. However, my computer is an experimental build using a bunch of odd parts that were made to work together, so that might be why it isn't compatible with this tablet. I don't know for sure, as I am not very computer-savvy. Ironically though, this tablet does still function as a second monitor in that if I move my cursor all the way to the right, it'll appear on the tablet's screen, but my i3 CPU isn't really strong enough to support it as such, so there's another issue, however the pen input doesn't work due to the drivers refusing to install onto my system. I don't need a second monitor as desk is a big factor that I lack in, and so I had to unplug and re-box my tablet and cords until later on when I can use them. The screen quality on this tablet though, from what i've seen, was very, very impressive, so that gets 5-stars from me.<br/><br/>I do plan to keep this tablet as some of my friends and I are planning to build me a new computer running either Windows 10 or 11 sometime early next year when i'm able to afford it, but I felt that this is something that other potential artists should know, that if you're running Windows 7, there's a big possibility that this tablet won't work on it.<br/><br/>I don't really know how to rate something like this since it is a very nice tablet and I do like it, however I can't use it, so I have no idea what it's functionality is like, nor do I want to return it because i'm sure i'll be able to use it soon, so again, i'll say, if you're running Windows 7 from an older computer like how I am, there's a chance that this tablet won't work on it. ^_^;</span>

<span>Installed and loaded quickly.  The screen resolution is good.  Not quite what the higher-end Wacom tablets are, but good enough for me to be successful with fine detail and shading of some pretty involved images.  I'm more than pleased!<br/><br/>If someone you love has a passion for traditional or digital art, I highly recommend you purchase this for them.  Consider it an investment in their future.</span>

<span>To be used for photo editing on Mac Mini with Monterey 12.4. When I received this tablet, I read instructions online since there is nothing in the box but a small card with icons and arrows showing how to connect the tablet and start it.  The card gives you the impression this is a Plug And Play, mais non!  Reading from the site, you realized there is an order to follow to install the software: do not turn on or connect the tablet to your computer.  Install and then connect.  But in my case, even that did not help.  I spent a Sunday PM trying to get it to work, which entails, but is not limited to, reading a lot online, downloading and installing twice, cleaning computer in between, and playing around with computer Preferences to address issues raise by Wacom Support--reading from its Web only--or trying what other users suggested.  The additional challenge is that that recent tablet has been redesigned so it does not offer the buttons or adjustments suggested in videos or messages.  Then I gave up and spent more time cleaning up my Mac with CleanMyMac.  I am exchanging this tablet for a new one of the same model hoping it will work.  I will update this review accordingly.<br/>06-01-22 I just received the new one and it worked perfectly well.  I did not unwrapped it until I was able to test the bluetooth and it paired right away.</span>

<span>I am a long-tome Wacom user, use a tablet always, even as a mouse, and have used them all varations the last 20 years except Cintiq. This 2019/2020 Small Intuos Pro is one of the best i have ever worked on WHEN PLUGGED IN....when using Bluetooth wireless not so much.<br/><br/>PROS: Fantastic upgrade from my Wacom One (CTL-471), way more responsive and agile, movements not as chunky as Wacom One...needed a very small tablet footprint, this Intuos very similar to Wacom One specs (unlike previous Small Intuos version), and now I can rest my drawing hand on the tablet instead of the desk, very comfortable. Nice silky matte finish and enough shortcut buttons for me although i rarely use them. Have not noticed any pen nub wear issues or tablet scratching after 2 months. The stylus itself is surprisingly comfortable to hold/use over long periods of time, and power USB cord super long. Again, the size is amazing, very light, long rubber strips on back to prevent sliding, and no Bluetooth dongles. Touch features a plus but i dont use those much, leave them switched off (actual switch on side of tablet), but its there just in case. GREAT VALUE USED.<br/><br/>CONS: Bluetooth wireless is good when power near 80-90%, but once it gets to 70s it cuts out on my system (Mac Pro 6,1 using Catalina OS, tablet 2 feet away from computer) and needs a recharge to return to wireless. Also drains battery quickly when unplugged on Bluetooth, even when plugged in battery rarely gets to 100%, normally at 92%. Not sure why but very disappointing, was hoping to use wireless but very unreliable, i just have to leave it plugged in i guess. Stylus holder base is ok, shorter and heavier but I liked the old one better, takes up less space. Did not work good initially with Catalina, kept freezing out the cursor, had to restart to unfreeze, but found the fix - i describe the details at bottom of review. VERY EXPENSIVE FOR LIMITED BLUETOOTH/BATTERY LIFE.<br/><br/>OVERALL: definite must-buy if you need a super small responsive tablet with all the latest features. If you need a tablet for steady wireless workflow maybe not worth the upgrade. For $250 this tablet's wireless capabilities should be way more reliable than what it currently is. Honestly should get only 3 stars but the size and cursor response are so amazing.<br/><br/>MAC OS X BUG FIX: So, the cursor would freeze while hover-moving after a certain amount of time, which varied from a few minutes to a few days, very unpredictable. Once it froze only way to move cursor was to hold down pen nib to tablet and move around that way, but then you are click dragging or moving things everywhere, a real nightmare. Unplugging, replugging, turning touch on/off or going bluetooth never fixed it either - only fix was a reboot but then it would happen again and again. HERE IS THE FIX: go into System Preferences &gt; Security &amp; Privacy &gt; Privacy &gt; Input Monitoring &gt; UNCHECK the box next to WacomTabletDriver.app and lock/save changes. THAT FIXED THE CURSOR FREEZES! also, under Accessiblity "com.wacom.IOManager.app" box should be checked, IF not check it. ABSOLUTELY NO INFO ABOUT THIS BUG ON WACOM SITE, DAMNED SHAME, I RETURNED A PERFECTLY GOOD USED TABLET THINKING IT WAS A DUD, BUT WHEN THE NEW ONE DID THE SAME THING I KNEW IT WAS A SOFTWARE ISSUE, LUCKILY FOUND THE FIX....you're welcome Mac users!</span>

<span>I have been a Wacom customer since 1996 and always had a good experience with 6 or 7 tablets. That is util my last Wacom Intuos Pro was a terrible piece of junk for the money. I don't even want to go into it, it was junk. So I left Wacom behind and went to some of the knock offs for the last five years. A very sporadic experience at best. I finally decided to give Wacom another shot and I have to say, so far this tablet has preformed nicely like the tablets of old.</span>

<span>Recently I bought an Intuos Pro M,  after buying a cheap competitor which was worthless. .  ( I have an older Wacom tablet and wanted to upgrade ) .  I have using tablets for decades and always accepted the limitations.  But the Pro Pen 2 really blew me away.  So I decided to buy a drawing display.<br/><br/>I was looking for something in the 22 inch range..  but 1920 x 1080 seemed too much of a tradeoff..  I think we are at a point in display technology where higher resolution will become very affordable for companies to incorporate into lower end consumer products.  ( much like when flat screen technology and HD first started to become cheap )....<br/><br/>I opted for portability.  I really like the Wacom One, but I didn't want to give up the Pro Pen 2.. which is really a major decision point ( unless android is something you must have ).<br/><br/>The Cintiq 16 is perfect..  Light.  Drawing area is a standard laptop screen size... the overall dimensions put it at the size of a 17 inch laptop...  ( I stopped getting 17 inch laptops because it was not fun lugging around.. and bag selection is not great ).  For the Cintiq 16 I will suffer with the size to drag it around.<br/><br/>Setup was easy..  real easy with Windows 10..  I already had the Intuos Pro setup... so my desktop didn't need anything...  my laptop wanted a newer driver..  I don't like the cable setup.  My laptop does not have an HDMI port..  it is all USB-C...  so I had to use a USB hub that Lenovo makes... it had everything on it.. but I had an issue with it seeing the Cintiq as a generic pnp monitor.. ( which I didn't notice utnil the Wacom driver wouldn't let me change display settings. )..  Turns out the fix was easy...  I had to do a complete power down of the laptop.. so the hub would reset..  ( took me a while to find this solution.. very common with usb hubs ).  But it worked.<br/><br/>The cable though.. I wish there were an option to just get a USB-C cable.  I would even buy it as an add on...<br/><br/>The display on the Cintiq  and color is not professional grade, but it is good enough.  I have my laptop and desktop displays if I really need to tweak a drawing.  The HD on a 16 inch looks great.<br/><br/>Lag?  I use Corel Painter..  My desktop is high end.. no problem...  Laptop is not a gaming system, but it is also not a low end system.. It has an NVIDIA GPU...  So no lag either...  Could I stream videos and use Painter and not have pen lag... probably not.  ( with my Intous Pro I do get lag if I get crazy with having a youtube video up while trying to draw.. with the Cintiq I have had videos up and it didn't lag.  might be that Intuos has multi touch ).<br/><br/>one other minor thing I noticed..  The Cintiq looks better if it is an extended display and not duplicated.  not sure if it is my desktop system and drivers for my graphics cards.. maybe I need to tweak something.. but it is a cleaner and sharper screen if it is on its own and not duplicated.<br/><br/>Drawing Experience -  The pro pen 2 and this screen are incredible.  The feel is great..  I really adjusted my pressure curves.. and it is like drawing with a feather.  It was not fun and took a while in Painter, but I really played with the curves for the brushes.  Even if you just buy this and use this as a drawing tablet and use your monitor... it is worth it.  It is a much smoother experience than the intous .. and for me I get more range out of the pen sensitivity.<br/><br/>This does not have multi-touch.. which I like using for navigating the drawing and zooming...  This is where I use the Intous Pro..  it makes a nice remote with the express keys .. and the touch ring.. .  but I have my multi touch functionality with the Intous pro.  and since it is bluetooth I don't have another cord.  Not sure if someday the Wacom drivers will complain about this setup.. but for now it is nice.<br/><br/>This a solid product.  I think real professional artists might find the color range limiting, but not the drawing experience.  Part of the premium price is the pro pen 2, and it is worth it.</span>

<span>please please please make sure your laptop or pc has an HDMI port, this will not work unless you can plug in the HDMI cable along with the USB cable.  My newer laptop does not have an HDMI port and I tried using an HDMI/USB converter (this does not work).<br/><br/>i tried using it on my older laptop with the HDMI port and it works beautifully.  I am AMAZED by the pen control and sensitivity.  I tested it out on some older drawings and I'm really excited to start really digging into my art with this new tablet.<br/><br/>please note this device is basicallyyyy like a 2nd monitor you can draw on, and NOT a pc device in its own right (like an ipad or pc tablet).  That being said, once you get it plugged in right you are good to go, no color calibrations needed.  The colors are true and you can just open your art program of choice on your laptop or pc and just draw.</span>

<span>My background: I'm a traditional and digital artist and graphic designer with ten years' worth of off and on experience with traditional Wacom tablets, most recently the Intuos 3 Pro.<br/><br/>Pros: This thing works exactly the way I wanted it to. My struggle before was the hand/eye coordination involved with drawing on one thing and looking at another. The Cintiq closed that gap the way I was hoping! Once you calibrate the pen, you won't notice the parallax. There's the tiniest delay between pen input and output, but after you get used to it, it's just not an issue. The pen works great and the pressure sensitivity is exceptional — no weird glitches or blobs the way my old tablet would sometimes do. The built in stand is super sturdy and useful. And I'm finding that the 16 screen width is actually plenty of space for the kind of hobby art I want to create — and the trade off for the slimmer profile of the smaller size is actually preferable to me. It's also relatively plug and play: just download the driver from the website like the booklet says. No issues getting it all to work on a Mac, so they must have fixed that connection problem some other reviewers mentioned.<br/><br/>The cons: There's no gesture support, and it would be nice to just have pinch to zoom at my disposal, but I knew going into this what I was buying and I can live without that for the price point. I have only two real complaints. The first is that the color accuracy is actually noticable when you check against a MacBook Pro screen. I guess this can be managed by having your monitor close by, but it can be a bit of a pain to keep checking when you're doing digital paintings. But it's not the end of the world for my particular use. The second issue I have is with the cords. The power cord is three pieces long if you include the three-in-one, and it's obnoxiously inflexible. And if you want to use this with something like a MacBook Pro that only has USB-C, you may need to get a couple of adapters for the Cintiq and your external monitor in order to accommodate two HDMI cables. I was fortunate to have one on hand, as well as a USB to USB-C, or I wouldn't have even been able to test this out upon receipt of the product.<br/><br/>Bottom line: if you're a budget-conscious artist and you want to make the leap from traditional to screen tablets, you can't go wrong with this one.</span>

<span>OVERALL:<br/>I previously had a Cintiq 22HD, and for me the Cintiq 22 is a direct upgrade.  I've been satisfied with this product so far, although full disclosure: I have only had it for about a week.  I use it for medical illustrations and digital painting. In general, I think if you're a professional who uses a tablet for digital art some but NOT all of the time for work that is intended to be displayed on a customer's device, or a very serious hobbyist who does a lot of digital painting sometimes for pay and sometimes not, then you're probably the target customer for this product.<br/><br/>If you are just starting out with digital art then I think this product is probably not worth the cost for you (yet), and if you're doing artwork for print or game/movie/tv production and can get your employer to buy a cintiq for you, then you should consider getting the pro 24 or 32 instead. Personally, I would have a hard time making the business case for needing such a tablet for my current job, which is why I decided to go with one I could afford to buy as a personal expense instead.<br/><br/>WHAT THIS PRODUCT IS NOT: this tablet is NOT a computer.  It is a specialized monitor for creating digital artwork that needs to be plugged in to a computer to work.  If that's not what you are planning to use it for, then you shouldn't buy it.  Also, this product is NOT a second monitor: you should not leave it turned on when you aren't using it for artwork, if you just leave it on all the time and use it like a regular monitor it will burn out faster.<br/><br/>Pros:<br/>-If you are a wacom tablet user but have never used a pen display before then a cintiq will be a huge upgrade for you, although expect for it to take some time to get used to using it. For me the hardest thing to get used to was not being able to see the part of the screen that my hand was in front of.<br/>-If you're coming from one of the previous generation pen displays like the 22 HD, this tablet should be completely fine.  It's smaller than the 22HD, but has more screen area.  It's also lighter and doesn't get as hot, and it can sit comfortably on your desk instead of needing to hover in the air.  The stand it comes with is much sturdier and easier to deal with than the one that came with the 22HD as well.<br/>-If your computer outputs to HDMI or any lower tier signal then you probably won't have any issues with resolution.  Honestly maybe I'm just getting old but I actually had to buy a DVI adapter for the HDMI video cable to hook up to my computer.<br/>-I saw some reviews talking about paralax with this display, but I didn't notice anything serious, and definitely nothing worse than with the 22HD.<br/>-As with all wacom products it's very easy to set up as long as you are capable of downloading driver software from a website and installing it.<br/>-Finally, it is cheaper than the 22HD was 5 years ago, and a great deal cheaper than the Pro 24.<br/><br/>Cons:<br/>-If you have never used a tablet before and are coming from traditional pen and paper artwork, there is going to be a period of time where the tablet will feel awkward to use, but I promise that you will get used to it if you give it time.  There is no digital drawing tool that will be easier for you to get used to than a pen display, it is the most similar to pen and paper drawing of all digital art tools.<br/>-If you are used to working with high quality 4k video output then the 1080 screen is going to be a downgrade for you. Also just like previous generations, this cintiq has issues with color matching.<br/>-The stand is very sturdy but it does require that your cintiq sits stationary on your desk and you can't rotate it around in this position.  The way it's built also makes it more difficult to attach an ergo arm to it which was easy enough to accomplish with the 22HD.<br/>-Although it is cheaper than the Pro 24 cintiq, it's still a 1200$ piece of equipment and that is probably going to be beyond many people's budget.<br/>-And my final gripe with this tablet, which is maybe being a little nitpicky, is the location and setup of the three (!) cords that it needs in order to work.  The power cable, USB cable, and HDMI video cable all plug in to the TOP of the tablet, rather than hooking into the back or side, causing them to loop over and hang down behind the device awkwardly.  Also honestly the fact that it needs three separate cords is a lot of wires on your desk.  All of this is a fairly minor complaint though: even if one of the cords does get kinked, they aren't that expensive to replace: you don't even have to get them from wacom, it's just a standard high speed usb cable and an hdmi video cable.<br/><br/>In conclusion, if you're doing artwork for a job that involves some digital painting, or perhaps you're a freelancer who doesn't have a gigantic budget, or someone who does a lot of digital painting but isn't selling it for whatever reason, this tablet will be totally fine for your needs without destroying your budget.</span>
