<div class="slideshow-container">
<blockquote><em><div class="a-row a-spacing-small review-data"><span class="a-size-base review-text review-text-content" data-hook="review-body">
<span>I wanted to find a supplemental battery that could give about 50% more battery during the day but that didn't add too much bulk. This one does add an expected but reasonable amount of bulk to the phone but it is still slim enough and light enough to have as a daily driver. It charges the phone about 45% and will easily get me through the day with heavy navigation and screen usage. I am really happy with this buy.</span>

<span>For $25, this was a no brainer versus paying to replace my aging Note 9 battery. I can now make it through a full day and a half without worrying about plugging in my phone. Works great for days when I'm on my phone a lot for work or if I'm out all day without easy access to a power outlet. The case is easy to install and feels very sturdy once it's in place.<br/><br/>My only two gripes are that the charging button is easy to accidentally press in your pocket. I always know when it gets pressed because my phone will start heating up. Additionally, the texture on the back is a dirt magnet and is very difficult to clean. There are deep grooves going in random directions and they're deep enough to require something very small like a sewing needle to clean.<br/><br/>Other than that, I am happy with this case and plan to use it a long time.</span>

<span>I've had the phone out of the box for 2 minutes and the first thing I noticed is that there is no charging plug, which I realized is fairly common.<br/><br/>More importantly, the cable is USB C to USB C only. My Motorola phone at least came with USB-A to USB-C.<br/><br/>Luckily this phone is a gift to someone who already has a USB C charging setup, otherwise for a first-time buyer, you not only would have to buy a wall charger but a wall charger that includes USB C.<br/><br/>Not a great big deal, but something that should be communicated to potential buyers..</span>

<span>For the price, this is the best phone on the market right now. Beautiful, fast and a good battery. The speakers are awesome; loud and clear.<br/>I do not usually like Android-based operating systems, but I cannot afford what Apple wants for phones and I am not willing to buy a phone without a headphone jack (this one has one, by the way). However, OnePlus has lots of really good system features and offers a good Android experience here. I love their file manager.<br/>The camera isn't anything spectacular, but as someone who uses DSLR cameras, I don't like to use a phone for anything spectacular anyway. This camera is more than fine for day-to-day family moments and the photos certainly are not ugly.<br/>The performance is not bad, either. I play games on it and have not had any lag issues.</span>

<span>The OnePlus 2 was my first phone from their brand. I was extremely ecstatic with the direction One Plus was going in. The OnePlus 3 was my last phone, as soon as the OnePlus 3T came out they had moved in the direction of other major players in the market. They were overcharging for their devices and making incremental changes to sell a new phone.  With the release of this phone and my unhappiness with my recent Google Pixel 6 Pro, I decided to try OnePlus again. I am extremely happy with this phone. It's not like the old days when you bought a mid-range phone and you lost access to a lot of important features.  Frankly, this phone feels more responsive than my Pixel was, mostly because the 5G antenna is so much better.  I get 5G with this OnePlus phone where I wouldn't even get 4G on my Pixel.  Long story short, it's worth every penny.  Check the features before you buy it to make sure there's nothing you can't live without, but the only thing that I found most people probably won't like is the lack of wireless charging.  Other than that, I've been extremely happy.</span>

<span>For the price, this phone is a step up from my old Galaxy S8 and Xcover pro. Apps run smoothly without lag and the processor is fast to where it can do anything I throw at it. The 4500mah battery lasts me the whole day and although I'm missing the 60fps on cameras, 30fps isn't so bad either. I don't play games so I don't know for sure how it will perform with the Adreno 617 but I'm guessing it'll perform fairly well. For $300, 6GB ram, 128GB storage, and a big battery really, this makes the best bang for the buck phone. There have also been no problems that I have encountered since the purchase of this phone.<br/><br/>Update October 6th: The phone has zero issues and I have since bought another one for my father as a gift and he seems to enjoy it over the company phone he received.<br/><br/>Update November 2nd: The phone is still one of the best upgrades that I have gotten myself and my father. There is no issue with the phone and I still use it daily. One of the things that is really useful is that I don't have to worry about not having enough ram to run youtube in small-picture mode while browsing chrome, Twitter, Facebook, Amazon, or reading manga on Tachiyomi. The main complaint I had about my s8 or Xcover pro was not having enough ram to multitask while having youtube open (picture in picture mode). Now, every time I check my ram usage while using youtube and browsers, I have at least 1.8GB or 2GB of ram ready in reserve and it helps a lot.</span>

<span>I'm very very happy with this phone. I've had several Moto's. Other than the G7 Power that had a really bad antenna, I loved them all. Last year when I needed a new phone, I thought I would try out a Galaxy to see what all the hype was about. I HATED that phone. I gave it away, a practically new phone and bought this one.  I will never bother with any other brand again unless I have no choice.<br/><br/>There are a lot of great things about this phone. These are the most important ones for me personally.<br/><br/>*Fingerprint reader<br/>It always works, even if my fingers are a little damp.<br/>It's on the side of the phone instead of the screen. So no issues with scanning my print though tempered glass.<br/><br/>*Bloatware<br/>Facebook is installed when the phone is setting up, but you can delete it. You won't see it in "App Updates" in the Play Store, so it will not be reinstalled.<br/>-I also disable and remove all permissions for related FB apps in the system apps. I don't know if they have to be disabled to prevent FB from being reinstalled when you get updates.<br/>Minimal bloatware from Motorola, but they are easily disabled.<br/>Some Google apps cannot be uninstalled. They can be TRULY DISABLED. You WILL NOT see updates for them in the Play Store.<br/>There are some minor annoying apps from Moto, but they too can be disabled.<br/><br/>*Camera<br/>You might want to find a better app for editing. I'm not a professional photographer. For my needs, this is an awesome phone.<br/><br/>There are only 2 things I would change about this phone.<br/><br/>*There is no auxiliary port.<br/> I use my phone to listen to music in my car. My car has Bluetooth so I didn't think it would be a problem. The Bluetooth in my car only works for phone calls. I had to buy a Bluetooth-to-auxillary dongle. Not that big a deal, but if I knew this would be an issue, I would have bought the dongle when I bought the phone.<br/><br/>*No storage expansion port.<br/>There is more than enough storage space on this phone. Files can be moved to the cloud, etc. I like to back everything up to an SD card that I can take out of my phone. That's no longer possible, but not a deal breaker for me.<br/><br/>Even with the 2 things I don't like so much about this phone, I wouldn't trade it for something else. I'm very happy with it and will never try another brand again.</span>

<span>The fingerprint reader is located on the on-off switch it's extremely small and once you put a case around it you can't get at it. So if you're using fingerprint to log on to things it doesn't work. Other than that it's a fine phone.</span>

<span>It has no headphone jack, sd slot of dual sim. Battery life is great though the camera is good. For the brand and money, it's worth the adjustments. You can't really go wrong if the whole Bluetooth thing doesn't bother you. I would give 4/5 just because of quirks. Overall still a phenomenal phone. I now swear by moto since I got my mom one for her birthday. I've had blu's and xaiomis. This is by far competition!</span>

<span>I've had this phone for around 4 weeks and quite happy with it.  I would suggest a case for those who tend to drop your phone.  I always have because it is easier to grip, pickup, and provides a little cushion when dropping. Pictures are fine, although I would say the low light photos do suffer slightly but not a deal breaker for me.  Ran some Geekbench 5 scores and they were between 782 to734 single,  2550 to 2730 multi-core.<br/>Just changed carriers to T-Mobile and when in an urban area the 5G changes to 5G uc (Ultra Capacity) and the download was 500 to 600 mbps and upload was very good.  So far my T-Mobile experience has been excellent with this phone.  I live out in the rural areas and still get a decent signal to take care most of my common tasks on the phone.  The WIFI download was 400 to 700  mbps and upload was in a similar range depending on the traffic at the time. It is a WIFI 6 phone. WIFI test was conducted in the same room as the router.<br/>I've always been partial to the moto phones when I could get them from my carrier. Don't use a lot of the swipe options, try to keep it simple for this 82 year old mind. Love the fingerprint sensor on the power button or on the back(on an earlier Moto).  So much more accurate than  my Samsung screen sensor. Hated the Samsung because of that. If I read correctly, the "wizards of smart" are changing the new edge to a screen sensor. Should be fired immediately.<br/>The display is fine for my uses.  Watch some you tube, Netflix, news, and some local channels on my homerun HD app. Perhaps my standards aren't real high but no complaints here.<br/>Battery life is excellent.  I get easily a day and half or more with normal use.  When I ran a video test with Netflix, the battery ran down at about 10 to 12 percent an hour.  For me, that is just fine.<br/><br/>Will update later if I think of anything of value to add.</span>

<span>I've lost count of the mobile phones I've owned over the past 20 years and this model is clearly the best in every way. The price/performance ratio is unbeatable. The only weakness of this phone is the ability to use a finger print to unlock, but since the face unlock works so well the finger print issue is irrelevant for me.  Taking pictures and videos are intuitive and pretty much fool proof. Navigation is simple and easy. Speakerphone is excellent.</span>

<span>This is the best 5G phone for subpar -$500 or less budget market. The interface offers fast, buttery operations with above average somewhere north of 60 GHz exchange rate from the middling cpu, 6.4" screen and massive battery that easily lasted a day and a half of moderate use with very good multitask (apps) performance from supposedly top-notched hardwares, at least  on paper. The latest Nord iteration also ups the ante on aesthetic with a sleek, smooth composite profile especially the back cover, giving it a premium feel. 5G experience on T-MOBILE was noticably better than LTE though not a fast pronounced as than the one on Verizon. The camera takes great photos outdoors and marginal indoor shoots with poor mode or those with little light. Finally, the price is right at around $250 (I nabbed it for $199 during a short promo), making it not just the cheapest 5G set but best budget phone of the year hands down over comparable rivals that I've owned or used like Moto G power and Samsung budget A-series.</span>

<span>I love this phone!  Wanted to upgrade last year but hesitated because my old phone (Note 9) had survived being in our house when it was destroyed by fire, smoke and water.  I was emotionally attached so I truly hesitated to upgrade and then it was discontinued by T-Mobile.  Fast forward 8 months and my old phone started acting a bit wonky.  T-Mobile said I couldn't get one and frankly I didn't want to fork out over $1200 for a new phone at like Best Buy so I was sorta stuck.  Then I found this seller and this phone.  I contacted T-Mobile (who we've been with for literally 20 years) to see if I could have my handset insurance on a phone I bought even if it was renewed.  When they confirmed that yes, I could, I went ahead and bought the phone.  I'm so happy I did!<br/><br/>The phone arrived as promised, appearing brand new in the box.  No marks, no cracks, no sign of wear, nothing.  Came with the phone and a cord but beware, no charging cube is included.  Apparently that is common for new phones.  Also the wire that came with it isn't regular usb to phone usb, it's c type usb on both sides of the wire.  Sorta useless unless you have that type of cube.  I didn't so I use my regular charging wire.<br/><br/>The phone works beautifully, the camera takes absolutely awesome pictures and the price was decent.  Bought the phone in January.  It runs like a champ and you would absolutely never know it was renewed.  Overall I'm super happy with my purchase!</span>

<span>I was VERY nervous to give this a try, but when I say I am OBSESSED, I mean it. I was always an IPhone girl, and wanted to change it up. I am VERY VERY impressed and happy. I couldn't be more satisfied. It came on time, brand new, and no damage what so ever. Don't hesitate. I did, and I would've regretted it. Definitely worth it.</span>

<blockquote><em><div class="a-row a-spacing-small review-data"><span class="a-size-base review-text review-text-content" data-hook="review-body">
<span>The display is very smooth thanks to the 120Hz refresh rate, the S Pen also feels like a real pen; there's almost no delay once you start writing or drawing. The cameras are also impressive, that 50x zoom might not be used all the time, but it's great to have these features as they might come in handy in the future. As for the price, I think it's a bit overpriced, noting that it doesn't come with a wall charger, earphones, nor replacement S Pen tips which normally come in the original package.</span>

<span>So I bought this as a renewed premium and then when I did some test on it I realized that the battery capacity was under 80% and they probably said it to be over. The screen this large and for how much going on underneath there. This battery has got to be better than that because you're just charging it all day</span>

<span>Good size for anyone with small or big hands, the screen is really smooth and the apps works with no lag. I do suggest a case, since the back will attract a lot of fingerprints. Also, be sure you have your sim lock code to lock your sim card, almost got locked out of my phone.<br/><br/>Some reviews talk about the phone getting hot, it got a little warm when setting up and using the camera, but never hot for me. I can get a full day with the phone when using apps, the camera, and talk and text.<br/><br/>This I can say is the best Android phone of the year!</span>

<span>I'm glad Google was able to keep the price for the 7 at $599, it really hits that sweet spot of performance and price. Upgraded from an older Sony phone and holy cow was this a step up. Love that it gets at least 5 years of security updates, wish it was more for sustainability reasons but 5 is better than two.<br/><br/>Build quality is premium, the phone is snappy, and I've noticed an immediate improvement in my call quality (both from and to me). The camera is surpurb and allows me to take great photos of my dog without hauling my DSLR around. Does it replace a dedicated full frame or apsc camera? No. Does it take photos almost as good for social media and fits in my pocket? Heck yes it does. Well done Google, I'm very happy with this phone</span>

<span>Finally upgraded from a Pixel 3. Under-screen fingerprint reader is working much better than I expected, but still a design decision I disagree with strongly. Fingerprint (I should say thumbprint) unlocks are near instantaneous when they happen, but sometimes it does take a couple of tries. Multi-auth sessions (phone unlock + secure app unlock) do not usually take any longer than a dedicated fingerprint reader -- at least so far.<br/><br/>The actual device hardware is okay; the phone feels heavy and solid. The hard edge on the camera bump makes no sense to me, needlessly adding more areas for dust and lint to collect that feels unnatural and awkward in the hand. The official case does not solve this problem. Sound is well balanced for stereo but about what you expect without real front-facing speakers; there appears to be one speaker on the bottom-right edge of the device and another underscreen up top. Audio is too tinny to my taste for music, but I am impressed with that balance of sound from L to R between mismatched speaker types.<br/><br/>Software-wise, the Pixel-to-Pixel transfer process was terrible, relative to recent experience with Samsung-to-Samsung. Some apps came through with their settings intact while others needed to be set up again from scratch or synced manually. A few old legacy apps I relied on were suddenly no longer supported despite using the same version of Android. System settings were a mess seconded only by another maze of broken menus for the Google Assistant. Scroll momentum felt actively bad on the device, although it was improved quite a bit by installing a ready software update. I expect this to continue to improve in time, although it again begs the question: Why didn't someone try this before making a bunch of them?<br/><br/>For $600 on the 128GB model this thing is a steal though, and I feel confident recommending it easily. I think Samsung's doing a better job of maintaining consistency within their ecosystem, and Motorola is doing a better job at Android than Google, but for the hardware and camera you get here on a flagship device there is very little to complain about so long as you are comfortable waiting for Google to improve device performance and features via software updates.<br/><br/>Would I rather see another Google-made device with a flush candy bar design, stereo front-facing speakers, and a dedicated fingerprint reader like my old Pixel 3? Definitely, take my money. But until that one shows up, this one will do just fine.</span>

<span>The phone is good overall, and a great value for the price. But coming from a Galaxy, the UI has a few issues. Why am I *required* to have a Google search bar at the bottom of my home screen, and the "at a glance" tool at the top? Why can't I organize the app drawer into folders? You can use folders on the home screen, but this is not a substitute because the app drawer stays disorganized and you can't see what has or hasn't been added to a folder yet. These design choices (that could change tomorrow at no cost to Google) are small annoyances, but they are visible almost every time I use the phone.</span>
