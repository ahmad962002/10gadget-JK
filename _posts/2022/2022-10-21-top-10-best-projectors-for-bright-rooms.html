<span>Amazing picture quality and brightness for the price. My initial investigation told me that I was going to have to invest a lot more money for that level of quality, but based upon the reviews I gave this one a shot. Don’t regret it.

<span>As a vision improvement teacher who had been spending too much time at the computer (book writing projects and such), I wanted a projector to reduce my hours of LED screen time.  I chose this Optoma EH412ST because it is short throw (needed in my small office setting), and because of its high ANSI lumens and contrast ratio (which make it perfectly usable in broad daylight), plus its fan noise is negligible.<br/>Surprisingly, this unit didn't come with a connector cable, but I was able to borrow an HDMI cable from a neighbor which was all it needed.  There also was no carrier bag, nor a lens cap, which I expected to be included, but none of these small issues are deal-breakers.<br/>The important part is that the unit itself performs extremely well, even in my sun-lit office.  Its eco-setting dims the light intensity, yet even on that setting it's still very usable in daytime, which is amazing.  I use a 60" screen, and the projector sits only 2 feet away to fill the screen.  My eyes are grateful; a projector screen with its reflected light is far nicer and more natural to look at than looking directly into the light pixels of an LED screen.<br/>If you're interested in reducing computer eyestrain, this may be a solution for you too.<br/>amazon.com/Esther-Joy-van-der-Werf/e/B07P7S2K32/ref=dp_byline_cont_book_1</span>

<span>I love this projector overall for my golf simulator, however it quit working and started toggling back and forth from a blue screen to the computer screen.  Tried 2 different HDMI cables, both inputs, then tried a VGA cable, and also tried 2 different computers so 100% something wrong in the projector.  When you go to their support page there is a big message "we are having interruption to network operations" whatever that means.  Applied for an RMA as directed, should have within 72 hours, now 10 days later I called and they "didn't have proof of purchase" which they certainly DID receive, but should have told me if they didn't.  Now I have to send it again because apparently something happened at their end.  So let's see if I actually get the RMA in 72 hours.  Hope so.  The projector is awesome when it works.  Hopefully there won't be any more delays in getting it shipped to them and fixed!<br/><br/>Part 2: finally got an RMA number, they apparently have a hard time deciphering serial numbers due to the font on the sticker, but they finally figured it out but the guy didn't actually TELL me. Next guy explained it to me.  Got the RMA, sent it back and they got it 2 weeks ago, no information from them so I called today, got through to someone and first she seemed irritated that I didn't have the RMA number handy (even though I DID have the Case #, which the last guy told me was a good reference for them, but anyway she found it in the system but could not tell me what was taking so long or why I had gotten no information from them and kicked me over to "warranty" line or something.  On hold for 45 minutes, constantly saying "we value your call", but no one ever answered so I ifinally gave up.  I filed an email request with them, will see if they come through.  I mean I really WANT to give them a good review because I LIKE the projector, it just quit working and needs the warranty repair completed.  I don't even mind waiting a while if I know the status.  If they come through I will update review to reflect accordingly.<br/><br/>Part 3:  Got my projector back today and it works perfectly, so I am bumping up to 4 stars now.  Thank you Optoma tech who fixed it for me.  In the middle of golfing season I needed it and it did not take them long to get it fixed and returned.  If it was not so hard to communicate with them I would go up to 5 stars, because I do think this is an excellent projector for golf simulators.</span>

<span>The projector was AMAZING, for about 12 minutes and then it turned itself off.  After letting it cool down, and unplugging it, it worked again for another 12 minutes and then it shut down again.  I checked all the settings, and nothing should have made it do that.

<span>At first, and this is day 2 so not a long term review, I didn't like the red shift and overly colorful saturation. In the settings I changed it image to cinema and took the color down to -5. That made it very nice and seemed to be true to life in my estimation. There was no manual. I downloaded one so that was good. I'm comparing this to a WiMius p20. I got the pep for a sixed of the cost of this projector. My son bought the p20 as well. Both had different issues and this is definitely a huge step up and being laser light source hopefully it will last at least a couple million years. Yes, hyperbole. Thanks for reading.</span>

<span>This is not a regular-use projector. Better for special occasions. I would use this as often as most people would use their TV. Less than 2 years of use and there are new dead pixels every month. I’m up to 9 now. If you’re going to buy this for regular use, it would be worth an extended warranty. You will need to return it after about a year.</span>

<span>I bought this unit to replace the HD 26 that I bought in 2016. That was a very good projector I had purchased a new bulb for it and very recently the color went out on it and it was only in black-and-white. The funny thing is when I was reading the reviews for this one the remote control only had 3 1/2 stars but on the HD 26 it has five stars after unboxing I compared the two and they are the exact same. I haven’t heard mounted to the ceiling in the place of where the HD 26 was about 15 feet from the screen I am at the max and there is no adjustment for focus. Where the HD 26 had a zoom in and zoom out as well as focus and fine-tune</span>

<span> We had an Optoma HD20 for 7 years that finally stopped working. We use our theater room every night and love it so I decided to stay with Optoma since our last one worked so well. Things I love about the new one HD28HDR (1) the projector now has sound and that’s a nice addition. (2) Fan noise is almost nothing compared to our HD20 (3) Has 4K to work with our Roku Ultra (4) Picture is even better great contrast and incredible sharpness. it’s just beautiful we have a 100 inch screen and it’s just awesome!<br/><br/>Update****So I had my first problem with this unit and it's not even a year old I did get an extended warranty but my unit is still under manufactures warranty so I had to talk to Optoma on the phone my unit started for no reason going to a blank screen it would still have the sound but no picture the power button turned red and the lamp indicator was flashing red. The Tech on the phone said well that sounds like a lamp failure. ( Total Hours on lamp 300 and in eco mode) it's rated for 15,000 in eco and 4000 if not so no reason to be having a bulb failure. He said you should unseat the bulb and reseat it I said I would but I see no directions for this and the sticker on the side says it voids the warranty. He said no it doesn't and I'm sure it says how to replace the bulb so he looked it up only to see I was correct the directions say nothing about bulb replacement. Then he said well maybe the company only wants our Tech's doing it on this unit.....( I replaced my bulb on my old one 2 times super easy) So I definitely would not have purchased this if I knew I would have to mail it in or bring to them to do a simple bulb replacement. So he told me to use direction for another unit that has the same set up to open and reseat the bulb. He said don't worry it won't void the warranty if that doesn't work send it in to us.  I inspected it and it still very clean and mine hangs from a mount so it never gets moved around no signs of any dust build up which is the usually enemy of these units. So now I have to decide if I want to take it apart reseat the bulb or mail it into them. If I knew that this unit may not have been made so the owner can replace the bulb I definitely would have purchased something else and I would probably now say that to anyone looking at it for the simple fact bulbs break and blow and it always seems to happen at the worst time like the day before the Super Bowl (yes I had that happen) also why I like to keep a spare one. I would even give serious consideration to a unit that has no bulbs if your in the market they cost more but in the long run you may be happy you spent the extra money because if every time this one breaks if I have to mail it in and wait to get it back I will not be happy customer.<br/><br/>Update #2 Optoma has had this unit for 1 month I had to keep emailing them asking when will we get it back? Finally yesterday they emailed me saying it’s a bulb failure but they don’t have any bulbs right now and don’t expect any until September. So now I am looking at 2 1/2 months with no projector. I emailed them and offered to buy a better model if they would credited me for the cost of this one just let me upgrade and get my theater room back up and running and I was told no my only option is to wait on the part. DO NOT BUY! Also if shopping for a projector know this Optoma has one repair center in the USA it’s in California so to ship this to them was around $60 since I am on they east coast.<br/><br/>Update October 3,2021 So we just received our unit back today from it's failure that started in the middle of June so around 3 1/2  months to get it back and $60 in shipping. It's been fully tested and they replaced the bulb. For those who may need one here is the part number SP7G901GC01 It's cost is around $150 mine was covered under the warranty. I also have an extended one so now I have to determine if I should keep this or sell it. Since we use our theater room every night we purchased a new LED projector that we really love and as I mentioned before with the delays in factories and parts over the last 2 years you may also want to consider LED as they have no lamps to go bad and have much longer life spans 10-15 years but they do cost more or consider getting a spare bulb immediately as you will need one at some point.</span>

<span>The picture quality and brightness are the standout features here. They are as good as advertised! We can use this projector with our blinds open in living room, with direct sunlight pouring in, and the picture is still clearly visible. It's incredible impressive. On top of that, switching from a 720p projector makes the image quality on this absolutely stunning. It's so crisp, and everything we've put up there looks fantastic.<br/><br/>I definitely highly recommend this projector! I've already recommended this to my church, and we just upgraded to it for the sanctuary and it's working wonderfully from about 22 feet away. Again, we are able to clearly see the image even with some strong sunlight in the room!</span>

<span>review with updates over course of a year.<br/>But basically I love it, and it works out the box, but also has plenty of room to tinker the picture to your liking.<br/><br/>Day 1:  I opened up the box and plugged it in, just power and hdmi. Aimed it at the wall. It took a few seconds to warm up and then, even in broad daylight with no curtains, on pukey apartment tan/gray/green paint, there was vivid color and bright whites and a perfectly legible 9 foot playstation screen. This just feels magical. I adjusted the keystone to undo the distortion from the angle I had it at, played with the focus and zoom for a few seconds, and started playing some games. Even without extended game mode it was responsive enough to play some resogun, so I turned game mode on (not just the color setting, the low lag) to try it out. The keystone undoes, so my quick setup ran the top of the screen into the ceiling, but it was so smooth, so pretty, so big. Like I feel like a kid and this is magical watching black screens look like wall then in slides a logo or loading screen and then it's a game on my wall. Is it a little washed out in daytime? Yeah, the blacks aren't super deep around noon, but perfectly watchable even if you don't close the curtains, and your eyes adjust better than it can look in a photo to make the blacks look black next to the amazing whites. Is it amazing in the dark? Yes. Even after around 4pm with no curtains, when you don't even need a room light on yet, blacks look deep black next to the brights and everything is rich. Is it magical? Always. Is it good for gaming? Yes. I am very very impressed. Been gaming for decades and I never want to use a tv again, the brightness on this and the size make a rich deep picture with a wow factor even just on an off-color wall with no prep. I bought a sound system in expectation that the built in speaker would suck, but it's about on par with decent tv speakers and serviceable. Great volume actually, I have yet to turn it above 3. I got this to treat myself and holy **** it's amazing. Highly recommend. Just do it. It weighs so much less than a tv and is so magical. Great color and brightness and good for gaming and watching Netflix or whatever. I am so excited to play everything on this I feel like I just bought a second childhood. It has no business looking so good in the daytime.<br/><br/>Considerations after a few weeks: use "game" or "hdr sim" in daytime, it blows out the whites but the contrast and brightness is so much better. The dynamic brightness is supposed to give you 15,000 hours of life, that's like 10 years of 4 hours a day, but you can hear the fan speed change, and the brightness ramp up can be noticeable and distracting when brightness changes on screen back and forth: not usually noticeable on games, but on some shows where dialogue cuts back and forth. If you want 240hz and atmos, good luck. You would need the right dual outputs on your pc to go straight to the projector and av receiver, as the projector only has stereo out, and I don't think there is an a receiver or splitter on the market that can do 1080p240hz, best I can get is 1080p120hz or 4k60hz, which is still exceptional. Those considerations said, I still highly recommend this, it's amazing.<br/><br/>After a few months: still loving it. I think the only complaint is that on dynamic brightness the whites get crushed a bit on hdr from my PS4, this can probably be solved by switching to the non dynamic bright mode. On hdr in general, the dynamic black ramping will occasionally create banding and white blowout on transitions of dark to bright content too, the response time of the lamp and pixels seem to differ, this could probably be solved in a firmware update. Still highly recommend. It's a 4k60,1080p240hz projector with gaming speed and insanely good brightness and color. Nitpicking aside nothing compares to this. Pair with a surround or Atmos sound system and it's a perfect home theater.<br/><br/>1 year update: still loving it and highly recommend it. I run my PC at 1080p120hz for movies upscaled with svp, and PS5 at 4k60. I stopped using HDR because the picture looks better without it, as it crushes whites and blacks on dynamic brightness mode. Overall the only downside is that around noon the picture is washed out, and you need to either pump the contrast up to about 30, or close the curtains. Best display I've ever used, don't even need game mode it's not laggy.  Possibly the best purchase I've ever made.<br/><br/>I eventually found the setting that was blowing out the whites in dynamic brightness mode, in the image settings screen scroll, to the second page and there's some trademark sounding color menu like tru color or vibrant color or something, it's basically a second contrast scaler. I still usually leave it on the default setting for the brightness boost for a clearer image with lights on, but if you're doing movie night with the lights off, setting it lower will give you a better reference image, which of course there's an image preset for anyway.</span>
