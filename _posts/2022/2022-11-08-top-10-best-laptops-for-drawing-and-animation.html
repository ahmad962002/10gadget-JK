<div class="slideshow-container">
<blockquote><em><div class="a-row a-spacing-small review-data"><span class="a-size-base review-text review-text-content" data-hook="review-body">
<span>This Chromebook is dirt cheap and would be great for a student on a budget or someone who just needs to use a few apps and browse the internet.  I use it as a writing laptop, as I don't want to take my expensive, bulky gaming laptop all over the place.<br/><br/>Despite being plastic, it does seem to be solid.  The matte finish is a fingerprint magnet, though it's not a big deal.  The battery life is good, and as far as Chromebook keyboards go, it's fine to type on and better than some I have encountered in the past.<br/><br/>It's fast enough, though it's not zippy and will struggle with heavy apps or opening too many at once.  The screen is also not exactly beautiful and looks very dated.  Still, do you really need a nice screen on a $100 Chromebook?  You also need to be aware that Chromebooks basically have an update expiration date, so before you think you're getting a sweet deal on one, be sure to look up when it will stop receiving updates.  I believe this one is good until 2026 or 2027, which is enough time to get enough bang for your buck.<br/><br/>If you're aware of this Chromebook's limitations, this may be a nice buy.  It suits my needs, and honestly I can't stomach the idea of paying much for a Chromebook in the first place.  I won't feel sick if it gets lost or stolen while I lug it around, but it does what I need it to do well enough.</span>

<span>Day one, and the Ideapad 3 started right up. I'm going to let it charge for a while before I complete the setup. One star deducted for no English setup instructions in the box.<br/><br/>Day 3. Just discovered it isn't a touch screen. No biggie, I hate touch screens anyway. I'm using a small wireless mouse, and it works fine. I'm not sure how much internal memory this unit has, but I just stuck a 64 gb sd card in it so that'll be fine.<br/><br/>I bought this for a specific meeting - to see if I could drive a presentation on a large screen tv without having to bring a full featured laptop or tablet and to see if I'd like a Chromebook better than a tablet. Today, I hooked this little Lenovo Chromebook up to a big screen via the usb c port and it works fine. Had to buy the special cable with the HDMI on the other end but it was inexpensive and it came the next day from Amazon. What I really like about this little gem (if it continues to work...) is that it has regular usb ports as well - 2 of them! My Lenovo M10 tablet has none and thus there's no way to input or output data via cable. This is proving to be an interesting experiment.</span>

<span>I got a replacement and it's exactly what I wanted! Lightweight and the learning curve isn't so bad if you've never used a chromebook before, it only took me a few days to get used to it. It's very different from a normal computer and only good for light browsing and writing, I also got a large micro sd card for storage since it's barely got any, but I love it!<br/><br/>OLD REVIEW:<br/>The laptop itself is adorable, I love the look and feel of it, but I was either sent a broken computer or it was broken by the postal service handling it too roughly. It booted quickly, at least, so my disappointment was immediate. :(<br/><br/>I've put in for a replacement, so I'll be updating my review once that one arrives in two days.</span>

<span>Chromebooks have a life cycle of 8 years - this one was made in 2020, so it has about 6 or so years of support left. I didn't care and all I wanted was something small and light so I could write on my bed. I don't mind that it's a chromebook - in fact, this is my first chromebook and I'm in love. I'm planning to get another one for Black Friday if the price is good enough, because I love this one so much (I[m planning to have an indoor chromebook and an outdoor chromebook). The screen is a bit iffy, but it's good enough. I use this one more than I do my $700 tablet. I don't do anything heavy with it, so this is perfect for my needs.</span>

<span>Okay so let me just start off by saying that I have never used a Chromebook or a detachable tablet with a keyboard before. This was my first one in both cases.<br/><br/>Let's start with the Chromebook side of it. Before buying this product, I had done some research on how Chromebooks work and I thought I would be able to adapt to them. Boy, was I wrong! The GUI is too MacOS-like and as someone who is a long time Windows user, I was hoping for something more familiar. One thing I realized right away was that I had to be logged into my Google account at all times and that gave me an uneasiness of feeling like a data-mine. I also tried playing games on it but it just didn't work out. The feeling of gaming on it is super awkward and sometimes the games would lag.<br/><br/>Alright now let's move on to the tablet/keyboard side of it. The keyboard is a lot flimsier than I expected. The tablet itself is very bulky compared to mainstream tablets like iPads. The back cover is completely magnetic and can come off entirely which happened a few times when I was trying to set it upright. One important thing this device made me realize was that I'm just not into tablets.<br/><br/>I thought this product would help substitute my laptops but instead I learned a very important lesson from all this. Be happy with what you've got. Some things are just not worth it. If you've used Chromebooks or tablets with detachable keyboards before, then maybe this device won't be a problem for you. But if you've never used either one, then let this be a cautionary tale.</span>

<span>Battery lasts a good 2-3 days when just doing mostly word processing with an hour of watching videos. I enjoy the tablet design. Pen works well and automatically charges while docked.<br/><br/>Only problem is the keyboard. When it sits on your lap, the mouse pad does not work as it needs a hard surface under it.</span>

<span>You might think that only 4 gb for a Windows 10 laptop that cant expand the ram is a bad idea... Well, I've found this small laptop is actually fine, even quick for internet browsing, email, word processing and watching videos.  Sure, the keyboard is smaller, but even with large hands, I had no trouble typing...<br/><br/> Obviously, this is not a good choice for gaming or video editing work.  Battery life is very good for the intended basic uses; not Apple Ipad good;  but should give you at least 6+ hours for the basics...<br/><br/> It DOES have a micro SD slot, in addition to the 2 USB ports.<br/><br/>While you can't expand the RAM, you can also expand the storage with an internal NVME stick.<br/><br/>This is a great idea as it noticeably speeds up the computer if you make it the boot drive.  I added a 500GB Samsung 980 NVME stick and am very pleased with the results.<br/><br/>Having read about issues with the Samsung Magician cloning software, and difficulties in making a boot drive change work well on this laptop; let me tell you what worked well for me...<br/><br/>Ordered the Samsung nvme stick, along with a $15 external USB enclosure for this type of chewing gum stick size drive. Downloaded the free version of Easeus Partition Master software to clone the built in Asus L210 drive. Loaded the new stick in the external drive enclosure, connected the drive with a USB cable to a USB slot on the Asus, and followed the directions to clone the Asus C drive.  Opened the Asus and inserted the Samsung stick into the open nvme slot. Pressed power button holding down F2 key to get into bios.<br/><br/>Change the boot order to start with the nvme stick. Save and exit. Booting then detected issues with Windows, so choose to download and install a new, clean copy of Windows 10.  ( If you do this right after you have received the Asus, then you don't have any reason to save data or settings on this Windows clean install.  You don't yet have any personal data to save.)  When Windows is finished with the reinstall, make sure to do your windows updates.<br/><br/>After that is done, use Disk management tool to reformat the original drive,  and resize the partitions on the new nvme drive to what is available.<br/><br/>Now your little, inexpensive laptop is faster, with plenty of drive space.  Certainly one of the better values you can get in a very portable size, great for traveling when you may not want to carry a larger, more expensive laptop.  Screen quality is very good, and the Asus has a full size hdmi out for easy video sharing.  Definitely recommended for the price point and its intended use.</span>

<span>When you buy this, just know that you won’t have a lot of internal storage to work with. I bought an sd card to handle my storage effectively. When you get close to having the internal storage met, expect performance issues. The computer will work slower and just seem to struggle with keeping up.<br/><br/>This is NOT a gaming laptop. Please consider buying a different laptop if you wanted to game. It really doesn’t have the frame rate to handle games that are large. I used this laptop to play Roblox with students of mine and 9/10 this laptop could not keep up.<br/><br/>As for a work laptop it’s lightweight and easy to use. I use this laptop for zoom meetings(with an external camera, not the internal one), homework, writing and casual browsing. It does this job well. I generally won’t watch anything on it because the audio quality isn’t great, but if I had to use this laptop I would play the audio with headphones or a speaker.<br/><br/>Overall for school, work, or causal browsing Id definitely recommend this laptop.<br/><br/>PS this is not a backlit keyboard.</span>

<span>I bought this machine because I was looking for a small, inexpensive machine with good battery life to use for writing and media consumption when travelling, without having to worry much about it being damaged, broken or stolen.<br/><br/>This laptop comes with a 64GB eMMC disk which is small and not very fast. I bought an M.2 SSD to add to this laptop as the primary disk (I bought a Western Digital SN550 SSD). To add the M.2 SSD, you have to remove the ten screws at the bottom of the laptop (there are two different lengths of screw, so mark the holes with the longer screws when removing). Removing the bottom cover is a bit tricky because it is very tight - start at a corner and insert plastic credit card or similar into the gap, Then pull the credit card around the seam to pop off the clips (the trick is to not push the credit card too far into the seam, or it will get caught. Insert it only a tiny bit into the seam and it will glide easily). Once you have removed the bottom cover the place to insert the SSD is labelled on the motherboard. You just push it in, then add a single screw to secure it. The screw doesn't ship with the SSD usually, but if you need one you can buy a kit for a few dollars - search for "M.2 mounting screws" and you can get a kit with screws and screwdriver in the correct size, which can also be used to remove the case screws.<br/><br/>Once you've added the SSD, it won't appear in windows until you've formatted it in disk manager, which you can open by searching for "disk" in start menu and hitting "create and format hard disk partitions".<br/><br/>Once formatted, you can use it as a regular disk, but for best performance, reinstall windows on the SSD. To do that, create Windows 10 installation media - search google for "Create installation media for Windows" then follow instructions. You'll need a USB drive that's 8GB or bigger.<br/><br/>Once you've created installation media, install Windows on SSD (hit F2 when booting laptop to get into BIOS to select startup disk). Drivers are available from ASUS site (search "asus L210 drivers" then hit "support"). Windows will automatically find the digital license for your machine and activate.<br/><br/>Running on the SSD, performance for the machine is very good considering the price. Processor is fast enough to watch 4K youtube videos, should you wish to. Keyboard is fine-to-good. Touchpad is OK - good considering price. Speakers are not great, but good enough for watching youtube and as good as I would expect for this price and size. There is no backlit keyboard but that's not something I care about. Screen is fine, good for price. Overall build quality feels very good compared to other units in this price range. Machine feels light.<br/><br/>Battery life is excellent - using windows 10 "battery saver" mode (activate by pressing speech bubble in bottom right of task bar then hitting battery save) I routinely get 12 hours or more with normal usage and medium brightness, which is really excellent for the price in my opinion.<br/><br/>If you want a small, cheap machine with very good battery life and decent performance, and you are willing to add the M.2 SSD, this is a great choice.</span>

<span>I'm giving this little engine that could five stars. Why? Well, it's two hundred dollars. So I'm reviewing it as a two hundred dollar product. If I was comparing it to a Macbook Air M1, it would probably be three stars. If I was comparing it to a Microsoft Surface, three and a half. But it's a small, budget laptop, and in that category, it's excellent.<br/><br/>QUICK RUNDOWN - It blows my mind how good of a job they did with this. I've used a lot of computers, and this one impresses me. If you've ever had a Chromebook, or even just a cheap (or perhaps even more expensive) laptop you'll feel the difference immediately. It has a few issues, none of which are deal breakers, but it has many, many pros. Read on.<br/><br/>PROS --<br/>Incredible Price to Performance Ratio<br/>Very well built, with no cheap parts<br/>Full-size, comfortable keyboard<br/>Small and lightweight<br/>Good design (add stickers if it's a little too plain for you)<br/>Full Windows 10 License, and no hardwired bloatware<br/>Internal NVMe slot and external SD Card slot<br/>I could keep going... it's $200.<br/><br/>CONS --<br/>No backlight keyboard (at least on the 11.6 model)<br/>Some irksome viewing angle problems<br/>Maddeningly little built in storage<br/>Almost too little RAM<br/>Realtek Wifi Card (explained why in the 'Linux' section)<br/><br/>I've divided the review into individual sections: webcam, speakers, performance, software, etc, so scroll down to the one that's most important to you, or read the review from top to bottom. They are (in order):<br/><br/>Introduction (above)<br/>Weight &amp; Build<br/>Keyboard and Trackpad<br/>Screen<br/>Battery<br/>Performance (including Gaming)<br/>Webcam<br/>Speakers &amp; Sound<br/>Software<br/>Linux<br/>Other (SD Card Slot, NVMe slot, HDMI output, heating, cleaning)<br/>Conclusion<br/><br/>Let me start with a few disclaimers. First, I've only been using it for a few weeks, which is about enough time to get a good sense of its mettle and iron out any problems it has. There's been a few things I've noticed that I've added to this review, (see 'performance' and 'screen') and I'll add more if more arise. No problem has been significant enough that it made me in any way wonder if it was worth. $200 is a really good price point.<br/><br/>The second disclaimer, is there's a few reviewers saying either A, they got a dud, or B, it clunked out on them after two years. Duds happen, with any product, this is no exception. So if mine does decided to go on the fritz, I'll update my review relative to the exchange process - I WON'T deduct stars *just* because it gave out. Second, if you get two years of solid use out of this, it's a good product. Just buy another one.<br/><br/>With that being said, let me get into the details.<br/><br/>WEIGHT AND BUILD - This is one of its greatest strengths, and rivals many laptops in higher price ranges. There's no creaks, no cheap plastic waiting to shatter, it's not a flimsy toy. It's a solid electronic. It feels right, in your hands, on your lap, on a desk. So many laptops try and woo you with larger screens or better specs [or, for the life of me, a lower price tag], and turn out to be cup coasters you have to plug in. Not this. It really feels like it has some life in it.<br/><br/>It's not obscenely light, like a MacBook Air, but you can move about and use it on your lap without strain. If traveling's your kind of thing, then the weight is sufficient. I would feel comfortable carrying it through an airport.<br/><br/>The screen hinge feels durable and like it won't be breaking anytime soon, and when you set it at the position you like, it stays. The laptop isn't super-ultra-mega thin, but it is thin, and that's a nice bonus. You could probably fit it in an envelope, just maybe a slightly larger envelope then the one Steve Jobs used.<br/><br/>KEYBOARD AND TRACKPAD - The keyboard, I'm in love with. It's full size; no cramping on tiny keys or accidentally presses. The give is decisive and gratifying, and it just feels good to use. The keyboard is actually the one (literally, the only one) thing I feel they cut a little too close to the corner on. There's no backlight. It appears as those some of the models have a backlight, though I'm not sure, but mine doesn't. (I got the 11.6 model). This can be a little frustrating, and I'm considering getting a book light so I can type in the dark. Again, this is a two hundred dollar laptop, so it is what it is. I'll make due.<br/><br/>Another note, is they put the 'delete' key right next to the power key. Shucks. A few times, I've gone to press the delete key, and the computer goes into sleep mode. This is more of an inconvenience than anything. Just press the power button again and it will start right back up where you left off. Still, if you're doing sensitive work, it's something to consider, and I'm sure you'll learn very quickly to be cautious.<br/><br/>Also, the 'enter' key is green. I thought this was strange, but I really like it. Hard to explain.<br/><br/>The trackpad is responsive and that click is also decisive and gratifying. I don't have any issues accidentally pressing it while I'm typing, and it's very good at doing what I expect it to. If I click or tap, the mouse clicks. If I click on the right, it right clicks. Scrolling is painless and intuitive and very nuanced. The numpad on the keyboard is a nice touch, though I would have traded it for a backlit keyboard.<br/><br/>SCREEN - Going back to where we started, this is a two hundred dollar laptop. You're not getting an Apple Retina display. It has some minor viewing angle problems you'll have to accommodate for. If you're looking directly at it, everything looks good - pure colors, no whitening. If you turn it horizontally or bend the screen back, there's a noticeable change in tone. It is what it is, and it likely won't interfere with your work. Just don't do color grading for professional photoshoots on it.<br/><br/>The screen resolution is just right. The screen is small, but there's enough room to do what you want and then some. This is one of the most significant factors in comfort. If it were cramped, it would give you a headache and strain your eyes. But they did a good job of making sure there's some breathing room with a healthy buffer zone around whatever it is you're focusing on. You feel like you can move and engage in multiple things.<br/><br/>There's a few reviews complaining it's not a touch screen. You can't please everyone. It's not something I feel is missing, especially for $200.<br/><br/>BATTERY - The battery life is on point. The time remaining Windows estimates seems to vary quite a bit, but I watched two movies and used it for 4 hours, and still had 17%. It's the kind of thing you can charge at night and it will last you the day under normal conditions. It also doesn't have quick charge, another little cut corner, but I'm not stressing about it. Then again, I'm around a power outlet most of the time. If quick charge is an issue for you, you're in the wrong price point.<br/><br/>Side note: the charging port really plugs in. You have to give it a little oomph to pull it out. Which can be a pro and a con. You definitely don't want to trip on the cord; the whole thing will go flying off the table. But you can reposition the device without having to worry about the cord falling out.<br/><br/>PERFORMANCE - This is actually one of its biggest strengths, and really surprised me. All the components come together to create a seamless experience. I was nervous about the odd named Intel Processor (N6 something something) but it turns out, it's actually an Intel Celeron. And only four gigs of memory? Doesn't seem like quite enough. But it somehow manages to muscle out the minimum, and have some left over. My guess is, this is largely due to the SSD. Just a few years ago, laptop manufacturers had two options for storage: a physical hard drive, which was expensive, bulky, and a power drain, or some sort of memory like a thumb drive. Both were slow and huge bottle necks.<br/><br/>Well, this thing has a Solid State Drive. And that makes all the difference. With a decent processor, just enough memory, and the SSD, it will breeze through any routine task you ask it to do: open Microsoft Word, surf the web, torrent files, play music, and it will do it all without a hitch. Performance, under reasonable conditions, should never be a problem: you'll never feel a pause or get frustrated.<br/><br/>I LOVE the original Warhammer: 40K: Dawn of War series. This plays it effortlessly, even with mods. Which is very welcomed. I can imagine it can also play Sins of a Solar Empire, Age of Empires, Among Us, Terraria, and maybe even Minecraft, if that's your kind of thing. Check out GOG.com (great old games) and you'll be surprised at what's out there. If you are planning to do some light gaming, the NVMe slot will really come in handy.<br/><br/>IMPORTANT EDIT: After using it for some weeks, the lack of RAM is starting to become an issue. Windows has done a good job managing memory, but even day-to-day tasks can overwhelm it. This expresses itself as stalled applications, dropped Chrome tabs, or even system notifications that the system has run out of Memory. It did reach a significant error, though - everything went black, and after a reboot, Windows wanted to help set up my system (which is a big error.) Luckily everything was intact, my files, settings and programs. So it's just kind of a startling headache.<br/><br/>I was running a few programs, nothing too demanding. So if you're planning on using this for anything more then Spotify and Chrome, be forewarned.<br/><br/>WEBCAM - The webcam is about what you would expect. It's a hefty 0.3 megapixels, but there aren't any dropped frames, and the color processing is alright. If you need a webcam on the fly, it'll due. If you use a webcam for any serious purposes, I would suggest investing in a nice one, which you were probably going to do anyway. The device will be able to handle it without issue.<br/><br/>Of special note, is the microphone, which is actually great. Audio comes through clear and audible, distinct and focused. If you do find yourself in a situation where you have to use the onboard webcam, the video quality won't be great, but you won't have any problem being heard and understood.<br/><br/>SPEAKERS &amp; SOUND - The speakers are placed under the device, pointing directly down. You would think this would make them impossible to hear, but it projects and doesn't distort the sound. I've watched a few movies, and haven't had an issue hearing them - it gets plenty loud. I'm a bit of an audiophile, (though there are many more advance then I), and what I can say about these speakers is they're passable. They're not so bad that you're getting irked with the sound quality, but they're not so good you would enjoy Beethoven's 5th. The various aspects of sound - the bass, and whatever else the other parts are called, are balanced and clear.<br/><br/>If you're using it for casual media use, the lackluster sound quality will fade into the background and you'll be able to enjoy whatever it is you're doing.<br/><br/>The headphone amplifier is decent and it appears they didn't skimp on it. I tested it with a pair of Sony MDR7506s (which are one-for-one studio monitors with a higher than average impedance.) The amplifier didn't quit reach optimal levels, but it produced clear and pleasing sound. (and it does have a nice kick to it.) For an onboard amplifier, it's more then adequate. If you're a real audiophile and use an external amplifier, the primary factor to consider is if the sound it's putting out can be boosted, and it definitely can.<br/><br/>SOFTWARE - There's a few pieces of bloatware you'll want to uninstall. McAfee, Skype, MyAsus. (if you don't know what bloatware is, ask the techy in your family to remove it for you.) Fortunately, none of them are hard coded into the software or hardware, so uninstalling them is straight forward and simple and can be done through 'Add or Remove Programs.' The laptop does come in Windows S mode (which is suppose to be a simpler version of Windows, but has some bothersome limitations for power users.) They made it extremely easy to convert into regular Windows 10. I clicked a button once and haven't had to worry about it since: full Windows 10.<br/><br/>LINUX - I'm not a super user when it comes to Linux. I do know enough to install and use it on a day-to-day basis, and for low-performance computers like this one, Linux is tantalizing. Unfortunately, the WiFi card in the system [as of 11/19/21] doesn't work with Linux and there doesn't seem to be any support on the horizon. Most people who need or prefer Linux have taken to using a USB WiFi antenna, an untenable inconvenience for most. Some people have been reporting switching out the NIC entirely, but I don't know enough to speak about that.<br/><br/>OTHER - What I find really helpful is the SD Card Slot. The 64 gigs of storage it comes with goes REALLY quick. I like to watch, uh, documentaries in public domain (like 'Joker' with Joaquin Phoenix). It's amazingly simple to plug in an SD card (I got a 256gb one for $45), set up uTorrent to load all the unfinished and finished torrents onto the card, and that solves the whole problem. Just about any SD card you buy will be fast enough to download movies and play one at the same time.<br/><br/>Other reviewers have pointed out it comes with a slot for an NVMe SSD. If you don't know what that is, it probably doesn't make much of a difference. If you do, it's a very helpful addition. Hooray.<br/><br/>It has tons of ports, which is great. Two USB ports, a USB-C port, the above mentioned SD card slot, an auxiliary port, and an HDMI port. I've used the HDMI port on a full screen TV, and it works for watching a movie. The quality of the movie file will make a difference - but the sound compression changes that are necessary with downloaded media [generally done through VLC] help a lot. It's not blu-ray, but performance doesn't seem to be affected by what's happening in a scene or the amount of sound.<br/><br/>If you're planning on using this for presentations, it's exactly what you want. Plug, play 'n forget.<br/><br/>During normal, unplugged, use you wouldn't be able to tell that it's turned on just by the heat. If you're running a process-intensive program or have it plugged in, it does heat up, but that's normal. You can use it on your lap without a worrying. I don't see heating being an issue. It's also fanless, which is a big deal if you live in a dusty environment. You won't slowly be running it into the ground just by using it, listening to the fan whir louder and louder as it tries to compensate for all the dust.<br/><br/>Side note: If it overheats, it'll just turn off. It won't hurt it.<br/><br/>I like to take good care of my computers, so ease of cleaning matters to me. Being fanless, that alleviates a lot of of the issues you would come across. Still, you can't access behind the keyboard, so it will be interesting to see how that plays out. You might be able to remove each key and clean it out, which would go a long way, but I wouldn't try it without doing some research and carefully weighing the benefits and risks.<br/><br/>Either way, do yourself a favor: buy a small pack of Q-tips, a little bottle of house hold cleaner (Pinesol works well), and lens clothes, and throw them in the bag or case you're carrying the laptop in. Occasionally go over the keyboard with the Q-tips and wipe down the exterior, and the lens cloth will come in handy a lot more then you think. I don't know if it will necessarily add to the life of the machine, but it will feel a lot better. And it's worth taking some pride in your devices.<br/><br/>CONCLUSION - The bottom line is, is it feels good to use. Everything from the keyboard to the performance to the build quality makes it a very enjoyable and complete experience: there's nothing really lacking that will get in your way. It's spectacular for day-to-day use, and it's got a little muscle to it. For $200, you're getting a real product, and it even has something to say to higher end laptops. If you decide to go with this, I think you'll be very pleased.</span>

<blockquote><em><div class="a-row a-spacing-small review-data"><span class="a-size-base review-text review-text-content" data-hook="review-body">
<span>I have only had this laptop for about a month.  Overall, I really like it so far and have had no trouble transitioning from Windows 10 to Windows 11, although I don't give this machine a lot of tasks; it's my travel computer and my bedside companion.<br/><br/>I did have a concern about the battery charging, though, and I want to alert people to the issue. If you don't want to read this review any further, just please remember to keep the Lenovo Vantage software on your computer in case you need it.<br/><br/>First, the laptop ships with a charger that is a small brick with a cable that has a three-prong wall plug and another cable that connects to the USB-C port on  the laptop.  I used the charger and the battery charged up to 100% with no problems.  I had my battery set to "Battery Saver" in the Windows 11 system settings.<br/><br/>The laptop does have the older type of round charging port, but you have to buy a separate charger to use it.  So that's what I did; I went to the Lenovo site and bought that charger---which by the way, is not too lightweight itself, but at least it's more manageable for use on trains and such, and it has the two-prong wall plug.<br/><br/>So last night, I decided I had better make sure the additional (travel) charger worked okay.  I noticed, though, that my battery was only charging up to 60% of capacity.  The charger was powering the machine, but the battery wasn't filling up.  I thought maybe the charger was defective.  At that point I switched to the charger that came with the laptop, but with that charger, also, the battery wasn't charging beyond 60%!  Oh, no!  At that point, I thought my laptop must be a lemon.  I downloaded an additional software from the Lenovo site, Lenovo Diagnostic Tool, and ran a test on the battery.  The battery test failed!<br/><br/>I remembered that another Amazon customer who had reviewed this laptop had complained that he couldn't charge his battery beyond 60%.  A Lenovo representative responded something about a setting that prevented full loading of the battery to extend battery life if the laptop is kept plugged in.  I looked for that setting in the Windows battery settings, and changed my Power Mode setting to Best Performance, but that didn't help.  I could find nowhere in the Windows Settings to get the battery to charge more fully.<br/><br/>Eventually, I looked in the Lenovo Vantage software, under More Settings, and found that my machine had been set (not be me, I swear) to Conservation Mode.  This setting is only in the Lenovo Vantage software, and is NOT the same as Battery Saver in the Windows settings.  Once I changed my laptop from Conservation Mode to Rapid Charger in Lenovo Vantage, my battery started charging again.<br/><br/>The purpose of Conservation Mode is to conserve the life of the battery if the laptop is continually kept plugged in.  Because that's how I use the laptop, I will continue to use Conservation Mode, but will try to remember to switch to Rapid Charge mode if I want to take the laptop to another location without taking along a charger.<br/><br/>I suspected that the travel charger I purchased separately had somehow triggered the computer to convert from Conservation Mode to Rapid Charge, but that is not the case.  If the computer is in Rapid Charge mode, either charger will charge the battery to 100%.  If the battery has a charge of less than 60%, and the computer is in Conservation Mode, either charger will charge it to 60%.  If the battery has a charge of between 60% and 100%, the computer is then put into Conservation Mode and plugged into either charger, the computer will be powered by the charger but the battery will not be further charged.<br/><br/>I hope this review is helpful.</span>

<span>This is my second Lenovo Flex Laptop. My previous one was a 2015 Flex 3 Model.So, obviously I like Lenovo.  I felt it was time for a new one. Its lighter than the old one and came with a pen. Works well. Working with Lenovo / Windows to fix a few issues-ie no Power Icon on Desktop-have to switch to Windows Start to turn off computer. I use the HDMI plug to connect to a monitor as I use more as a Desktop. Also have Keyboard and mouse.<br/>The Amazon Description did not match the Specifications-One example was USBs are 3.1 and not 3.2. With no Ethernet plug I got an adapter for the "C" plug and that's where I plug in ethernet instead of using WIFI. I have a DC plug for Power. Only has 2 USB's and I use one for Keyboard/Mouse. When necessary I have a nice USB HUB (Inateck) that expands to 4. The Lighted Keyboard is only on the top row-It sort of spreads down to the rest of the keyboard. The old Flex 3 was totally lighted. Overall I am going to like this one-It has 16GB RAM vs 8 GB on th eold one.</span>

<span>I've been a Mac user for over a decade, but wanted to make the switch (as I've had an Android phone for several years), but hesitated on the laptop switch. I've always been curious, but never even toyed with ChromeOS, so I dove in and bought what happens to be one of the highest reviewed Chromebooks under around $600 right now. Here's what's up:<br/><br/>SIZE<br/>Outside of the display, this is my favorite part of this laptop. While I loved the weight of the Macbook Air when it was released, I wanted a laptop that didn't make me feel like "Ah, man!" when I had to throw it in my bag to travel. I wanted something portable and light. And while there's not a huge difference in weight between the two computers, you'll notice that it's sleeker and feels smaller than maybe what you're use to.<br/><br/>DISPLAY<br/>I don't know the specs, you can research that, but what's true is what most every review will say and that's that it is beautiful! And while there are faster computers at this price range (and cheaper) I don't know that there's a better looking screen. It's a joy to look at and use, with one major flaw that I'll keep till the end.<br/><br/>TRACKPAD<br/>People are hatin' on this trackpad, and I don't get it. I've had a Macbook Air for almost 7 years before buying this computer and while it's noticeably a bit of a transition (i.e. seems like it takes more effort to scroll and drag), I got use to it. Even having gone back to the Macbook Air for some use, I've not noticed a large enough difference personally to consider it a deal breaker.<br/><br/>KEYBOARD<br/>People also be hatin' on the keyboard. It takes some getting use to, but I really enjoy it. I first bought the 4GB model and out the box the light behind the keys was flickering. When I returned it and got the 8GB, it wasn't, and has been solid so far. While I'm not typing where I need a ton of light behind the keys often, I've found that when I am, it's great. No complaints.<br/><br/>SPEED<br/>I don't know anything about processing speed or any of that, you can look it up, but I do know that 8GB of RAM is more than 4GB and that it was a noticeable difference between the computers. For a little more the 8GB it's worth it. Depending on what you're using the computer for, people say that 4GB is enough. I think coming from a Mac that had 8GB, I felt more comfortable with 8GB.<br/><br/>CHROMEOS<br/>This is probably null for anyone who is already in the ChromeOS world, or has been, but for me, coming from Mac, it took a lot longer than I thought it would to get adjusted. Some keys are in different places, and it's more worthwhile with a Chromebook to take a few minutes to memorize shortcuts than it is with a Mac. So, again, if you're coming from a Mac, my one recommendation would be to give yourself a few days to get use to it. I think it's worth the struggle, because after a few weeks I think I'm faster on my Chromebook than I was on Mac simply because all of the shortcuts and the search bar that will search everything on your computer, in Drive, and so on.<br/><br/>BLUETOOTH<br/>Maybe this was a slap in the face to Google, but having already purchased a bluetooth Apple keyboard and trackpad I wanted to see if they would work with the Chromebook (without having to purchase another set that would). At first it seemed to work flawless, but for whatever reason it sometimes takes for-ev-er to locate and connect to. And after doing a little bit of homework, it seems like this is an issue across a lot of Chromebooks and not specific to this computer. Just a heads up!<br/><br/>FATAL FLAW<br/>The one reason I haven't completely settled on this computer is because of the random flickering I've experienced with both the 4GB and the 8GB model. It happens randomly, sometimes multiple times an hour. It's a bar across the screen for a split second and then gone. It's not a huge deal, but if you're going to drop hundreds of dollars on something, you don't want it to flicker like that. Other people have reported the same and believe it's a Chrome extension problem and to wipe the computer completely and see (which doesn't take long and isn't as intense as doing it on a Mac as everything is web based on a Chromebook). I did this and still have had issues.<br/><br/>Hope this helps people in the search!</span>

<span>I purchased the C434 very near first availability date on Amazon after highly anticipating it's arrival.  I've always been a fan of Chromebooks and anxiously anticipated upgrading to this work of art (and it really is beautiful).  The build quality is excellent. The screen is amazing with those wonderful little bezels.  The screen is  bright and responsive and is a joy to look at and interact with in almost every respect.  The computer screams quality.  All of that said, after about three weeks with the C434, I decided to return it and ended up purchasing the HP X360.  Here are my reasons.<br/><br/>One of the initial reviews of the C434 complained about the keyboard.  The person's complaint didn't relate to the tactile interaction with the keyboard (which is good) but rather to the viewing of the keys on the keyboard (white on metal).  My initial thought on this, prior to receiving my own C434, was that this reviewer must be very short-sighted to return the computer for such a minor  complaint.  However, he or she was absolutely correct.  In the spirit of creating a very contemporary keyboard, the white letters on the aluminum keyboard results in a very difficult layout to see in daylight.  I would need to tilt and move the keyboard to position my hands properly (and I type very fast by touch so this is not a hunt and peck complaint).  In dim light with the backlight on, the keyboard transforms into a wonderful experience, but using it during the day was a frustration for me I couldn't get over.<br/><br/>I was also disappointed in performance.  Since I was an early adopter, I have the 4GB model with the core i3m processor.  For light web surfing and simple tasks it's fine, but if I wanted to view my Google photos, for example, or use the Android version of Lightroom from the App Store, there is a definite lag in performance.  I'm not sure if this relates to the 4GM of RAM or the i3m processor, but once I upgraded to the X360 (8 GB of RAM and a i3 U processor)  it was an entirely preferred performance experience.<br/><br/>So, to conclude, here is my compare and contrast of the C434 with the HP X360.<br/><br/>Price<br/>The HP X360 seems to be constantly on sale from it's $600 list price.  I got it for $450 but it can be had for as little as $399.  Great value at either of these reduced price options.  I was going to hold out for the C434 i5 with 8GB of RAM but I ultimately concluded that that price point would not come close to the X360 at its discounted price.<br/><br/>Screen<br/>The C434 is brighter and much nicer and has those little bezels.  This is the one aspect of the C434 I miss the most.  The X360 has only a bearable screen brightness and color output as compared  to the C434, but ultimately  this was a tradeoff I was willing to make (although I still struggle with).<br/><br/>Weight<br/>The C434 is about 1/2 pound less in weight and is marginally smaller.  Again, I would opt for the C434 in this case but the real world difference is really not that significant.<br/><br/>Keyboard<br/>I love typing on the X360. It's got a great feel and travel and nice backlight. The C434 was fine at night but that keyboard during the day was awful to use because of the white on metal.<br/><br/>Performance<br/>Hands down the X360 wins.  Ok , it has a fan that comes on occasionally, but it smokes the C434 with any use other than normal web surfing or simple applications. Using the X360 with the better processor and RAM is a joy compared to the C434.  Also, as an aside, I have noticed that Google Play Apps seem to run better on the X360 but I'm not sure why?  For example, I have an app that gives me notifications and when I clicked on the C434  it would not take me to the App but I have no problem at all with the X360 properly behaving in this regard.<br/><br/>Conclusion<br/>If you want a stylish Chromebook and your needs are limited to web surfing and light Applications, go for the C434.  If, however, performance is at all a concern and you plan to do some work or moderate play, I would opt for the X360. Both are wonderful machines in their own right and it's a pleasure to see the evolution of the Chromebook.</span>

<span>I'm not completely new to Chromebooks, my Children both use them for school and I've messed around with them off and on for a couple of years.  Recently my 10 year old Macbook's battery finally gave up and I found myself in the market for a new laptop.<br/><br/>I grabbed my son's Asus 302 and started messing with it to see what I could get it to do, and very soon realized that a Chromebook could meet the vast majority, if not all, of my day to day needs:<br/><br/>Since my Son's 302 has held up so well for over two school years of daily use... I decided to give this 434 a try.  I'm really glad I did.<br/><br/>The Great:<br/>The screen and itty-bitty bezel gives a whole lot of extra screen space in a size only a fraction larger than my Boy's 302.  It's a 14 inch screen in what is basically a 13 inch body.  The resolution, color fidelity and brightness are 100% fine for me.  In strong sunlight the screen struggles - but - really...  I can't see how I could ding it for that.  I ride a shuttle  bus to work with tinted windows.  If full sun is shining through the windows directly on the screen it gets washed out.  For the price I do not think you could expect much more.  If the light is not shining directly on the screen I've found it fairly easy to adjust brightness to compensate.<br/><br/>Size wise it is 100% perfect for me - maybe a little tight on that shuttle, but I'll take the extra screen any day.<br/><br/>Processing power and memory:<br/>Well - I have to say I wish I could have gotten a model with 8G or more memory...  That being said - I have no real regrets with the base model.  So far I can open as many tabs as I ever wanted to have open while also running a android app or two - sometimes even a Linux app or two, and I have not yet encountered a situation where I felt the machine was struggling.<br/><br/>The battery - OMG the battery!<br/>I'm coming from a 10 year old Macbook - so needless to say I was shocked on my first full day of using this thing...<br/>In the morning I got on the Shuttle (free shuttle WiFi - FTW!) for my hour long ride to the office - check my e-mail and then signed in to my desktop at work via Citrix/Chrome and started my workday.  Once at the office I spend another few hours working from a couch in the atrium instead of at my desk just enjoying that I can do this without worrying about where the nearest outlet is anymore.  Back on the shuttle and on the way home some last second work tasks and then streaming some YouTube and surfing.  Back at home - more web surfing, streaming some TV  shows to catch up.  Some genealogy research, played with a python script for awhile, and finally off to bed around 11.  The dang battery was still at 58%.  A month of day to day use says the battery life advertised is true in real life.<br/><br/>Cant praise the battery enough.<br/><br/>"Tent" configuration works awesome for streaming video in bed and the speaker placement works well like this to give really good audio.<br/><br/>What's kinda great:<br/>"Tablet" configuration...  It works and the speaker placement complements this setup as well - the only downside is this thing - for my taste -is really just toooooo big for really comfortable use as a tablet - except "flipping" it so the keyboard lays in your lap or on a surface with the screen angled works well in that use case...  Overall  on this point - I'm still glad I paid extra to have a device with this flexibility.  I have encountered situations where I have used each of the set-ups.<br/><br/>Android apps...  Sadly and I hope this gets better with time - many Android apps I'd like to use are not working on my Chromebook.  I see the "Not compatible with your device" message on the Play Store - or install the app and find it does not work properly.  Overall - The Android app on Chrome experience is Great-ish and I hope it continues to improve.<br/><br/>Linux(!)<br/>Linux support is BETA.  But - Great-ish.  LOL.  I've installed "Gramps" for some Family Tree research...  LibreOffice Suite for a offline MS Office like set of tools, and PyCharm IDE for working with Python.  All of these tools are working so far with little difficulties that I will not "complain" about at all - these tools work for me perfectly most of the time and perform well on the device. It is not a perfect world and I remind you that Linux support is "Beta".  Set expectations accordingly and if you like Linux - I think you will like it on a Chromebook!<br/><br/>What's OK:<br/>The keyboard...  Key travel, placement, "click-y" feel are awesome for me.  The OK part is the odd-ish design decision to color the keys silver with translucent white letters...  In certain lighting situations the letters on the keys - sort of vanish...  In nearly every case I've been able to work around this issue by adjusting the keyboard backlight - actually most of the time I have the key backlight turned off completely. This makes the letters look almost black in color - unless there is strong light on the keyboard...  That's when the white color of the letters make them nearly vanish against the silver background of the keys.  In any other lighting situation you can adjust the keyboard backlight to get at least a very workable if not 100% perfect experience - IMHO.  In a dark setting the backlight works fine and makes working in very dim or dark conditions easy.<br/><br/>The trackpad...  For me.  It is 100% OK...  Not something I'd call awesome - and not anything that is bothering me after a month of daily use.<br/><br/>So this is where my list ends.  I actually can not think of a single thing I'd say is bad or sucks.  I imagine if I got into really compute/io heavy video or graphics editing, or the giant pivot table from hell , or maybe the dreaded 100 page Powerpoint - I could make the thing struggle...  Note I am NOT a gamer either...  I just have to say that for at least 95% of what I do daily...  This is all I need.  I keep waiting on it to disappoint me - and it has not yet - quite the opposite.<br/><br/>One final-final note:  I dismissed Chrome OS for years thinking it was only good with a always on and fast internet connection.  That might have once been true but I think not anymore.  Getting offline work (or playing) done without a always on internet connection is entirely possible with minimal planning in advance.  In my humble opinion using a Chromebook without the internet connection is just as doable as working with any Windows or Mac based product when you are offline.</span>

<span>I’m not a tech person so bear with me on this review..<br/>I love this laptop! I had done some research on chromebooks after I decided to not spend tons of money on a MacBook. I am a grad student and need a laptop that would be good for word processing (I only use google docs anyways) and watching Hulu and Netflix. This laptop totally met and exceeded all my expectations and I love it.<br/><br/>It’s very light and thin, and fits perfectly in my backpack. I am obsessed with how there are charger ports on either side!!!<br/><br/>I don’t use the ‘flip’ that much, but it is nice sometimes. I kind of forget that it’s an option but I often have to read long PDF articles and turning it into a tablet and using a stylus to highlight is pretty nice. Also, the speakers are on the very bottom which is not the best sound so if I’m really trying to zone out and watch a movie I will flip it so the speakers are up and the keyboard isn’t between me and the screen. it sounds great like that! The speakers are actually decently loud.<br/><br/>The battery life thing on this is amazing. It can last me all 8 hours while I’m at school and usually can charge my phone as well. I’ve had it for about 6 months and have lately started noticing the battery life is maybe not quite as long lasting as it was when I got it, but I’m still really impressed.<br/><br/>Again I’m not a tech person. I chose this laptop because of Wirecutter’s review and because my fiancée said the specs looked good compared to other chromebooks I was considering. For my purposes, it works great. It’s fast loading webpages, fast downloads, never have a problem streaming anything. Performance wise it is excellent.<br/><br/>The only time I get slightly annoyed with it is that sometimes it drops to WiFi signal for no apparent reason. I can’t absolutely guarantee that this is because of the laptop and not my router, but it happens other places as well. It’s not a constant problem but sometimes I’ll be doing something and all the sudden I will have no internet and i will have to click to the network settings and then it suddenly will be reconnecting to the network. It only happens maybe a couple times a week and it didn’t happen at the beginning.<br/><br/>It should be said that with a chromebook there are a few drawbacks. There are sometimes when it’s frustrating to not be able to get the “desktop” version of an app/website, like Spotify. You can either use Spotify web or get the android app for Spotify, and both of these have slightly less functionality than the desktop app that you could install on a windows or PC. That’s just an example but yeah sometimes there are slightly annoying things about running chrome OS but overall I can do everything I need to do and I’m super happy with this purchase. I recommend this laptop to everyone!!!<br/><br/>Cons<br/>Speakers on the bottom, slightly muffle the sound unless you flip it.<br/>Battery life slightly diminished after 6 months of regular use<br/>Sometimes dropped WiFi signal for a couple seconds and needs to reconnect<br/><br/>Pros<br/>Speakers are lOud<br/>Excellent battery life<br/>Touch screen works great<br/>Nice keyboard<br/>Very fast loading webpages, streaming, etc.</span>

<span>I got this for my elderly mother-in-law who uses a computer almost exclusively for emailing. So she doesn’t need a whole lot of memory; 4/64 gigs is plenty of memory. At this price point, it’s a surprisingly attractive and solidly made laptop—comparable in initial quality, fit/finish to a MacBook. By far the worst aspect of this unit is the inclusion of Windows ‘S’ mode. The ‘S’ stands for safety; I have another word in mind! I won’t go into the ugly details here; half of the other reviews will do that. Suffice it to say that I opted out of ‘S’ mode, despite the possible risks/downsides. Many have complained about the keyboard; I see no problem with it whatsoever. Other than the ‘S’ mode issue, the laptop itself may just be the best inexpensive PC I’ve encountered.</span>

<span>So we just got this laptop a couple days ago, and I'll update things as they go along. Firstly it's a pretty decent laptop for the money, trying to read reviews on it is a pretty mixed basket because they have so many other cheap/er laptops that most of the reviews are not for this one. So you'll have to pay attention to the model number they are reviewing. (Acer Aspire 5 A515-56-702V)<br/>Here's a couple of my deciding points which lead to the purchase:<br/><br/>- Aluminum case (not super thick but still not plastic) has a more sturdy feel to it (within reason as this is not a $2K laptop).<br/><br/>- Solid Intel i7 Processor, first came to market Sep 2020. Good sized cache.<br/><br/>- It has a 512GB NVMe SSD drive in it which is the M.2 format, these are some of the fastest drives out right now as far as standards go. Most laptops with SSD are taking about the SATA drives, which while fast, are not anywhere close to the M.2 speeds.<br/><br/>- Being that it's an M.2 drive this leaves an entire drive bay empty in the laptop for future storage upgrade (SATA) if needed or having an alternate backup drive right in the laptop etc. (i.e. expandable in the future if you need it)<br/><br/>- It has 16GB of memory, I'm not sure why so many laptops out there only have 8GB, just running basic windows will eat at least 5GB+ of memory which doesn't leave a lot left for everything else. (In my humble opinion) and I appreciated the ability to upgrade that further in the future if needed to 24GB.<br/><br/>- It has plenty of USB ports and HDMI out for conference rooms/TV's etc.<br/><br/>Some of the cons:<br/>- The power adapter is a very small "pin" power adapter. Needless to say this was rather disappointing because we all know that sometimes cords get pulled or bumped etc. And it's likely to damage the internals because it's very small. I would have liked to see one of the thicker power adapter connections just for strength.<br/>- Windows 11 - Personally I'm not a huge fan thus far but mainly just for functionality reasons like you can't ungroup open programs on the task bar, it's one icon and that's it with no ability to change it. It's not a tablet it's a computer.<br/>- No Thunderbolt Port<br/>- No option to charge via USB C (which would negate the very tiny pin adapter)<br/><br/>So we did run into a couple issues. We had a problem with the laptop not seeing the power cord plugged in, it would blink as if it was going to start working (windows battery page in settings) then act like it was never plugged in. We reached out to Acer and they had us reset the battery via a paperclip and pin hole on the bottom. It's worked find so far after that. Getting a tech on the online chat via Acer support was fast and he was able to quickly resolve the issue.<br/><br/>So generally, this being my very first Acer Laptop, I'm pleased with things so far. We'll see how it holds up in the long run.</span>

<span>This is the 4th one of these that I've bought!  With it being all solid state, battery life is excellent.  Startup is very fast.  I've added a second SSD to two of them with no problems.  It even comes with the necessary hardware to add it.  It's not fast enough for intensive gaming but plenty fast for games like Minecraft, which the kids like.  Being solid state also makes it quite rugged.</span>
