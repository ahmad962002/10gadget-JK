<span>I replaced a 24" 2k monitor with this 32" 4k monitor as my second monitor.  I use mostly office applications but do look at engineering drawings a fair amount and the 2k monitor was looking a little fuzzy compared to my other 4k monitor so I decided to upgrade.  This is about as large of a monitor as I would care for with a 2 monitor setup.  I wouldn't want any more neck rotation to see everything.  The new 32" is very clear.  I can look at full size P&amp;ID drawings and actually read all of the instrumentation bubbles while viewing the full sheet.  On the smaller monitor I would have to zoom in to read it, then loose the big picture where all of the connecting lines go off page to various components.  Sharp screen and good upgrade for $300.  Highly recommend.  I don't do gaming so I can't comment on that type of usage for this monitor.  I have watched streaming video and the picture is excellent for that.</span>

<span>Great video.  EZ package removal.  EZ set up; aside from the whole no audio thing.<br/><br/>I'm legally blind, so use the monitor in dark mode.  The 4k, and as good a black as I've seen, combine for an image that makes work still possible.  It's awesome, and only two negatives to cite.<br/><br/>The convenience of a single joystick controller is dulled because the interface screen it drives is a little picture in picture down in the corner.  I didn't measure, but maybe 2.5" x 2.5".  Not Samsungs fault I'm legally blind, but I think this would be an annoyance for most.<br/><br/>And the lack of speakers.  Just why?  Again, easy to overcome, but this is for home office use.  I don't need an external speaker cluttering my desk, but I do use monitor speakers for Teams / Video Call interface.  I'll be honest, I didn't check if it had speakers, or even review their quality.  Some things you just expect, so a let down, and the reason it's a 4 star monitor.</span>

<span>So for anyone who is lookin for a cheap 4k monitor this is a great choice. At first i was disappointed because on my xbox one x it wasn’t displaying 4k UHD resolution. But then i switch it from HDMI 1 too 2 an boom it worked i hoped I've saved y'all a headache.</span>

<span>There are tons of reviews, so I'm going to get straight to the point. There were a couple things that were required, and a couple things I wanted in a new monitor. Some context, I work from home and I'm getting my Masters degree online, so I often spend 50-60 hours a week at my computer. I wanted to get a monitor I would be happy with for work and play for several years. I like the ultrawide aspect ratio a lot, so that's what I was looking for primarily. I've now had the monitor for about 4 months.<br/><br/>Required:<br/>- 34+ inches ultrawide<br/>- 75hz+ refresh rate<br/>- 1440p+ resolution<br/>- VESA mounting<br/>- Freesync/G-Sync<br/>- Good build quality/long-lasting<br/>- Curved (upgraded from a flat 34in monitor)<br/>Wanted:<br/>- 144hz+<br/>- Vibrant colors, good contrast<br/>- HDR<br/>- Thunderbolt docking<br/><br/>First off, when I bought this monitor it was on sale for $650. It was a bit more than I wanted to pay, even though that is cheaper than regular price, but I decided to shell out the money because it hit all of my needs and most of my wants (I actually didn't notice that it didn't have HDR until after I bought it but that wasn't a deal breaker). I'll go through them and score them individually using a number of stars.<br/><br/>-34 inch ultrawide (5*) - exactly what I wanted, nothing else to comment.<br/>-Refresh Rate (4*) - 100hz is the best I've ever had and I'm happy with it. More might be better, but I currently don't have a computer that can even handle 100hz all the time when gaming so it doesn't really make much of a difference, however I recognize it might be lacking for some people.<br/>-Resolution (5*) - I just upgraded from a 1080p, and I don't have a fantastic GPU, so again, I'm happy with it for just about everything.<br/>-VESA mount (2*) - Not my favorite. Instead of just putting the mount right on the back like most monitors, this one has an adapter that attaches to the existing adjustable arm. I have this mounted to my own monitor arm. What that means is that there are now 2 pivot points for vertical adjustment on this monitor, one on the monitor itself, and one on the arm. It is functional, but I would much rather just mount right to the back of the monitor instead.<br/>-Freesync (3*) - Freesync doesn't work through the thunderbolt connection, and this was not mentioned anywhere. I could have done my own research to discover that, so I recognize this is partially on me, but it should be made clear and that bugs me that it was not mentioned anywhere.<br/>-Build Quality (4*) - I haven't had any issues with this, it seems to be working fine and not showing any signs of wearing out, but there is a lot of plastic, and I'm not crazy about the mount system. So, it's pretty good, but could be better for this price.<br/>-Curve (5*) - 1500R seems perfect to me. Not too aggressive, very comfortable.<br/>-Colors, contrast (5*) - This is the best screen I've used to be honest. I'm not as picky as some people are, so I'm sure some people will have their complaints, but the screen is amazing in comparison to my old monitor (cheap VA panel). I love the QLED, bright colors, great contrast. I'm happy with this part.<br/>-HDR (1*) - No HDR. This was my fault that I wasn't paying attention though. Still a point against this monitor though.<br/>-TB3 Docking (1*) - I'm not happy with the TB3 docking. This is one of the primary reasons I bought this monitor over others, but it doesn't completely work. I use this monitor on 3 different computers for different things, so I wanted the docking capability (rather than just buying an expensive separate dock) to make my life easier when switching around all the time. Issue 1, no Freesync through TB3. This isn't exactly Samsung's fault, but that needs to be made clear. Issue 2, the TB cable that it comes with does not support daisy-chaining monitors. If you're going to sell a monitor and advertise that it can daisy-chain, then it had better support daisy-chaining out of the box. This was a ripoff to me. I had to buy a separate cable, which aren't exactly cheap. Issue 3, USB plugs in the monitor don't work properly. I have a couple of devices that work, but most don't, so even though it is in USB hub mode and is supposed to be just the TB3 cable I switch between computers (and leave all peripherals connected to the monitor), this doesn't work and I have a separate USB hub that I move around also. I contacted support about this and the only way to do anything about it would be to ship the monitor to a service center where they would keep it for several days/weeks to service it, but I use this monitor 50-60 hours a week. I can't afford to be without it that long.<br/><br/>tl;dr - great quality monitor if you're looking for curve, vibrant colors, lots of space, but don't get it for the docking because it doesn't work as well as it should.</span>

<span>I have to confess, this was a complete impulse purchase. I already have an eight year old 27" inch ASUS PB Series PB278Q Monitor that was considered somewhat of prosumer PLS monitor suited for those focused on video and photo editing. In that regard, purchasing a Samsung VA panel could be considered a step down from a PLS. Logically, if I was going to purchase a widescreen monitor and I wanted to retain the picture quality I have become used to, the sensible choice would have been one of LG's IPS monitors. However, I clicked on the "add to cart" for this Samsung...whether it was the price, the QLED marketing hype or the mixture of features that made me pull the trigger I don't quite know.<br/><br/>I had a few reservations when I purchased it. 1) the fact it was a VA panel. 2) A string of reviews mentioning dead pixels, 3) The severe curve of the monitor....would it be impossible to get used to.<br/><br/>1) Yes, a degree of colour shift is seen, but 99.9% of the time it's not noticeable when sitting in front of the monitor. However, I did come across on instance it was quite noticeable. There is one video game I play where there is a window positioned in the upper left hand corner. It's green with large bevels having a slightly different shade of green. For some reason there is a noticeable inversion of  colour between the window and the bevel as you move your head a few degrees. Not a big deal....unless you are using the monitor for serious graphics or photo editing.<br/><br/>2) No dead pixels. Overall manufacturing seems quite good (for $650, I certainly hope so!)<br/><br/>3) I was quite worried about the curve since  I have never used a curved monitor. I can see both the pros and cons of curved monitors. Well, after a week's use it's starting to feel quite natural. Never underestimate the human animal to adapt given a sufficient amount of time.<br/><br/>Other thoughts.....<br/><br/>  Make sure you desk is deep enough. The thrusting forward of the stand plus the curved back makes the actual depth of the monitor quite large.<br/><br/>  Built-in speakers aren't too bad. Perfectly adequate for voice and Skype calls, music, not so much.<br/><br/>  The matte finish on the screen is quite modest. Although it does a great job eliminating reflections from the ambient surroundings any light source behind you like a  window or lamp  will be a brilliant blob on your screen. You will need to position your monitor and arrange lighting as if it were a glossy.<br/><br/>  Gaming with the widescreen and freesync has been an noticeable improvement over the 16:9 and just v-sync.<br/><br/>  Works flawlessly on Linux Mint.<br/><br/>Conclusion<br/><br/>  A great monitor for those who use their computer for a mixture of general office work, emails, web browsing, and gaming. It's suitable for those of us who play around with Photo/video editing and other graphics applications. For those who do Graphics design or video editing professionally, or those who do it for a hobby, but take it very seriously, this might not be the monitor (or any VA panel) for you.</span>

<span>Bought this BenQ display for my new Apple Mac Studio due to the reviews about color accuracy. I do love the size (32") and the color accuracy. However, I also edit many videos and it's imperative to have good audio in order to avoid over editing the audio. Unfurtunately, the speakers on this "pro" display seems to belong to a laptop. The speakers are just aweful so plan on buying a better sound system which will add to the cost of the entire system. I just bought the Klipsch ProMedia 2.1 THX Certified Computer Speaker System for better sound but it has yet to arrive so I can't say how it would work together.</span>

<span>The TL;DR is simple: I have found the SW321C to be a phenomenal, no-compromises, nearly flawless monitor. Great stand, great user interface (I love the puck), outstanding image quality, even backlight, no backlight bleed. It's superb for work and leisure. There's IPS glow, but that's unavoidable.<br/><br/>I'm a programmer who spends most of his time on his computer -- reading/writing text, watching video, and playing games. Previously I was using 2 Dell U2518D monitors, which, even after calibration with an iDisplay Pro Plus, had the following issues:<br/>* Crushed blacks<br/>* Poor contrast<br/>* Uneven colors<br/>* Uneven backlight<br/>* Backlight bleed<br/>* Glare, despite the matte surface<br/><br/>After deciding I didn't want to put up with those issues any longer, I did a week or two of research on what the best no-compromises monitors were in late 2020. That led me to the SW321C, a professional monitor rather than a gaming/consumer monitor, because consumer models -- no matter how fancy they claimed to be or how slick the marketing -- all seemed to fall short and require me to resign myself to compromises in at least one area (and I didn't want FALD).<br/><br/>The BenQ SW321C is expensive (though not as expensive as the EIZO and Dell screens that it's often compared to), but I consider the money well spent. The image quality is outstanding. Colors are stunning. Images and text are markedly sharper and crisper than they were on my 25" 1440p monitors (though this would be true of any 4k 32" screen). The backlight is the evenest I've ever seen. There's no backlight bleed that I can detect. I love the shade hood and never take it off. The matte coating is far and away the best I've seen/used.<br/><br/>For the movies and tv shows I've watched on it (Blade Runner, Ex Machina, The Witch, The Expanse, The Man in the High Castle, The Midnight Gospel), I couldn't be happier with the quality of the picture. The HDR may be "fake," but it still massively improves the viewing experience, especially in regard to handling of darkness/shadows.<br/><br/>Last year I bought and returned the BenQ SW271. I loved it, but the backlight was uneven, there was backlight bleed, and 27" was too small for 4K". (32" is, for my eyes (late 30s), the perfect size for a 4k screen.) If I was going to spend $1,500, I wasn't willing to put up with those issues.<br/><br/>The SW321 isn't as bright as the SW271, which is a shame, but it also fixes every issue I had with the SW271.<br/>==<br/>Update: the blacks aren't as dark as I'd like them to be. (EDIT: correction, for $2k you can NOT get a very decent oled tv with perfect blacks. You will experience burn in.) The monitor also seems to produce a lot of heat. I'm not sure I regret the purchase. It still ticks all the boxes for me, and I consider the money well spent, but if I could do it again, and my living quarters allowed it, (EDIT and recantation: I would not opt for an OLED)<br/><br/>Update #2: Scratch that. I still wish the blacks were darker, but this is as good as it gets on an IPS panel. OLED TVs aren't meant to be used as PC monitors, and if you use one that way, there will inevitably be burn in. I'm still quite happy with the purchase, despite the one, single, occasional stuck sub-pixel.<br/><br/>I've seen a few reviews here that fault the hardware calibration, but for me it has been superb -- certainly better, to my untrained eye, than the i1 Display Pro Plus's software calibration. That being said, I encountered a couple of bugs/problems when using the Palette Master software: it didn't detect my calibrator until I set colors to 10 bit, full output, and I had to plug it into a USB port on my desktop, not one of the SW321C's USB ports.<br/><br/>Update #3: The stuck pixel started to occur more frequently, so I contacted BenQ customer service and asked them to service the screen. The customer-support staff, who were phenomenal -- prompt, professional, understanding, knowledgeable, and incredibly to work with -- helped me, despite a couple of mix ups (which weren't their fault), resolve the matter to my satisfaction.<br/><br/>Update #4: The top review is... awful. What on earth sort of person brags(?) about bossing around delivery people? The top item in this person's list of pros is "high Quality Display Monitor," but the review also states that the screen was defective, that s/he has seen better image quality on $200 monitors, and that the colors look "horrible." Garbage. Neither of us is an expert. Ignore amazon reviews. Read reviews written by professional photographers, for whom this monitor is intended.</span>

<span>The PD3220U is ideal for digital work, as BenQ is notably silent on its Adobe RGB performance but boasts its P3 performance. It's also an improved monitor over the PD3200U. It may lack variable refresh rates making it not gaming-focused.  Outside that particular omission, it has just about everything else you'd want: puck adjuster for controls, USB3.1c, KVM switch, multiple inputs, ability to hot-swap color profiles, and even display profiles two at once.<br/><br/>It's relatively performant, besting the other displays at this size. The best comparison of the displays I tried was a Dell U3219Q when I purchased it was $850, but now it is roughly half the price. In pretty much every measurable way, the BenQ is a better display (sans perhaps cost-to-performance).<br/><br/>It works great my MacBook Pro and Mac Pro (although under 10.13.6 with an NVidia GPU, it was registering as a 6k display, whereas my AMD Vega 56 reported it correctly). The only real complaints are the viewing angle could be a hair wider, but at the size, this is always going to be the cause.  Color shift is pretty minimal. The finish can be mildly glare reflective in direct sunlight as its not a full matte. There's the smallest of edge shadow due to the ultra-thin bezel at the bottom edge, least pronounced of the four 32 inch 4k displays I've tried.  The black uniformity is the best I've ever seen in a 32-inch display, which is just flatly ok. When the monitor is totally dark, you can see a bit of unevenness. Also, there are no backlighting zones. It gets dark; it's not like my aging plasma screen's ability to produce deep blacks. As a daily driver, though, this is an excellent display and better than most. The wide gamut is especially felt when working with Adobe RGB profiled images and RAW photos. The P3 covers Rec BT 709 (very similar to sRGB) but lacks in the greens compared to Rec BT2020, which is well beyond any current displays sans very expensive high-end color grading displays.<br/><br/>Embracing P3 as the wide gamut standard, which covers roughly 45% of the colors the human eye can see (it's nowhere near Rec BT2020 covers 75%), is a good move as it is similar to Adobe RGB in colors covered. Basically, downloading test 10bit vs. 8bit footage is notable as gradient banding pretty much nonexistent whereas 8 bit footage you can see the banding.<br/><br/>I don't live or die by color accuracy, but it is nice when doing UI work.<br/><br/>There's also a few eye-strain technologies tossed in, do they work? Unsure doesn't seem to affect my eyes.  Also, the charging isn't quite enough for the 15 inch MacBook.<br/><br/>Lastly, the UI for a display is well above average. There are two quick profile color swaps, and brightness is super easy to adjust.<br/><br/>Pros:<br/>True 10 bit, not FRC.<br/>Wide color gamut and covers 96% of P3<br/>Easy to use UI and fast<br/>Multicolor profiles come included<br/>Didn't need to set up any color adjustments<br/>Despite the wide amount of features, sanely implemented<br/>Very low color shift.<br/>Fantastic pre-calibration.<br/>USB 3.1c<br/>More inputs than I'll ever need.<br/>Colorwise matches my MacBook 2017<br/><br/>The so-so:<br/>Matte isn't totally light sheeting.<br/>Viewing angles are pretty good but shy of smaller displays.<br/>Wattage is a bit low for 15 inch MacBooks running CPU intensive tasks, meaning still probably gotta use a power cable.<br/>GeForce 1060 thought the display was 6k under MacOS 10.13.6.<br/>No FRC, but MacOS doesn't support it.<br/>Slim bevels.<br/>Stand works nicely, no buttons or levels.<br/><br/>Bad:<br/>Backlighting could be more uniform<br/>Blacks look really good but still not as dark as my old plasma TV<br/>Somewhat pricey<br/>Internal speakers aren't any better than a Macbook's. Why bother?<br/><br/>Wishlist:<br/>I wish this was 5k or 6k; the size is fantastic.<br/>60+ Hz would be nice.<br/>Zoned backlighting for larger light/dark<br/><br/>/edit update:<br/><br/>Well covid hit and now this my main work display, and because of its input switching and ability to charge my laptop, has become even more valuable. I have a Thunderbolt 3 dock but this effectively eliminates the need. One cable connects me to my speakers, two displays and speakers, which are shared with my 2010 Mac Pro.</span>

<span>THE SHORT<br/>Good general everyday working monitor for anyone doing casual visual creative work where you need decent display quality with 4k capabilities. Love the sturdy build, easy-to-adjust height. Not the best in color accuracy (Delta E &lt; 3) and contrast/details in tonal ranges. Not the brightest monitor.<br/><br/>WHY I PURCHASED<br/>I am a full-time commercial photographer and filmmaker. Display quality and color accuracy are what I look for in my monitors. I purchased this monitor strictly for work to give me a larger screen when I edit vs. the 16" screen on my Macbook Pro.<br/><br/>DISPLAY INTEGRITY / COLOR<br/>- Contrast ratio on this monitor is decent at 1300:1, but not as high compared to the screen on my 16" macbook pro, which pushes a 1,000,000:1 for XDR content. Not docking points for this, but it is an important spec to note if you are expecting to use this as a main display for commercial visual creative work.<br/>- Not as bright as I'd like, coming in at 350 nits, compared to my macbook display which is 500 nits. Something to be aware of depending on the ambient lighting conditions of your work environment.<br/>- Color accuracy is rated at Delta E &lt; 3, which means color differences are perceptible at a glance. For professional creative work where color accuracy is a requirement, you're better off looking for a monitor with a Delta E value of &lt; 2 or lower.<br/><br/>BUILD QUALITY<br/>- The stand is sturdy and was super easy to setup; I was up and running within minutes of getting the monitor<br/>- Compared to the stand on one of my other monitors (LG 32QN600), this monitor does not wiggle and sits very stable on my desk<br/>- Height adjusts smoothly and securely, love this feature<br/>- I did notice that the corners of this screen appear to be peeling for some reason (see attached pictures). There was a sticker that came with the monitor when I unpacked it that said "DO NOT TEAR. It's normal for your monitor", which seems strange to me. I can't say that I've ever owned a monitor int he past that says a peeling adhesive in the corners is supposed to be normal. It has not proven to be an issue for now, as it is located in the black edge of the screen, though TBD whether it will continue to worsen over time.<br/><br/>PRICE<br/>- Honestly, it's a decently priced for the quality of this monitor. It's a good everyday work monitor for casual creative work, although I would not rely on it as my main display for any serious visual work.<br/><br/>VERDICT<br/>- Great purchase if you just need a mid-range 4k monitor with decent display integrity<br/>- Not the right move as your main display for any serious visual creative work, such as commercial photography or video editing, where you need to rely on higher quality display and better color accuracy</span>

<span>A quick word of advice to everyone who buys this monitor:  when you first hook it up to your computer, you will find that the screen (esp text, when scrolling) gets quite blurry and the colors might seem blotchy.  I was thinking that the monitor was defective when I saw it, but, after some homework, figured out that the problem is caused by faulty "overdrive" feature (or maybe not faulty?  never actually saw this feature before).  The control for "Overdrive" is under "System" and it's set to "medium" by default.  Turn it off.  Then the problem of blurry screen will go away and after that, the monitor is great.  (While I can't speak to the durability of this particular product, I've had generally excellent experience with Scepter monitors, all of which (I've had 4, including this one) were very durable over 3-4 years that I've used them.  At minimum, they products are worth it, IMHO.<br/><br/>*Original review below:<br/><br/>The short version is that the monitor is great (it is, fwiw, the most economical FHD monitor available), but some of the features don't seem to be working quite right.  One specific problem that came out right away was that the "Overdrive" feature is not working properly:  when you hook it up to your computer, you will find that objects on the monitor get blurry momentarily when you scroll.  After some searching, I found out that this is due to the overdrive feature that's supposed to speed up the response time...except, in this case, it's just making objects blurrier as they move with the mouse scroll.  The overdrive is set to "medium" in the factory setting.  You want to turn it off as the first thing you do.  After that, you should be happy.</span>

<span>I really needed a monitor to work from home and this had lots of good reviews and it was cheap - so I took a chance on it - and I am glad I did.  It really works well and I have had no problems with it at all.  The only annoying thing is that the on button is in the back - so I just end up leaving it turned on all the time.</span>

<span>I have two very old, inexpesive 18" monitors that have lasted a very long time, but one of them started flaking out when hooked up to my hub.  My office has much larger ones and thought this was a sign I should finally upgrade and get the same screen size at home as I do in the office.  But since my old monitors lasted a LONG time without paying a lot, I wanted to repeat that experience.  Lots of research and talking to other people led me to similar conclusion:  not a lot out there at a cheap price for larger sizes for people that just need a large working screen and not concerned about graphics and gaming.<br/>I had not heard of the Scepter brand before so I was a bit dubious.  But as I talked about my search with others, some programmers mentioned they HAD heard of them and were reputable.  They were about the best price and reviews largely good, so the programmer endorsement was what I needed to pull the trigger.<br/><br/>I'm very happy with these monitors!  Easy to set up.  Great resolution and color.  SO MUCH LIGHTER than my old ones.  I had to adjust the tension in my mounting arms accordingly.  I went with the standard, automatice calibration and haven't felt the need to fiddle with additional settings.  I'm an account/project manager that deals in spreadsheets, project management tools, Microsoft suite (Excel, Work, Outlook), and Adobe Creative Suite (Acrobat, Dreamweaver, Photoshop), and other custom tools for digital design, programming and management.<br/><br/>One thing I liked, and needed, is that the mounting screwholes on the back of the monitors are on the BOTTOM of the screen...rather than the middle or towards the top, which seems to be more standard.  This actually helped me get the monitors to the height I wanted with the mount I have without haveing to replace that too.  Works great for me, but might be a consideration for others, depending on how you plan to mount them.</span>

<span>I only use my desktop computer for writing, emailing, and basic Internet searches. I needed a monitor quickly since my old (7 year old) monitor died. This had good ratings and a great price. Easy set-up and it works great. Very thin which is a plus. Also it doesn't cause glare like my old monitor did.</span>

<span>This monitor is definitely a good value. Does it have superb color and contrast? No. Does it boast the best refresh rate on the market? No. But if you're tight on money, this thing looks and preforms great for the money. It has a Matte screen which does a great job at eliminating glare. The chassis it's enclosed within is absolutely stunning. It features a VGA and and HDMI port. The screen automatically detects signals and turns on when a source is turned on. When the selected source turns off it quickly scans and switches to any other sources. If no connections are available it goes into standby automatically. The power chord is a good 6 or more feet and easy to wrap with half of it being very thin wire. The ON LED is not distracting or too bright. When it's off it looks like a borderless monitor. And unlike what other people say it does have tilt, just not forward or left to right. It stands up straight or leans back. Unfortunately it doesn't have VESA mount holes, but under 100 you can't be that serious about your monitor setup. Small text has some problems fully rendering when using VGA so I recommend using HDMI. If you use the Windows 10 settings to configure how text is displayed though it fixes this, but not all will know how to do that. It doesn't have speaker, and I am thankful that most monitors don't. This monitor has A LOT of settings for gaming, night use, color adjustments, and general settings and all can be saved into 3 different gaming profiles. You can even change what settings appear in the quick menu. When u press any of the menu buttons, the menu pops up and clearly illustrates all the buttons. This monitors menus are super easy to understand and navigate and that's a rarity in its own. Also worth noting; it can display crosshairs and display the monitors current refresh rate. It also packs FreeSync for AMD graphics card users. If you only have DVI, you can get DVI to HDMI chords as long as your computer's video out supports it. The base and monitor couple together with one screw that features a hand flap so you don't need a screw diver if you don't want to use one. It is decently sturdy and the screen doesn't distort even when pressed on with strong pressure. The base is quite large, but wont be a problem for most. I haven't noticed any screen delay compared to my 300 dollar 1ms response time monitor (and I'm pretty picky). It's contrast is a little flat in some scenarios but appears much more dynamic in games, especially with some tweaking. With that said, I like that it looks flat when working on documents because it makes it much easier to focus.<br/><br/>All in all, this monitor is filled with a good balance of features and looks like a very solid 1080p 75Hz IPS screen for any monitor under $160, let alone the $80 I paid. If you don't absolutely need a better refresh rate and aren't planning on spending more than 200 dollars then I would say just buy this monitor. It's durable, feature packed, and looks fantastic in all use-case scenarios. I'd give it 1000 stars if I could.</span>

<span>Monitor performance once I got to work is fine.  Not a superb monitor from a quality perspective, but I think it offers a great value for the price you pay.  I am not a gamer or a programmer, but I do stare at the monitor 10-11 hours a day for my job, so having a large screen helps.  Having a slight curves monitor also adds a nice aesthetic to the office.  The picture quality and the crispness of the fonts are fine for office work, and I have no complaints.<br/><br/>Right out of the box, the monitor failed to work properly.  As soon as I booted up my work laptop and logged in to the network, a screeching sound (like a high pitch squealing noise at different tones) and a random popping noise came through the monitor speaker as the screen went blank.  The on/off buttons in the back failed to respond, and I ended up unplugging the monitor from the power and disconnected the HDMI cable.  I plugged back in the cable after a few minutes and tried again, and this time instead of the screeching sound and the popping noise, the monitor started switching color swatches - red to green to blue to white to black and repeat.  Once again, none of the buttons worked, so I had to unplug the power and the HDMI.  I tested the HDMI cable, and it works fine.  I tried again, and this time, it worked.  I was able to set up the monitor as desired, and I had no issues.  I am not sure what happened at the start, but the monitor is now functioning as expected.</span>

<span>I decided to include this monitor in my first official desktop setup because it was curved. At first, I was kinda unsure on whether I was going to like it or not, but looking at it right now, it's really good! Beats my expectations. I haven't calibrated the display yet, so it's looking a bit too cool color wise, but I'm very sure I can fix that. Setting this monitor up was pretty easy, a few screws and they give you a magnetic screwdriver so you don't lose anything. So far, it's working well! I did take a star off because the speaker was that bad. Normally something like speaker quality wouldn't bother me since I'm not an audiophile, but the sound coming from this was sooooo tinny, it's worse than the dollar store headphones. If you're planning on getting it, do yourself a favor and buy some cheap amazon basics speakers. I had to bust out the wireless speaker I had on hand. Otherwise, buy it! Just don't expect quality sound with it.</span>

<span>Fantastic color accurate field monitor great for professional photographers. I am a professional photographer and digitech and this has been a great monitor for client viewing on location as well as a great second monitor when working remotely on just your laptop. Great one cable solution if you are using usbC/thunderbolt 3 or 4. Stunning color accuracy and being 1080p is actually a big asset in the field as it is far less taxing on your laptop's GPU. Resulting is faster rendering of preview images. One of my favorite features is the 1/4 20 socket on the bottom. Perfect for mounting on a tripod, light stand or magic arm. My only complaints are no sunsheild/glare gard, but you can make or buy one. However, as it has a really good matte screen glare is not much of an issue. It's really just brightness in direct sun, which really you can still see it, it just would be better with a sun shield. My only other complaint is that the touch screen only functions on a pc. No touch support for Mac. I suspect this is mostly to due with apple not Asus but I'm not sure. It would be great to have touch support for Mac and also camera but i suspect that's impossible. That brings me to the last really cool thing, you can plug it directly into the camera's hdmi out to get a live view while shooting stills or video to card. And it works great with one exception... It only supports 8 bit HDMI which means if you use it as a video monitor directly attached to the camera you can't shoot in 10 bit only 8bit at least with my cameras. That hurts. In conclusion you won't find a more color accurate field monitor with a 1/4 20 thread mount for this price. I have 3 Asus pro art monitors that run my business. A 4k 32" a 2k 24" and now this 1080p 14" I 100% trust the color accuracy and brightness of these monitors and I stake my reputation and business on them everyday.</span>

<span>So I’m not using this in a way that most other users seem to be….but that’s okay. I will be using this as my secondary computer monitor with hdmi for art projects….but what I really wanted was another smaller monitor to hook up to my old Samsung note 9 with the usb-c port cable. Straight talk made me upgrade to a 5g capable phone so this has now become my “tv” phone. I live out in the country with horrible internet and we will not be getting it upgraded any time soon (not our choice). Since I cannot use this phone as a backup cellular device anymore, I am still able to pre-download things from YouTube, Disney plus, Netflix…whatever is available when I am at a place with decent wifi …and then just watch them offline at home. I have a larger Samsung smart monitor that this works on, but when I’m gaming I like having another screen with something else going on for background noise. I was a little worried this wouldn’t work with my older phone but it works great! I do have hdmi adapters that do…work…but the video and audio doesn’t always want to sync up and this helps eliminate that extra cord. I could have purchased another type of display for this purpose but I wanted it as an actual computer monitor too. Two birds with one stone for me! I love that it’s easily rotatable and height adjustable as well since the ceilings in my room are very a frame and not everything always fits. It feels really solid and well built. This monitor is much easier on my eyes then the one I was using. So far so good! I’m really glad I went with this one.</span>

<span>I wanted to write this and let everyone know that these monitors really are very good.  They come with all the cabling you will need and are very adjustable.  I bought them for the PhotoShop work that I do and wanted something that was color calibrated, which I'm sure they are.  However, I was under the impression that the monitors would come with software that would allow you to recalibrate the colors.  They DO NOT come with this.  I have created an account on the ASUS website and registered both of them, and went to the downloads section of this model and other models of the ProArt display... it's NOT there.  I have also put in a chat support ticket with one of their reps.  I was told basically to go buy a 3rd party calibration tool.  I already have a Spyder, but I picked these up because I thought they had their own calibration software either built-in or downloadable.  This is not the case.<br/><br/>You can even Google around and find articles that show you how and where to download these tools, those pages are gone.<br/><br/>If I am wrong, I hope an ASUS rep reaches out to me and shows me where to get their software.</span>

<span>I’m very pleased so far with this monitor. It’s crisp and clear, with good color. I might tweak the color settings down the road when I get more familiar with its tendencies, but so far it’s fine. I’m not a gamer or video editor so I can’t speak to those functions.<br/><br/>What I really liked about this was the small bezel and easy height adjustment. Plus, the base isn’t some weird shaped design that tries way too hard. I have various things that hang out around the monitor base, and because this base is simple and flat it’s very practical.<br/><br/>As many others have said, the built in speakers are a joke. Is this 1991? My Apple Watch has a better speaker. They are only good for a bleep or bloop you might need your pc to make. I don’t expect Atmos Dolby 5.1, but I guess I’m still stuck with external speakers taking up desk space.<br/><br/>All in all though, these are really nice monitors.</span>
