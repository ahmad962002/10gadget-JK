<blockquote><em><div class="a-row a-spacing-small review-data"><span class="a-size-base review-text review-text-content" data-hook="review-body">
<span>Received ours Monday, 02-13-17.  Printer arrived on time and in good condition.  This was an upgrade from the 100 model for us.  We have a salesman that uses it in the field with no wifi access.  There was some irritation on my part initially.  I assumed the 200 would also have Bluetooth access but it does not.  The specs didn't list it (my bad), but a lot of the reviews said it did (and still do).  Don't despair!  The unit offers a Wi-Fi Direct option during the setup.  The printer gets assigned it's own Wi-Fi Network/Name.  Don't know how it works and don't care so please, no mansplaining.  But it works great.  It has been our experience, that you have to select the printer wifi connection each time you boot up.  His Android device will revert back to any other wifi connections available, but will not find that one on it's own.  This is absolutely a non-issue for us and I didn't subtract any stars because of it.  I subtracted the star because of the S/N - Product # Label.  While I was able to set it up and make a connection almost immediately, printing from the Android device resulted in an all black page.  I don't mean only black, no color.  I mean an 8.5 x 11 page filled entirely with black ink.  Tried to do the HP Support thing online, but couldn't finish the form because I didn't know the S/N (the box was in another location).  Could not find the S/N anywhere on the unit.  Tried several work arounds for Tech Support and finally got through to someone in Sales ( because by Golly, there's a direct number for that!) who told me  - Listen carefully, I'm about to drop some knowledge on you - that the recorded voice will tell you to visit the web page, pause, tell you to visit the web page again, pause, and THEN connect you to someone in Tech Support.  Kris in Tech Support was great.  But he didn't know where my S/N was either.  I ended up removing any ePrint or Printsharing apps on the Android Device then removing and re-installing the Wi-Fi Direct on the printer.  Worked great.  But back to missing S/N bar code.  I was going through the customer questions and comments telling anyone who cared that this is NOT A BLUETOOTH printer and lo and behold, I see a picture of S/N barcode on someone's printer.  Looks to me like you have to take the battery cover off.  My salesman already has it in the field, so I haven't confirmed it yet.  Poor, poor design - thus minus one star.</span>

<span>I own a business and I use this on the road with Wi-Fi direct . Great for printing invoices for my customers. It’s small enough to travel and holds a great battery life. I charge it up usually once or twice a week</span>

<span>Really needed and appreciated the easy setup feature as I was printing last-minute documents and figured a portable would be the easiest to set up. Still works fine, and prints quickly; the print quality was fine, the documents looked as they should, clean and professional, including the colored areas. I also chose this one for its small footprint/neat and clean look on my office desk, and I don't print daily. Portability may prove handy, I traveled with one in the past for business document privacy concerns.</span>

Once I got it set up the printer wasn’t printing correctly I’ve googled every video possible and still yet to find the solution. 3.

<span>I bought this for a new WFH job, and needed a minimal, no frills printers. I received it from the seller within a few days and set up was breezy. No issues, and printing was easy. By the 2nd day, it had stopped printing. The connection was okay, but it was printing blank pages and no amount of troubleshooting fixed it. I turned on and off, uninstalled and reinstalled the drivers, cleaned, adjusted bought new ink and nada. I'm beyond frustrated that a $300 printer would stop working within a day.<br/><br/>Update: after not being able to find an affordable printer to replace this one, I decided to give this one more go. I adjusted the printer head, and repeatedly cleaned it and it finally started to print normally. I've come to believe we get starter ink so we can waste it adjusting the printer head and cleaning the nozzle. Life lesson: persevere and your printer will print.</span>

<span>This printer works great as a home printer, or on-the-go.  At home, I set it up on my home WiFi and my whole family can use it.  In my truck, I use the printer’s Wireless Direct feature, which is essentially that the printer broadcasts a WiFi signal (in place of my router) and I connect my phone or tablet (or laptop) to THAT wireless signal.  The pages print FAST, even the ones with photos embedded.  I loaded about 20 sheets of paper in the chute and had no issues.  I don’t know what the max is that it can hold.  My Contract paperwork is only 6 pages long, so 12 pages is all I need to load at one time, anyway.  But I really love that I can print my estimates immediately from a customer’s kitchen table, or even in the truck if I never go inside their home — or even in the middle of their backyard if I had the battery.<br/><br/>I don’t need a battery because my truck has an electric outlet that I can plug the printer into.  A USB-A to USB-C cable is provided presumably to hardwire connect a laptop to the printer, but I found nothing in the printer’s paperwork that tells me this.  I work strictly from iPhone/iPad anyway, so I have no need for this cable.<br/><br/>I bought the carrying case also (co2crea Hard Travel Case) and the printer fits nicely with room for the power supply, paper and spare ink cartridges.<br/><br/>I was hoping that the printer could be powered through the USB-C port by a portable recharging battery so that I wouldn’t have to buy the Canon proprietary battery, but this doesn’t work.  But like I said, as long as my truck is nearby, I can always plug the power supply in there or anywhere there is a working electrical outlet and then I won’t need a battery.<br/><br/>Setup was a bit involved setting up both home WiFi and on-the-go WiFi (Wireless Direct) on the printer and both my iPhone and iPad, but didn’t take more than 15 minutes.  I *did* need to power off the printer and back on again for the wireless to connect.  If printing from an app, just select the printer, whether on your home WiFi or Wireless Direct, like always.  If you are printing files from the file system (i.e., not from within an app), you need to use the free Canon SELPHY app to choose the document and send it to the printer.  I have noticed a bug with this approach, though.  I was printing out a release form that I e-mailed a customer who signed it electronically (via PDF markup) and even though the signatures showed up on the print preview, the signatures didn’t print but the rest of the form did, including embedded photos!  It was like the signatures were in invisible ink!  I don’t know if this is a bug in the SELPHY software or the printer itself.  Hopefully, I won’t run into more issues like that.  But overall, I’m very happy with my purchase!</span>

<span>My HP 3 in 1 printer that I bought a long time ago finally died. So first and foremost HP products are awesome. The printer I had before which had the copy and the scanner I actually bought it at Costco and I'm going to say I had that machine for 10 years.<br/><br/>So when that one died I saw this one on Amazon and noticed the price had come down and I had to have something so low and behold I bought it. It's a nice little machine they have a program where you can buy ink for the machine at a discount rate if you join this club thing I think it's for 6 months. For me it just really wasn't worth it I would just rather buy the ink on my own. But it may work for you. I like to get the remanufacturing. And there's a couple of places that I buy it through online. I actually haven't checked here on Amazon but I will do that.<br/><br/>The scanning feature works perfectly I have no complaints. The copy feature works like a charm! And it folds up nice and neat. You pull out a little flap and it has a paper guide from when your item is done printing or copying and then it folds nicely back up. She don't have any flap sticking out that will break or anything like that it's nice it's perfect compact I love it. Also the other thing that I like about this machine is that instead of the paper being fed from the front there's actually a paper guide so you can only put in so many sheets of paper which prevents it from getting stuck into the roller. So if anyone has any doubts I would say go ahead and get this it comes quickly it's pretty easy to figure out. I highly recommend this.</span>

<span>It prints so it's fine. I don't like it as much as my old one so I'm a little bitter. But the old did randomly die so maybe it's not that great. The paper tray is smaller so I have to reload more often. The screen/button area isn't super user friendly or intuitive.<br/><br/>You have to set-up through the app or a computer. They recommend the app, I hate having to download an app for set-up but it does work much better. Set-up was fine, pretty straightforward. If you have any issues/problems with the printer you solve them through the app or a computer it seems. The printer itself isn't much help. My printer randomly was having issues connecting to the wi-fi. I had to re-download the app after trying on a computer to fix it. I tried for like an hour and was about to return it (2 days left to return) when I tried one last thing - restarting my router. It worked. It's frustrating but I guess now I know. None of my other devices had issues so it's weird.<br/><br/>The print quality is fine, I've only done paper though. Double sided printing is annoying. You print the first side then turn the paper and put it back in so it can print the second side. Instructions pop up on my screen whenever I choose this option. However, if you already have more paper in the tray it'll automatically print on a second sheet. So you have to take all the paper out before printing double sided.<br/><br/>I keep getting errors when I print, it'll flash E 2 or something. Everything prints fine so I don't understand why it's giving me an error message.<br/><br/>I signed up for Instant Ink since it was free. Everyone recommends keeping it. It is super convenient to not have to think about ordering it. It just gets sent to your house automatically. You'll have to remember to cancel if you don't want to pay for it since you have to put payment info to get started. Starts at $1 a month, next tier is $4/month.<br/><br/>Overall, it's fine. It's relatively affordable and gets the job done. My old printer worked so much better and had better features for a similar price. Of course the new model is a lot more expensive so I opted for this one.</span>

<span>Overall, I am happy with the printer but the reason I couldn't give 5 stars is the install instruction was not good enough and gave me hard time until I was able to print/scan.  The good news is the technical support is helpful (I called technical support twice and eventually the problem was solved).  Otherwise, the printer quality and printing speed is ok for the price.</span>

<span>First off, READ THE DESCRIPTION! Don’t give the printer a bad rating because you couldn’t be bothered to read the information provided.<br/>  Is it a scanner? NO and it doesn’t say so. Is it wireless? NO and it doesn’t say so. It says its USB. Is there a cable? No and there is actually a list literally called “What’s in the box” to tell you so! You can use your old cable, they’re all the same.<br/>How long does the ink last? Really??? That’s like saying how long does a gallon of gas last! It depends on how you use it!<br/>  C’mon people, its 2022. Every new printer has come with “starter” cartridges since before the millennium! This comes with #s 243 &amp; 244 included. Available cartridges numbers 245 &amp; 246 are “standard” and 245xl &amp; 246xl are high capacity. And I don’t know how long they last either!<br/><br/>  I found the printer easy to set up. Not quick, necessarily, but pretty straight forward. There is an instruction sheet that actually has English on it so that’s a plus. I installed it on a laptop, with a disc drive, running windows 7. Easy peasy. Some downloads and test prints took some time so it all probably took 45 minutes but a lot of that was waiting for the programs to do their thing.<br/>  I only gave it a 3 star rating because the printable area is pretty bad. The unusable margins, top, bottom and sides, are pretty big. So big, that the one thing I bought it for, printing ebay labels, it doesn’t do properly. It cuts off the left edge to point that there is only one digit left showing in my return address. (I have to download the label, and print it using software that allows me to move it over on the page.) To me, that’s a big negative.<br/>  Yes, it will do borderless but not on plain paper. Thanks for nothing.<br/>  While trying to see if there was a way to improve all this, I navigated around in the software. A little awkward to say the least. If you want to stop the huge short cut collection from showing up on start up, you have to find the Quick Menu, then locate the little screwdriver and pliers icon -NOT the settings icon- and that will give you the option to not see it on startup.<br/>  I have not used it for color or photos yet. If that’s important to you, I suggest you spend more than fifty bucks! Even at that price, its not worth returning, I’ll deal with it, but had I known how bad the printable area was, I would have shopped more.<br/>***update*** After a month or so, either I accidentally clicked something or there was a software update. I can now print ebay labels but its not straight forward. I have to choose my options EVERY time. But at least the menu includes "print to usable area" or something like that. Which is kinda dumb. Seems to me that would be the norm. BUT you have to tell it to do it on a quarter sheet otherwise you get an 8 x 11 label!!! Basically, my old printer printed a label as you  would expect, normally and completely. This takes a lot of clicking boxes and it still comes out smaller. And since I can only play with the settings when I sell something, its a slow learning curve.***</span>

<span>This is a nice printer if you want casual use around home. It will never be what you need for regular printing, but is great when used within the proper parameters. The black and white print is FAST while color prints, which are beautiful, take about what you'd expect a standard printer.<br/><br/>The one thing I have to complain about is just how loud it is. It's unncessary for what I'd expect from Canon. I had a Canon PIXMA MG 2220 before this and it was sturdy and very efficient, lasted 9.5 years and wouldn't wake a baby. This one just might.</span>

<span>EDIT: 092122:<br/>First time I tried to print something since July, where it took over an hour to get it to print.<br/>AND GUESS WHAT?  PRINTER NOT ONLINE AGAIN!!!  NEITHER DEVICE (Air print my a. )..<br/>I’ve already killed 10-min rebooting and power cycling devices and printer, then trying to print again from both devices..<br/>SAME!!! (As back in July when it took me over an hour to print some thing), I find myself contemplating chucking this thing in the garbage.<br/><br/>Knocked off another star, and I’m very comfortable now with 1-star being where it belongs..<br/><br/>Because with todays technology the darn thing should stay connected, or at least connect back up without an hour of troubleshooting..  I don’t care if it’s my 5G router front-mobile, or whatever..  “because” other devices like my (Roku) for example is always connected (at least 98% of the time..  and e]when it’s not a power cycle and it’s working again).<br/><br/>Again, if I really needed to print something, it would be quicker driving to the Kinko’s that is 25 min away (50-min round trip)..<br/>Totally worthless to casually print a shopping list for example..  I’ve gotten in the habit of not even bothering (because I expect it not to print).<br/>This is unacceptable..<br/><br/>[older edit]:<br/>Hovering b/t 1-2 stars..  2-stars because people more likely to read..  There is no reason it needs to be this hard to print something..  Because my phone and iPad always connect to my internet router..  so does my (Roku)..  Same for my old router (phone &amp; (Roku) and oaf all 3, connected permanently and never forgot their connections)..  My work laptop connected to the router no problem..  Wi-Fi printing should be settled technology by now..  This printer was advertised to work with apple (AirPrint), so what’s the problem?  I give up..  If it continues to be a PITA; I’ll eat the $150..  it’s going in the trash..<br/><br/>EDIT: 070422:<br/>SAME OLD SAME OLD..<br/>Over an hour to print today (last time 3H troubleshooting)..<br/>GOOGLE Always has the same list of things to check and recheck over &amp; over again until the COWS come home (same WIFI, not in airplane mode, etc).<br/><br/>Now neither my phone or pad can see the printer.  I power cycled pad, phone and printer.. no change.. I went in and made sure IPV6 was set to no (no change).  I hope I’m not in for another 3-HOURS of troubleshooting like last time.  I guess I’ll try typing in the darn Wi-Fi password again on the printer (THAT TAKES 20-MINUTES at least .. because it’s a four word password.. and I only gave devices.. cannot plug in a laptop).<br/><br/>Confirmed, the darn printer forgot the damn Wi-Fi password again (same as it did two days ago)..  It’s a P.I.T.A! to type in that long Wi-Fi password with two buttons (I think it forgot the password because the field was blank, and after I typed it in again, it connected to the router immediately).  EDIT: I think I entered the password again because the interface made me believe there was no password (if the green light is not flashing, I now believe it’s connected)<br/><br/>NOW COMPLETELY DIFFERENT TROUBLE (from last time);<br/>Now neither phone nor pad can see the printer..<br/>If they can’t make a printer that works wirelessly, you think there would be a port so you could run a darn USB cable across the floor or something..<br/><br/>Also I’ve been getting the low toner message, and I barely used the printer (I doubt I’ve printed 200 pages of normal text).  Screw this, I’m about ready to chuck this thing in the garbage and buy some other printer (before sinking more money into this thing).<br/><br/>Who the hell has time to troubleshoot a printer every time you want to print a recipe or a grocery list?<br/><br/>EDIT: 070222:<br/>3-HOURS TROUBLESHOOTING; turned ipv6 off (on the printer), and then could print from iPAD (phone was apparently working the whole time)..  I listed to an expert somewhere in the comments to turn ipv6 on to stop the deep sleep (and forgetting the wifi password), but now I’m not sure this was ever a problem to begin with..  Verified for HL-L2350DW, turned off ipv6 on the printer and iPAD printing started working immediately..<br/><br/>EDIT: (same day):<br/><br/>Changed from 1 to 3-stars (because I don’t know what the trouble is).<br/>When I looked at the printer it remembered the Wi-Fi name, but the password field was blank..<br/>It took 20-min to type in that 4-word Wi-Fi password (with the two buttons)..  And it connected immediately.<br/>So PROBLEM; forgets that long password..<br/><br/>But I just now figured out it prints from iPhone, but not iPad (both are new models up to date software).<br/>So maybe it’s apple screwing he instead of brother (2H of my life this session I’ll never get back)..<br/><br/>So I bumped it up to three stars..<br/><br/>[original]:<br/>A PRINTER HAS ONE JOB (1-star)!<br/>It always takes AN HOUR OF SCREWING AROUND to get it to print anything..<br/>It would be quicker to drive to kinkos..<br/><br/>Why am I blaming the printer?<br/>Because I see amazon reviewers with the same problem, and I see hundreds of people with the same problem in apple help communities ie: “I have this problem too” button)..<br/><br/>When I do finally get it to work it’s a mystery how it got fixed..<br/>So every time takes the better part of an hour (and sometimes I just give up trying)..<br/>It would be easier to write my grocery list by hand..<br/><br/>Darn thing is always offline, and defies all attempts to get it online again..<br/>If it were only a one time setup I’d get over it, but after a few months a “CLEAR” pattern has formed;<br/><br/>I’m using apple devices (AirPrint), and successfully connected the printer to both my old router, and my new router.. I suspect the problem is it drops its Wi-Fi connection to my router, but that’s the last thing I want to mess with because It’s NOT a joy to stand there 30+ minutes using two buttons to enter those long network passwords..<br/><br/>I dread screwing with the dreaded two buttons again, but I believe this is what it needs...<br/>It takes so damn long to type in the passwords I can’t bend over that long because I’ve had back surgery<br/>(seriously thinking about chucking this POS in the garbage)..<br/>It makes it worse I have to use a flashlight and a magnifying glass the see the super tiny LCD screen..<br/><br/>It’s 3am,<br/>I’ve got my flashlight, and I’m off now to screw with the two printer buttons again (that I’ve become much more familiar with than I wanted)..<br/>Grrrrr.</span>

<span>The reviews and Q &amp; A's are conflicting as to whether this printer is compatible with computers running Linux. The truth is: yes, it is. But not in a way many people are used to. I struggled with this too. There are no native device drivers for this printer, for Linux. But like most popular modern printers, you can print from your phone on this printer, which means it supports Internet Printing Protocol (IPP). IPP and AirPrint are protocols understood by the Common Unix Printing System (CUPS). So it will work but it may require some extra setup on your part. Especially if you are trying to set it up while not connected via USB. I have not tested the printer over USB, but I suggest you do that first if possible before taking any of my advice. Your Linux distribution might be able to detect and setup the printer automatically over USB. If not, or if you need to set-up over WiFi, here is the process I followed on Manjaro, specifics on your distro might be different.<br/><br/>1. If you have already been messing around with many settings. Use the printer's display and buttons to find the reset function to reset everything on the printer to factory defaults. It's under: initial setup &gt; reset &gt; machine reset.<br/>2. Start up the printer and connect it to your WiFi by following the included instructions.<br/>3. Access your router's admin portal, find the IP address of the printer and write it down. You should make it static as well. Otherwise the printer's local IP address might change in the future.<br/>4. Now enter the printer's IP into your browser, which will bring up a remote management portal.<br/>5. At the top, there is a login button with a text input box. Enter the password found on the sticker on the back of your printer and login.<br/>6. Go to the network tab.<br/>7. click "protocol" on the left-hand menu.<br/>8. Make sure "IPP" is checked.<br/>9. CUPS is probably already installed on your system. But just to be sure use your package manager to make sure you have CUPS installed, as well as the web interface. On Manjaoro, the package called "manjaro-printer" will download all the necessary stuff. I believe it is installed by default. Either way, you're looking for a package called CUPS, manage printing, CUPS web interface, or something similar.<br/>10. Now that CUPS is installed enter this URL in your web browser: http://localhost:631<br/>11. If you installed the right package, this should take you to a web page where you manage CUPS. At the top of the page, click "administration"<br/>12. Click "add printer".<br/>13. In the list on the next page, select "internet printing protocol (IPP)" and continue.<br/>14. For connection, enter "ipp://&lt;printer-ip-address&gt;:631" and continue. Replace "&lt;printer-ip-address&gt;" with an actual IP address...<br/>15. Add a name, description and location for the printer and continue. This information isn't critical. It will show up in print dialog boxes.<br/>16. Select "Brother" from the list of makes and continue.<br/>17. For model select "IPP Everywhere" (lol) and click "add printer".<br/>18. The next page has something to do with "banners". I have no idea what it is, doesn't seem important. Click "set default options".<br/><br/>That's it, the printer should be ready to use now. To print a test page:<br/><br/>1. Click "printers" in the menu at the top of the page.<br/>2. Click on the Brother printer you just finished setting up<br/>3. In the "maintenance" drop-down menu, select "print test page".<br/><br/>If everything worked out, you should see a new print job appear at the bottom of the screen and a few moments later the printer should whirr to life and spit out the test page. I hope this helped!</span>

<span>This thing uses up an entire ink cartridge every time I have a small project. It’s ridiculous. I could only print 8 full page photos on one set of cartridges. I tried printing out games for my baby shower and had to order more ink just so I could finish. Whether it’s color or black it goes through ink in one session. Not worth the buy. My old printer was half the price, did more and I rarely had to purchase ink.

<span>Addendum 29 November 2020 (purchased in February 2020).  The first several months with this printer were serendipity, printed great, but I only needed it a couple times a month.  HP sent a spare set of ink cartridges early on as my first refill under its Instant Ink program.<br/><br/>Went to print after a couple months of non-use in October 2020, photo colors were washed out and striped, like the heads had lost all control (more on this in Addendum at bottom).  After several attempts to remedy it, printing test pages that all counted toward my Instant Ink quota, I gave up and installed the new ink cartridges, all was good again.  Now, a month after that, went to print a letter with photos, back to the same problem.<br/><br/>This printer unfortunately is no longer worth the pain and suffering to work through it.  It was great at first, but then it let me down, bigly.  My guess, someone who uses it regularly would have better results, as others reported the inkjet heads dry up if not used often.<br/><br/>And a word about the Instant Ink Program.  A reason for having this small compact printer is the ability to stow it away when not in use.  However, HP sent frequent reminders to plug it in and get it on line so it could report on the 0 pages it was printing.  I tried to do so for a day here and there to suit them, but the communications got more aggressive.  Plus...the program of free monthly quotas up to 15 pages now has a nominal charge.  And more, once I sent in the old inkjet cartridges I was hoping for HP to send replacements.  Did not happen, apparently I have to print their target threshold of pages, which isn't going to happen with bad printing issues.<br/><br/>Summing up, I had high hopes for this for my minimal use, but those hopes were for naught.<br/><br/>If you are a potential buyer, here's some longer term experience, but if you are a frequent user, I encourage you to read below at what I found out of the box after a couple weeks of use.  It's not all bad, just didn't work for me.<br/>-------------------<br/>My 8 year old HP OfficeJet 6700 finally gave up the fight —  would not load paper.  It was originally purchased to print from iPhones and iPads, but gave way to a mono LaserJet Pro M227fdw, which is a workhorse (if you want a reliable mid-level all-in-one).  Both excell(ed) at duplexing, which was a main requirement for my printing at the time each was purchased.  As I defaulted to the LaserJet, I used the 6700 for color printing only, which was done in spurts, probably not averaging more than 10 pages a month, plus expensive cartridge replacement.<br/><br/>Once I lost the color printer, I did an exhaustive, paralyzing search for a replacement, since the need was essentially just for simple color printing.  The DeskJet 3755 was attractive in compactness, style/color, and price, but came with so many negative comments on multiple facets and no duplexing.  Yet, no matter what I looked at in the less-than $200 variety, everything had similar faults, almost as if the same group of reviewers wrote the same reviews for every HP, Epson, Brother, and Canon printer out there.<br/><br/>I eventually decided a $50 cost was worth the risk, even with reported slow performance, scanning issues, connectivity issues, and an ink-guzzler.  I was also turned off by the reported “must provide credit card to set up” reports.  No, you don’t, I did without it.  But I later provided a credit card to join the HP Instant Ink program, which once you do the math, is a no-brainer at low volume…or actually any volume, with the flexibility to change or back out at any time.<br/><br/>After a week or so, I can report it is not slow (in general) at normal quality, and the print is crisp, even with photos embedded in documents.  Scans are crooked if you put them in loosely, as opposed to square against the right-side guide, and then the scan is as you would expect a proper scan to appear.  No, it doesn't have a flatbed to scan books, ID cards, etc.  I don’t care that you can only feed one page at at time, since I’m using my LaserJet for scanning.  If you are copying voluminous ledgers or reports, anything other than loose pages, don’t buy this all-in-one.  I have not and don’t intend to do color nor B&amp;W copying, so maybe folks are right that it’s not great on this printer, though with a little patience, it probably isn’t that bad as reported.<br/><br/>As for connectivity issues on initial setup, I was prepared for a mess, but was delighted by the simplicity, which I accomplished while on eternal hold with another company needing customer support; you could call it “distracted setup.”  Perhaps the confusion for some users comes in the variety of ways HP offers for setup…through a downloaded mobile platform app, direct cable, or internet connection to your main computer, in my case a Mac OS.  I opted for the mobile platform app.  It was not always intuitive, but with few little hiccups, it connected well.  I would offer to be sure your main computer downloads needed drivers, and once I did, I had no problems.  I didn’t realize that until I went to the downloaded app for my Mac, that drivers still needed to be loaded, which took less than 5 seconds to do.<br/><br/>For the record, those reporting they had to print 11 or more pages in setup...you pushed too many buttons that can give you status, etc, but really didn't need to be printed with setup.  With initial setup I only printed three pages, one being the print alignment tool, which was optional (it was pretty much okay without doing that).<br/><br/>I can only surmise that those reporting connection problems either had a network system that was tweaked for their purposes beyond normal configurations, leading to compatibility issues at first attempt to connect to this printer, or they possibly tried to mix steps of the options for setup if they encountered what might have seemed like non-response, in which case I discovered give it time.  There are occasional blank screens that don’t show loading/setup action, which was working in the background.  That’s one thing HP could fix.<br/><br/>What actually scared me were reviews of poorly printed text, photos, and the like.  As one or more reviewers have noted, that is likely a firmware problem. So upon initial setup I checked the firmware status and confirmed the latest was installed, likely when first connecting and registering.  And as mentioned, there are a couple tools in the app to help you fix that.  That said, there are no issues so far with print quality — text nor photos.  It is what I was expecting, and surprisingly, not much different from the good old OfficeJet 6700, Rest In Peace.<br/><br/>So I have a printer that I expect to meet my low-demand color print needs as well as ink resupply, that will hopefully be delivered without asking, just-in-time at low or no-cost.  I decided I really don’t need auto-duplexing, I can just turn the page over to print the flip side, and I love the compact size and color styling.  If it starts to let me down I will amend this review, but for now, 5-stars for a $50 unit, with pleasure!<br/><br/>Addendum October 18, 2020:  One thing another reviewer pointed out, that the inkjet heads dry out or clog up from dust over time, or a variation of that, just happened.  After 8 months of very low level use, I went to print a color photo that at first printed normally but too small, resized it, reprinted, and the colors where very much washed out, almost negative-looking.  Cartridge ink levels looked to be more than half on the HP app.  I did a couple routine troubleshooting attempts like reducing pixel count, realignment test, and the like, but no change.  I removed the inkjet cartridges, wiped the excess ink from them, and tried again, no change.  So I installed the new jets the HP program had sent upon signup and everything again worked fine.  I returned the old cartridges in the prepaid envelope from the ink program.  Hopefully HP will send replacements automatically as they did before.  But the foot-stomper here is use it more often than I have been and you should be A-OK.  Still 5-stars!</span>

<span>I just finished setting up the printer so far, so good. It took less than 5 minutes to connect to wireless.  The print quality is good and the compact size of the printer is exactly what I was looking for. I don’t do a ton of printing so it’s perfect for what I need. So far I’ve printed from my iPhone and iPad with absolutely no problems. I haven’t tried printing from my MacBook yet because I’m too lazy to go it right now but if there are any problems I’ll update. If you are looking for an inexpensive, compact printer for basic printing go ahead and get this one.</span>

<span>I'm a IT and took over an hour to get this printer working.<br/><br/>**Even following the instructions on the manual didn't include the piece of orange plastic that you had to take out that was inside the printer to get the toner to read** - Key information for people having problems with this printer. (Take out the toner first, and then there should be a orange plastic there that blocks it from reading).<br/><br/>I had to connect the USB to the back of my desktop in order for it to read correctly and the supplied USB cable is hilariously too short, so make sure you use a (high quality) USB extender that will carry enough power and won't corrupt the data signal (like those china ones).<br/><br/>You won't need the CD nor will you need download the drivers if you have internet connection (Im using Windows 10, but Windows 7 and up has automatic driver downloads as soon as you plug in the USB). Don't change any print settings on the driver cause this seem to make the printer upset too. But you can test and see what works out. If the printer starts acting up cause you change the settings on the driver you can use device manager to uninstall it and reinstall a fresh one that is unmodified.<br/><br/>Last but not least...the wireless printing doesn't work. Like at all. I follow the instructions on the official Canon website and use the  Network_Setting_Tool in the official driver package to enable wireless and connect to my WPS (as well as manual connect). No dice. Printer just don't wanna connect to wireless. So forget about any AirPrinting what so ever, its not gonna do it.<br/><br/>Best thing about this printer is that it was apparently on sale for $99 and it used toner (toner does not dry out like those silly ink cartridge's which WILL if you don't use it all up fast enough, which most home user don't). It also printers extremely fast, a whole page comes smoothly through the motor without delay, I would guess about 1 page per ~1.50s but don't quote me on that I didn't use a timer.<br/><br/>And my main reason for buying, it has aftermarket toners that is 1/3 the price when you do have to replace it which will bring down the operational cost drastically (again toners don't dry out!). I got a toner printer because I don't print enough, so that might not even matter anyway. I just don't want my ink drying out like every other ink cartridge printer I had.<br/><br/>With all that said, at the time of purchase there was a toner printer that was slightly cheaper and I would have gotten that instead knowing the difficulties I had with this printer. I bought it because it was Canon, but this one is definitely one of the jankier ones.</span>

We are sharing this wirelessly from both a Windows based PC as well as Apple iMac,</span>

<span>I rarely need to print these days. I have a nice color laser copier/printer in storage that I can haul out as needed. But it's way too big for dumb stuff like Amazon return labels.<br/><br/>This printer is as small as you can get and still use laser toner (which you want if you're only printing 4-5x per year). The paper tray folds up and the print tray has a cover to prevent dust. It connects and remembers your WIFI. Printing is quick enough (10x faster than 90s laser printers). It's perfect to sit on a shelf and pull out as needed.</span>

<span>We've been buying inkjet printers for years and years, the printers always break down shortly after the warranty period ends. And ink cartridges are a rip off.  The last one (an HP) would use the color cartridge even when you said black ink only. GRRRRRR. I'd call it designed-in profit margin enhancement.<br/><br/>Since nearly all our printing is black and white, we took the plunge and got this laser printer from Brother.  It is easy to install, fast, trouble free and quiet. And it appears that the cost of printing will be about 1/10 what an ink jet costs. It's also very compact.<br/><br/>So, if you don't need color, BUY THIS PRINTER.  You will thank yourself every time you use it!</span>

<span>The last time I bought a Brothers product was some 25 years ago.  That product was an HL-8 which was advertised as plug compatible with the HP Lazerjet series 2.  The only thing they forgot to mention is that they had firmware code to prevent the use of any memory cards others than their own which cost about four times as much as the Lazerjet Series 2 equivalent.  I dumped the Brothers Lazer printer and purchased a Lazerjet instead.  Until now, I'd sworn off purchasing anything from Brothers because of the way they did business.<br/><br/>As for this printer ...<br/><br/>Setup was fairly easy though I did have some problems because I'm blind and couldn't see what I was doing.  I'm also a believer in "if all else fails, read the instructions."  Being blind, I really only need this for material I need to give to others.  To determine what is being printed, I use a scanner with opical recognition software.<br/><br/>Identifying the door for the toner cartridge was easy due to the plastic strap they leave dangling out.  It then took me a while of trying to fit the toner cartridge into the area before I discovered the slide out tray it fits in.  Then came figuring out the orientation for placing the cartridge in the tray and realizing that it has a protective cover over the back of the cartridge to protect the drum and prevent spilling the toner. The cover came off easily and then the toner cartridge slipped easily into the tray. It's hard to go wrong when installing the toner cartridge; it goes only one way and the front door won't close until the cartridge drawer is completely closed.  Note that the dangling plastic strap is attached to a plastic insert under the drawer.  I assumed that this thin plastic piece was just packing material, so I didn't try to replace it under the toner drawer.  I'll be checking the instructions to verify that this was just packing material.<br/><br/>That leaves only adding a stack of paper.  There is a wide notch near the front bottom of the printer to make opening the drawer very easy.  The paper needs to be pushed all of the way to the backstop of the drawer.  The back stops on the drawer can be adjusted for various paper lengths.  It may be necessary to lift the little paper sensor to insert a big stack of paper.  The front of the paper may be allowed to curve up over the inside area where the notch for opening the printer is located.  I found that the printer works as well whether the input paper is lying flat or is curved up at the front of the printer.<br/><br/>Normally, the paper feeds out onto the top of the printer, but there is a door at the back of the printer which can be opened to allow the paper to feed out the back; a necessary option when using very heavy paper or printing out slides for use with a projector.<br/><br/>Windows 7 identified the printer without problems but did not find appropriate drivers for it.  The proper drivers are on the supplied CD.  I had had to manually kick off Setup.exe and identify the printer model to install the drivers.<br/><br/>Once the drivers were installed, the printer proved to be very easy to use.  Since this printer allows printing on both sides of the paper, dialogue boxes allow you to select this option.  Note that the option may be in different places for different programs.  For notepad, it is hidden within the printer options subdialogue.  For Word, it is offered on the main dialogue.  It worked flawlessly for me in both cases.<br/><br/>Pros:<br/>easy to setup and use.<br/>Inexpensive; price is comparable to that of the cheap Inkjet printers.<br/>No ink to dry out.<br/>the paper source is inside the printer where it is protected from dust; a bit of a problem with Inkjet printers and older lazerjet printers.<br/>No external transformer box; the printer simply plugs into an outlet.<br/>Very fast compared to older lazer printers and especially compared to inkjet printers.<br/>Build quality is much superior to that commonly found on HP InkJet printers.<br/>The footprint is about the same as for a cheap HP Inkjet printer with the paper tray sticking out in front.<br/>No paper trays, etc. sticking out from the main printer body.<br/><br/>Cons:<br/>The toner cartridges are much smaller than those of the LaserJet Series 2 printers.  To make up for this, they also cost quite a bit less.  I have no idea of whether the cost per page is different between the old toner cartridges and these more compact ones.  My guess is that the smaller the cartridge, the higher the cost per pate.  However, for home use, any cost difference is likely trivial.  Also note that the standard Brother cartridges are available with two differing amounts of toner.  If you do a lot of printing, you'll be better off buying the more expensive version.<br/>No USB cable.  I just used the one that I was using for the Inkjet printer.<br/><br/>Highly recommended if you only want black and white (gray scale)printing.  Look elsewhere if you need color printing.  Also note that if you don't have a spare USB cable, you'll have to buy one.</span>

<span>I bought this model of Printer 8 years ago. Today I pulled out out of my closet, plugged it in, hit print and and printed 35+ pages in a minute without any hassle at all. Buying a simple laser printer (so ink does not dry out) was pretty much the best Idea I had, because prior to this me/my family had probably gone through half a dozen different HP ink printers that were all awful. This thing has gotta be one of the most reliable pieces of electronics I've ever bought.</span>

<span>Purchased this to replace an HP fancy printer I had recently purchased. The HP wasn’t ever able to get hooked up to my old desktop. More designed for office use. I especially like that this one can print on both sides of the paper. So easy to install and use. Print quality is good and speed good enough for me.</span>
