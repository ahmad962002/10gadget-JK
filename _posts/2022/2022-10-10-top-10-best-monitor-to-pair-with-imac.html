<span>Nice prompt delivery, well packaged.  Picture is good.  The tweaking selections are all on the back which makes it  hard to adjust since you can't see both sides at once, but if you get it figured out, finally, there are no complaints, but I wish it had a front bar or screen for that.  I think I could then really tweak it well.  Speakers are okay, again they face backwards instead of out the front where I am, and my computer speakers are better,  and there is no way to switch them or add stereo, which I could do if the setting was there for it.  But I could do headphones if I wanted that.  But for the money it's not a bad deal at all.  I got the 24 inch.  I desperately needed a bigger screen and this helped me out!  The color is good for my artwork.  I did have to call tech support for a question and they were very nice and helpful.  Not a super-perfect product but a really good one, and a great deal for the price.  Thanks!</span>

<span>I have two very old, inexpesive 18" monitors that have lasted a very long time, but one of them started flaking out when hooked up to my hub.  My office has much larger ones and thought this was a sign I should finally upgrade and get the same screen size at home as I do in the office.  But since my old monitors lasted a LONG time without paying a lot, I wanted to repeat that experience.  Lots of research and talking to other people led me to similar conclusion:  not a lot out there at a cheap price for larger sizes for people that just need a large working screen and not concerned about graphics and gaming.<br/>I had not heard of the Scepter brand before so I was a bit dubious.  But as I talked about my search with others, some programmers mentioned they HAD heard of them and were reputable.  They were about the best price and reviews largely good, so the programmer endorsement was what I needed to pull the trigger.<br/><br/>I'm very happy with these monitors!  Easy to set up.  Great resolution and color.  SO MUCH LIGHTER than my old ones.  I had to adjust the tension in my mounting arms accordingly.  I went with the standard, automatice calibration and haven't felt the need to fiddle with additional settings.  I'm an account/project manager that deals in spreadsheets, project management tools, Microsoft suite (Excel, Work, Outlook), and Adobe Creative Suite (Acrobat, Dreamweaver, Photoshop), and other custom tools for digital design, programming and management.<br/><br/>One thing I liked, and needed, is that the mounting screwholes on the back of the monitors are on the BOTTOM of the screen...rather than the middle or towards the top, which seems to be more standard.  This actually helped me get the monitors to the height I wanted with the mount I have without haveing to replace that too.  Works great for me, but might be a consideration for others, depending on how you plan to mount them.</span>

<span>These monitors are being used for a Super Smash Bros Ultimate tournament every week and are holding up strong. The picture is great, especially for the price, and it's incredibly easy to use. The only real downside I've had thus far with these is that the built-in speakers aren't very loud, but we are also using them in a crowded environment so that could just be a product of circumstances. Overall a very good value for the price.</span>

<span>These are not meant to be top of the line. But for the price they are pretty d*** good.<br/><br/>If youre on a budget its the way to go. However there are some acer ones that are $119 so IF you can swing up to that range, then there you go. If not, then welcome to the sceptre club.<br/><br/>After plugging an xbox series s in and playing some cod and watching a few videos on them. They’re pretty crispy for the price.<br/><br/>Happy gaming yall! 4.5 stars</span>

<span>I have a i8 8700 cpu with paired with a 5600xt graphics card. So you know that the card is going to run 1080p games smoothly. But pairing that with this monitor is just amazing! If youre just looking for 1080p and don't care about curve or framrates this monitor is great. I got one for like 50 bucks on offerup but wanted a second monitor for my setup. Second one looks better then the first. It has hdmi and vga (I use a display port to hdmi cable) there is no sound that comes from the monitor so be prepared to get either headphones or speakers.<br/>It's a 1080p monitor but instead of 60 frames it's 75 which isn't bad! But I recommend not paying 120 for this monitor try to wait to see if it goes down 100 or 75 dollars!</span>

<span>This review is for the SB220Q series (1920x1080) 75Hz monitor variant.  At a $90 price point as of July 2020, all of the praise this monitor has gotten and continues to get is pretty well deserved.  Right out of the box the factory calibration is pretty awful as with most TVs and monitors (I’ll never understand why that is), but Acer’s built-in menu gives you a wide range of control to tweak the image quality to your liking.  Here are some of the most noticeable Pros &amp; Cons after using this monitor daily for the past three weeks:<br/><br/>PROS:<br/>- The colors can be very vibrant and the sharpness makes everything nice and crisp both up close and from a distance without going overboard.  Although the spec sheet does not specify the exact Adobe or sRGB color gamut range, it does have a stated 72% NTSC coverage (keep in mind that the NTSC color gamut has the highest level of color reproduction), which would imply that it should have close to 100% sRGB coverage.  This is pretty standard for most sub $200 monitors (note: the unit that TechSpot tested came in at around 93% of sRGB coverage mostly losing detail in the green range so your unit’s reproduction may vary).  The 6-bits + FRC (equal to 8-bits) color depth is also an industry standard for entry level monitors and is completely fine for casual use.<br/><br/>- This montior’s “100,000,000:1” Dynamic Contrast Ratio (DCR) (non-standardized measure of contrast for videos) definitely seems to outperform my other slightly more expensive budget IPS monitors (the HP VH240a and ViewSonic VS2412-H)  that only have 20,000,000:1 and 50,000,000:1 contrast ratios respectively.  However, note that it still has an industry standard 1000:1 Static Contrast Ratio (measure for non-moving images) which isn’t great but is perfectly acceptable for casual viewing since only the highest tiered ($400+) IPS panels exceed that point with 1,500:1 being the maximum native contrast typically achievable with an IPS.<br/>~ A quick side note about that “100,000,000:1” DCR number:  there is no industry standard methodology for this particular measurement so the number itself is mostly useless marketing fluff.  But as I noted, compared to the two other monitors with the same industry standard SCR, this monitor did seem to outperform them both in that area.<br/><br/>- Its 102 PPI pixel density actually makes a subtle difference in image quality when viewing up close compared to my 24 inch 1080p monitors that have a 92 PPI.  Text seems to be a bit smoother in comparison.  This is purely an advantage of having the smaller 21.5 inch screen.<br/><br/>- The Color Adjustment Menu allows you to adjust both the RGB and CMY gains, bias, hues, and saturation levels to get a better color balance.<br/><br/>- The Picture Menu lets you adjust the screen’s brightness, contrast, gamma, and blackness (“black boost”) levels while also providing a ‘blue light’, ‘adaptive constrast’ (ACM), and a ‘Super Sharpness’ on/off switch.<br/><br/>- The Game Menu has FreeSync (for AMD GPUs) and Overdrive options<br/><br/>CONS:<br/>- The bezels are a bit thicker than I woud’ve liked (they’re about 1 cm on the top, left, and right sides) making the frameless design nothing more than a gimmick.<br/><br/>- The top-down viewing angle is noticeably darker compared to looking at the screen head on.<br/><br/>- Despite having a good DCR of 100M:1, the blacks are still a bit too bright for watching anything with heavy dark scenes since the display itself does not have any HDR capabilities with high contrast control zones aka local dimming (to be fair, this is completely expected at this $90 price point and is only being mentioned as reference for those that may be thinking of using this monitor to watch TV/movies).<br/><br/>- The Picture Menu’s ‘Super Sharpness’ option is just an on/off switch; it does not give you a more granular adjustment control over the amount of sharpness to apply.<br/><br/>- Even with all of the image quality adjustment options available in the settings, the whites remain on the slightly warmer side of the color temperature chart.  It’s not that noticeable when viewing on this monitor alone, but the difference can be seen if you have another slightly cooler display adjacent to it.  This is most likely just an issue with my particular unit since other reviews have noted their unit had a more neutral or “near perfect” white temp.<br/><br/>- It only has a paltry 15° degree back tilt compared to most other budget monitors being able to tilt closer to 30° degrees (this is super nitpicky as compromises are to be expected at a sub $100 price point).<br/><br/>- The Power button is completely indistinguishable from the rest of the menu buttons (both in shape and spacing).<br/><br/>Overall, if you’re looking for a nice quality budget monitor to look at spreadsheets, word documents, and do some internet browsing or even some light casual gaming, then this is a great choice.  If you are a competitive gamer, photographer, professional editor, or a content creator then you’ll obviously need to invest in a higher spec monitor.</span>

<span>I was worried that being a thin monitor that it was going to be fragile, but it has a small bulk behind the monitor that takes care of any worries.

<span>This review is for the “(Sceptre 20" 1600 x 900 75Hz LED Monitor 2X HDMI VGA Built-in Speakers, sRGB 99% Machine Black (E209W-16003RT Series) aka “20” 75Hz Wide Viewing Angle” monitor.<br/>I got 2 of these for $115/ea. It was difficult to return them and go with two Samsung 1080p IPS 22” monitors instead. For some reason, the non-IPS screens (like these) have a hard time displaying an even black/gray screen. The pictures with the grayscale test have my very high-quality laptop monitor below them as a reference in each picture for what the black/gray screen SHOULD look like. The monitor is on the top of each picture and my laptop is below it. The laptop screen is mirrored on the Spectre monitor above it. These exhibit pretty bad “ghosting.” To be fair, it is not as bad in real life as the camera makes the monitor look. But I still found it too distracting to work with. Because the screen is always darker at the top than the bottom (regardless of viewing angle), it can be difficult to see vertical scroll bars because it fades from normal at the top to washed-out at the bottom. Googling information can also be difficult because the color change of a site you have already been to on Google is more difficult to see at the bottom of the screen than at the top. It is also harder to work in Excel because the grid lines are not an even shade across the entire screen. It is not horrible like the HP V20 HD+ 19.5-inch monitor. But it is still not great. I found it too distracting to work with as a home office monitor. There should be 6 pictures showing the different shades of black/gray mirrored off my laptop onto the Spectre 20” monitor. The monitor in the picture also has a bad pixel a few inches from the top left corner that you can see in the darkest pictures as green. I personally do not take off points because my specific product/item has a flaw/defect. Even the best manufacturers have products that pass quality control. So I simply mention it and let readers decide for themselves if it is too common of a problem for them to decide not to purchase it. I only give bad reviews for “systemic problems” that affect all of a product line like this. There are many different options for changing the brightness, tint, color, sharpness, etc. But unfortunately, because the screen is not even, if the top looks good the bottom looks bad and vice versa.<br/><br/>On the good side it does have some really nice features for the money. I will miss the dual HDMI ports and the speakers even though they’re not very good. But this allows you to plug in a Roku stick and watch/listen to TV while working on the other monitor if you have two (see picture). I also personally liked the size better than the 22” Samsung 1080p monitors I’m keeping. Two 22” monitors are a little big for my very small desk even when VESA mounted. The Spectre monitors are also VESA mountable which was another reason I purchased them. They come with screws that create a gap of about ¾” between the monitor and a VESA mount (see picture). I’m not exactly sure why they did this, but it does make it easier to access cables in the back and it was not an inconvenience for me. There are many different options for changing the brightness, tint, color, sharpness, etc. But unfortunately, because the screen is not even, if the top looks good the bottom looks bad and vice versa.<br/><br/>If you don’t have much money and these are on sale for $120 or less, it might be a monitor worth considering. But the one I opened to try/test had a defective pixel so I had to return it anyways. And I never opened the 2nd one because I decided I just couldn’t work with this monitor for most likely many years. The Samsung’s look fantastic straight out of the box without having to mess with screen adjustments. And I got them on sale from Amazon for $140/ea. For my needs, as a home office monitor(s), the Samsung’s are much better and worth the extra $25/ea. But the Samsung 22" IPS monitors are normally $165+/ea. It would have been a more difficult choice if I had to pay full price for the Samsung’s.</span>

<span>I use this for my 8 camera security system. That being said I can really only adjust display settings with the monitor. The camera system has a default display which I already set with another monitor. I made small adjustments to the color to my personal liking as it was a bit bright by default for what I'm doing with it.<br/>The setup for the factory stand was super easy and simple. You really don't even need the instructions all you have to do is look at it. Once out of the box, it took maybe 5 minutes to setup and have powered on and displaying a picture.<br/>This is the second monitor I've bought from this company Sceptre and they never disappoint. Would 100% recommend this product and many of their other products as well! The other one I bought is a curved 24" 4k monitor, it works perfect for gaming. This 20" 1080 monitor will likely do the same for you if it's what you desire.<br/>As always, inspect the product when it arrives.</span>

<span>Another reviewer mentioned a way to increase the volume on the built in speakers (as the factory default setting is set at only 50%) and mentioned monitor "management".  For the life of me, I could not find this option in Windows 10.  I was getting ready to return the monitor but just for kicks, I decided to look at the Users Manual.  (who reads these things these days anyway, especially for a monitor?).  Lo and behold, there are actual physical buttons hidden away on the bottom right corner of the monitor that activates the "monitor management" function that is independent of the Computer Operating System.  Press the one on the far left to get into this mode (see second photo).  From here you can get into various modes one of which is to change the default volume setting.  See attached photos.  I hope this will save others who are puzzled as to why in the heck is the volume so low from the monitor speakers.</span>

<span>I'm very happy with this monitor.  I was able to try it out at a former employer's office.  At home, I had a larger monitor and unfortunately, larger isn't always better.<br/><br/>I like this size of this display.  My monitor is only about 24" away from my face and I have decent vision with diminishing reading vision.  Looking at a larger monitor was more than annoying, it just wasn't good to use and it made me not want to use my home computer.<br/><br/>Using this monitor at 1920 x 1080 (recommended for this screen), and having the magnification set to 100% (Control Panel &gt; Appearance and Personalization &gt; Display = "smaller") is great!<br/><br/>I don't do gaming and I haven't used the internal speakers.  Can't rate those.<br/><br/>I sometimes change the color settings to help minimize the impact on viewing screens late at night (Warm, Neutral, Cool, Low Blue Light, Night, Reading, HP Enhance +, or Custom RGB).  This is helpful.<br/><br/>I am able to tilt the screen down and up with ease.  And the rotate to portrait is great (raise display to highest settings and tilt back to clear the desk), but my old laptop can't change the settings to view in portrait.<br/><br/>I recommend this monitor.  It's great that it can also go on a stand that holds double screens.  And with the very thin left and right frame sides, it would be a great monitor to use 2 or 3 side-by-side.</span>

<span>The Apple Magic Key Keyboard is solidly built with good "finger feel" on the keys, along with good weight and good battery life.  But it's a tad too small for average adult hands.  As a result, I find myself making more typographical errors than in Apple's full-size Magic Keyboard.  But the small size of this unit is good for small tabletops or for carrying the keyboard in briefcases for mobile use.  It would be nice if Apple produced a mid-size wireless keyboard with dimensions that were midway between the small and large versions of the Magic Keys keyboard to better accommodate adult hands... especially for those of us who use it for full-time desktop use with an Apple Studio computer.  Maybe over time I'll get used to the keyboard's small size and be able to type more accurately with it.</span>

<span>This USB cable was too short, ( I selected the wrong size ) so I ended up taking it back. If it's a 2.0 length you need, it may do the trick for you. The quality is nothing fancy and looks a bit on the cheaper side, so it may pay to keep an eye on it to see that it plays nice in treating your device well. I cannot rate how well it works, but it looks and feels simple, yet functional.</span>

<span>Used this (along with an HDMI cord and a 3.5 aux cable) to hook my mom's old white '06 MacBook up to her giant flatscreen so she and her boyfriend can watch Amazon Prime, etc. on the big screen. I had used a different set up, mini DVI to DVI adapter and then a DVI to HDMI cable, to hook my own laptop up years ago and that had worked perfectly so I was a little nervous about using a different method. But this is much less bulky and offered the options of choosing many different lengths of HDMI cables (her laptop is on her desk and the sofa is between it and the tv). Would definitely buy again. The picture is perfect.</span>

<span>Ok, obviously you have to know if this cable fits ur laptop people.  how ridiculous is it to have dvi port and give a product a 1 star rating because it's a mini dvi cable.  So IF you have a mini dvi port, this cable is FREAKING AWESOME. It's like 1/30th the price of what apple will charge you for a mini dvi to dvi, and then a dvi to hdmi.  this is all in one, and like 6 inches long, then just hook it up to any hdmi cable, and then to ur tv.  The display looks amazing.  I'm really happy with it.  Just be careful when inserting it into ur computer.  The port looks a little bit fragile...hope this helps!!!  (also, audio doesn't flow through this as mini dvi doesn't send out audio...you'll need a two sided male headphone cord, then plug that into the auxilary of ur stereo or something</span>

<span>The MacBook Pro with thunderbolt connectors have a native displayport signal integrated within, which, unfortunately requires conversion when using HDMI cables. I purchased these cables to maintain the standard displayport signal to a pair of 4K curved Samsung monitors and it solved the problems of overheating from the HDMI conversion handily. Now, the monitors operate as expected in clamshell mode and resolution is perfect at 3840x2160 @ 60Hz. I couldn't be more pleased to have solved such a vexing problem with such a simple solution.</span>

<span>Where my OEM Surface Dock would not recognize my new 49-inch Samsung widescreen correctly, this little cable plugged into both the Surface Pro 7 USB-C Port and my monitor's Display Port, and Windows correctly discovered the monitor and offered the correct default resolution of 5120x1440. I could not be happier! It is very disappointing that the Microsoft Surface Dock simply does not discover the monitor correctly (as is well documented on multiple Microsoft forums,) but this $14 cable is a very satisfactory solution, at least for one monitor.</span>

<span>Ok, this one easy to set up and get the second monitor up and running.<br/>But as you keep working, interacting with the second monitor slows down to less than comfortable levels. The mouse pointer lags behind your movement around the screen. Further,  the pointer goes from the normal size to a giant size leading to frequent confusions. I have to calibrate my mouse moves to account for the change in window size, the font size, and the pointer size when I move a window from my main display to the second one. Several display configuration changes have failed to improve the situation.<br/><br/>I do not know if this is something unique to me, but having this unit plugged in and recording a Zoom video introduces some kind of a humming noise at the very beginning of the recorded audio. And this happened *ONLY* the one time I was plugged into the second monitor when recording the video.<br/><br/>Maybe this is something you may want to test.<br/><br/>Not the best, but it definitely has helped me in situations when I needed a second monitor with my laptop (with a busted HDMI port).</span>
