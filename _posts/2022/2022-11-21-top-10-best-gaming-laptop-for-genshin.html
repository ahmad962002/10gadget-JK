<span>This product has surprised me very very well. With no upgrades I was able to run a multitude of very strenuous programs such as Photoshop, blender, open Iv. I also game on FiveM and this laptop again no upgrades added ran at 60-80 fps. Now fiveM is a custom modded gtav game. I am very happy with this product. Only upgrades I would suggest is a another 8gb stick of ram and installing a m.2 for the most optimized experience. I would give this product a 100/10!!!! I would buy it again!</span>

<span>Edit: This was originally a five-star review. I'm still really happy with my purchase, but I ran into stuttering on YouTube videos and unimpressive/inconsistent download times that I couldn't seem to fix. Come to find out the wifi cards that come preinstalled on these laptops leave something to be desired. This isn't a big deal if you have an ethernet cable handy, but it would likely be a massive pain for anyone meaning to, say, write an essay at a coffee shop.<br/><br/>I swapped out the wifi card in my old laptop for the one in this one and it works flawlessly. I can't vouch for it, but I've read Intel's AX200NGW wifi card is a good replacement for the one that comes stock in these machines. If you're going to be adding RAM or an extra HDD anyway, swapping out the wifi card isn't too difficult; the tiny connectors are just really finicky. I could live with the wifi as it was, but I don't have access to a wired connection as much as I'd like. If that's you, be prepared for a bit of tinkering.<br/><br/>Everything else I said stands.<br/><br/>Edit 2: Elden Ring runs great on this.<br/><br/>----<br/><br/>I paid a little under $750 for this laptop. Out the gate, I added 32GB of RAM, which cost me around $150. That's overkill - 16GB is perfectly serviceable on this configuration, especially without a secondary SSD, and 16GB would cost roughly half that. I wanted to future proof my purchase and make it simple to switch out my secondary mechanical drive in the future.<br/><br/>I would absolutely recommend swapping the RAM for two 16GB sticks (you want them to be the same variety to get the most performance and bang for your buck) and the 8GB my model came with is only just enough for Windows at this point. If you only intend to run Steam and some games, it might do. If you have a Chromium-based web browser running in the background, forget about it. Trust me - extra RAM will save you a lot of headache.<br/><br/>My model didn't come with easy access panels on the back for adding an HDD or for changing out the RAM. Luckily the screws are fairly easy to remove, and the panel came off pretty easily with a plastic pry tool. (Amazon sells the kit I use - it's really handy to have on hand in case you ever need to get inside your machine. Search "Syntus Electronic Repair Tool Kit with Magnetic Driver Kit, 80 in 1 Professional Precision Screwdriver Set with Portable Pouch for iPhone, iPad, MacBook, Gaming Console, Controller, Black")<br/><br/>There's two M.2 slots and one SATA slot. I wouldn't recommend mounting a second M.2 drive - one, I'm not sure how you'd safely mount it in this revision. Two, if you watch Linus Tech Tips video on the performance difference between a SATA SSD and M.2 drives, you'll see that the average user isn't going to notice a difference between the two types of SSDs. Frankly, my 7200rpm mechanical drive loads things really quickly on this laptop, so I'm not even in a rush to upgrade from that. Games like The Witcher 3 run perfectly fine off of it. (And honestly, if you're on a budget and don't want to deck out this laptop with the best kit it can handle, 2TB 7200rpm mechanical drives can be had for around $40-$80 these days.)<br/><br/>The build quality is fantastic. You can tell which parts of it are a little cheaper than others - I'd be careful with the plastic tabs when you're prying the bottom off; take your time with it - but it feels solid the moment you take it out the box. The back of the IPS panel is mounted to metal. The bezels are designed such that it's entirely feasible for you, as the user, to open up and work on your own hardware. From a right-to-repair standpoint, this machine is as good as it gets in this price range. Even if you have no interest in working on it or ever opening it up, you can take it to a local computer shop and be rest assured they can easily get to whatever they need to work on.<br/><br/>The screen is the part most likely to fail on a laptop over extended use. I haven't cracked open the bezel on my unit because my screen was in perfect working order and after a nightmare I had with a different laptop, I just wanted to get back to using my computer. Looking up tutorials and images online, every model of this computer I've seen uses screws to hold the screen in place. No glue or anything like that. In the event that you or a technician ever needs to swap out the screen for a different one, it should be a fairly simple process.<br/><br/>And again I return to build quality - I've noticed very little light bleed when I'm running various applications. This is not the best ips panel I have ever used, but let me stress again - for the price? It's amazing. High refresh rate. Everything is crystal clear. Good contrast. It's been a joy to do photo editing work on it.<br/><br/>For gaming - I use Linux as my daily driver, and removed Windows from this device as soon as I got it set up and made sure there weren't any malfunctions or defects that would warrant calling the manufacturer or returning it to Amazon.<br/><br/>If you're curious whether this makes a good Linux machine - yes, with some caveats. My model - 15ACH6 - did not have working wifi out of the box in Pop OS or Manjaro.<br/><br/>I initially wanted to use Pop OS because it has great hybrid graphics support (better than Windows, if you ask me) and it comes pre-packed with tools to help maximize your laptop's battery life. However, making the wifi work wasn't a simple fix. There are several methods; the least complicated one for me was upgrading the kernel. Problem is - Pop OS is an Ubuntu-based OS and isn't designed to have the kernel upgraded independent of the operating system.<br/><br/>Long story short - I got Pop OS working perfectly, but getting the kernel upgraded was just the first issue I had to solve. I also had to change the power management settings so my wifi wasn't throttled, and my printer was detected but wasn't working properly out of the box.<br/><br/>Manjaro makes it easy to upgrade the kernel, and I was up and running within an hour. The thing that took the longest was waiting for all the updates to install. The only thing I had to do to make full use of my hardware was update the Nvidia drivers, manually install the Optimus Switcher (look up "How to setup Optimus Manager on Manjaro! | DenshiHelp" on YouTube, especially if you use KDE) and adjust the power management settings.<br/><br/>If you're a Linux user or you're Linux-curious, Manjaro is your best bet on this thing if you want a relatively painless experience. (This is also why I bought so much RAM - if I absolutely have to use Windows for any reason, I want the extra memory to run a VM.)<br/><br/>Mind, this shouldn't be an issue in the future. The latest version of Pop OS at the time of this writing is 21.10. If you get this same model of this laptop and newer revisions of the major Linux operating systems have been released, it should be a fairly seamless experience regardless of which one you choose.<br/><br/>I also want to note - in terms of getting this laptop to boot from USB, this was by far the most painless experience I've had. Any other laptop I've had has fought me tooth and nail when I wanted to remove Windows and install Linux. Part of that's the AMD architecture - in my experience, AMD respects their users more than Intel or Nvidia does, so if that's important to you, this is a great machine. If you've ever heard of Intel's Management Engine, AMD's equivalent - the PSP - can be just be switched off in the BIOS. Not once has this machine tried to tell me - its owner and end user - what I can and cannot do with it.<br/><br/>But back to gaming - I didn't try to run anything on Windows, but I can tell you just from the hardware specs you're going to have a great experience with anything released from 2018-2020, and the GTX 1650 would be a respectable graphics card even in a desktop at this point thanks to the current market. You most likely won't be running a game released in 2022 on Ultra on this laptop, but you should be able to get admirable performance on medium-to-high settings running something that just released.<br/><br/>On Linux running Proton - The Witcher 3 runs flawlessly for me on the highest settings using the current experimental version of Proton through Steam. Crash Bandicoot N. Sane Trilogy, runs flawlessly. All the indie and retro-style platformers I threw at it - Cuphead, Bloodstained Curse of the Moon, Blaster Master Zero - flawless. Streets of Rage 4, Mother Russia Bleeds, Terraria, Celeste, Knights of the Old Republic 2 - those are Linux native so they ran for me as well as they do in Windows. Most of your older RPGs like Fallout: New Vegas and Morrowind will run amazingly on here regardless of what OS you're using.<br/><br/>I won't sugarcoat it and tell you that gaming on Linux is every bit as good as gaming on Windows. It's not. If you want to play the latest multiplayer games with your friends or you like to hop around and try different games when they come out without having to check if they work and without having to tinker, keep Windows on this machine.<br/><br/>For me - I have always been about 5 years behind the curve, my favorite games are in 2D, and I refuse to play games with excessive DRM (here's looking at you, Denuvo) or invasive anti-cheat (that is a security timebomb waiting to go off) so my experience switching from Windows to Linux has been relatively painless as a gamer. Valve's Proton is at a great place right now, and if you look up anything that's Steam Deck verified you should have a good time. You've got hundreds - if not thousands - of games at your disposal regardless of what kind of OS you're running.<br/><br/>To end this off - I am in love with this laptop, and I would gladly get another Lenovo machine in the future. The 8 gigs of RAM it came with is a little lean, but it's an easy upgrade, and you will definitely want to add a harddrive anyway. The IO is a little lacking at a mere two USB 3.0 ports, but - they're both USB 3, and you can attach a USB hub. (Just don't run an external HDD off it as most USB hubs don't draw additional power from the slot.)<br/><br/>The build quality is rock solid. The specs are respectable enough that it will breathe new life into your older games and allow you to play most newer titles. You can easily do photo and video editing on this. It's set up to be easy to clean, maintenance, and repair. All in all, for less than $800? This thing is a steal.</span>

<span>So far this laptop seems decent. Manage you’re expectations. You can’t buy a mid-range gaming laptop and expect all the best. I’ve yet to try some of the more demanding games. But for the games I play these days, like Fortnite, Apex, Rust, R6 Siege, Subnautica, and No Man’s Sky, it’s performing pretty well.<br/><br/>I will say one thing negative: in the pictures, the USB-C port shows the Thunderbolt icon. When I received my laptop, the Thunderbolt icon was missing and only showed the normal USB icon. I was excited for the thunderbolt port but alas the port is not Thunderbolt. This cost them a star on my review simply because having it in the pictures is misleading and they should be updated to reflect the correct icon.</span>

<span>Detailed First Impression Review<br/><br/>I’ve been on Xbox for a long time for gaming and wanted to see the hype behind PC gaming. I do many things with my computer that a desktop would not work for me, as I have to move it around frequently and like portability, so I explored into the gaming laptop world. This was a cheaper, yet good option for an entry level Device.<br/><br/>Processor- I bought the i7-11800H model and this processor seems to be a bit overkill for even some higher end games. But it’s great to have that extra power to multitask as well. I have not had any issues with the processing power. It’s fast and smooth.<br/><br/>Graphics- I’m using the RTX-3050Ti and I’ve seen the card likes to run at 100% nearly all the time when in a game but I have had no issues with its capability of running smoothly and not overheating, and I haven’t even tried any undervolting yet which could improve it more.<br/><br/>RAM- the 16gb ram and 4gb vram work well together. I use the heavily graphic related game of BeamNG Drive that requires a lot of RAM to run smooth and have tried several multiplayer games and have never seen the RAM get over 70% (which is pretty good for heavily demanding games). This was Plenty of RAM for the gaming I do to keep it running smooth.<br/><br/>Overall- this is a great starting laptop for anyone looking for a gaming laptop or something fast for multitasking. Sure there might be a couple other options with similar price ranges that might perform slightly better. But this one was the lowest price I saw for what you get out of it and it’s been working just fine for me. I haven’t had it long so I may be back to update this if my opinion changes lol. But first impressions were really good.<br/><br/>Negatives- the graphics card works really great as mentioned above, but if you use it running at 100% for a couple hours you can completely notice a performance drop because the temperature starts to get too hot. I haven’t had it overheat but I have had some slight performance differences after a while of hard use. That’s really the only “issue”, that’s not a huge deal, that I’ve had. And it’s correctable by changing up some deeper settings.<br/><br/>As I have mentioned, this is a great ENTRY Level laptop. I would not recommend this laptop to anyone that is heavily into gaming. It works great for what I want to do with it but it would work pretty bad for a professional gamer (not that pros would ever use a laptop for gaming lol). I am also newer to PC gaming but I’m pretty savvy with computers. So being able to change some settings that the average newer user wouldn’t know how to, without YouTube tutorials, have made this laptop perform a little better than out of the box. But these changes I made so far are all settings included on the computer, not third party software included in this review (meaning anyone can change the basic settings to improve the performance slightly as I have).<br/><br/>PS- I thought I had a dead laptop when it came like other reviewers complained about. I read the review of one person that said you have to jam the power plug in there really good til it clicks for it to work. I initially thought I pushed hard enough and heard a light snapping sound, but it wouldn’t charge or turn on. So I pushed a lot harder and heard it click a lot louder and it started charging perfectly fine and started up right away.</span>

<span>Got for a steam gamer kid's birthday. He was really happy with the hardware and design. So far it's handled everything he can throw at it, performance wise. Setup and upgrades were very easy. It's heavy, but it's huge and a great machine. The cooling system is kinda loud, but it works well to offset the heat produced. Definitely not a very portable laptop due to weight, but very sturdy and absolutely gorgeous. Really happy with the purchase.</span>

<span>I don't do a lot of heavy gaming, so I wanted to buy a low-level gaming laptop because I knew it would do everything I needed to do. For context, the main games I play on my laptop are The Sims (with a ton of cc and a few mods), Stardew Valley (with a fair amount of mods), Terraria, and then basic in-browser games like tetris and whatever else when I'm truly bored. For the most part, this computer has handled running them all super well. Surprisingly, it has the most difficulty with the in-browser games, which tend to lag or drop frames. To be fair, I don't really know why Mahjongg 3D needs to be rendered in such intense detail anyway, but whatever.<br/><br/>I don't have a lot of complaints about this computer. It does what I needed it to do. A couple of times I've had to reset my settings because my built-in microphone will randomly turn itself completely off. Also, sometimes, when I'm switching tabs or something, my screen will just go black for a second or two. That's the biggest complaint. If I needed to use this machine to play Valorant or Fortnite or whatever, a few seconds of a black screen could cost me the game. However, I'm still satisfied with all that I'm able to do using this computer, especially considering the price. I've been using the same old computer for ages because every subsequent computer has just been too slow for me. I'm happy to say that this is not the case with this computer, and as long as it runs decently and lets me play The Sims and watch Netflix, I probably will stay pretty happy.</span>

<span>This was the first gaming computer I ever bought, so I had no idea that the plugs were different from regular computers. When I first plugged it in and tried to turn it on, nothing happened. I thought I got a bum computer! I called the number on the package and was told that gaming computers have different plugs than standard computers, and that I had to push the plug into the back of the computer all the way until I heard a click. I thought I had, but when I pushed on it again I heard the click and it started right up.<br/><br/>Onto the computer itself... the graphics are great, the speed has worked well for all the games used so far (Minecraft, Bloons TD6, etc.), the picture is vivid, and I have no complaints so far!</span>

<span>Runs most games I throw at it pretty well. I played Cyberpunk 2077, Resident Evil 2 remake, and Resident Evil Village pretty well. Keep in mind though that you'll need to bump down the graphics settings in very graphically intense games like Cyberpunk and RE Village; if you're looking for a machine that can run those games at the very highest settings you'll definitely need to shell out a few hundred more dollars.<br/><br/>Everyday use is quick also. I always have a million Chrome tabs open and this PC takes it like a champ. No issues there.<br/><br/>The screen is pretty nice as well. Gets more than bright enough for every indoor situation I've thrown at it and it's sharp enough. However, I have yet to take it outside (and I don't plan on it), so I don't know if it gets bright enough to overcome direct sunlight.<br/><br/>The IO array should be alright for most people. It's got two USB type A's (one on each side), an HDMI port, an ethernet port, one USB type C (which apparently you can use to charge the laptop, though I haven't tested it), a headphone jack, and an SD card reader, which is much appreciated.<br/><br/>The speakers are alright to my untrained ears. They're not insanely bassy but they're also not super tinny. They're plenty loud and easy to hear in most situations, but occasionally I do find myself using a Chrome extension to force the volume louder on softer YouTube videos, so keep that in mind.<br/><br/>The only thing I can really complain about is battery life. It's not great. Using power saving mode, I was only able to get a few hours of light work done on Chrome. If you need something portable with a battery that will last you an entire day, this ain't it. At all.<br/><br/>Overall, I don't regret my purchase. It's powerful enough to run most games at at least medium settings, it has a nice screen, a really nice keyboard, a good trackpad, and is enjoyable to use on the day to day. Just keep in mind that the battery life isn't good. If what you're looking for a powerful budget gaming laptop that you plan on keeping connected to a wall and just want the convenience of being able to move it around the house, then this might be the laptop for you.</span>

<span>Well, it really is premature to write a review about a laptop on the day it was received but I was loving how it felt in my hands that I just had to say a few things about it.<br/><br/>It is by far the best, fastest laptop or pc I have ever owned. I was so impressed with how fast programs seemed to download and install. It was pretty amazing to me. Even in comparison to a relatively new and powerful laptop owned by my wife, this was far quicker and snappier.<br/><br/>I was disappointed in finding out that it uses a proprietary charger. I was really hoping it would be a usb c charger. Can't win them all.<br/><br/>I had to settle for a non touch laptop. In order to get the other components, the graphics card and the processor etc, I wasn't able to find a combo with a touchscreen so I had to settle for this. But this is not a negative on this laptop.<br/><br/>Even coming out of the box you could tell it was premium. The packaging was really good and protective. It even came inside a soft cloth bag. First time I've had a laptop come that way.<br/><br/>The screen is sharp and very clear. Obviously, I still need to test it and put it through it's paces to see how beautiful things will look but the few video clips i put up sounded and looked great.<br/><br/>Update: I reduced the rating by 1 star all related to 1 thing. Battery life. I lowered the refresh rate on the screen to 60hz with intent to increase it if and when I game. With settings like this, the laptop seems like it would run for around 5 hours but that's an estimate. And that is not bad. Throw in something that uses the gpu and you get very little. In fact, I was running a golf simulator program called e6 and casting the screen to a 2nd laptop screen. In that mode, this laptop died in about an hour. I shouldn't be surprised though as nobody would game on battery power... Not for a serious gaming session. I still thought I'd get more than 1 hour.<br/><br/>Other than that, the laptop performance is spot on and pretty amazing. Crisp and snappy... Fast. Coming from a 6 yr old unit... This thing feels amazing in comparison. Startup is done in a matter of seconds and away you go...</span>

<span>Okay, so I was hesitant on this laptop because some of the reviews mentioned bad temperatures. I was concerned with getting a laptop with bad thermal paste (which does happen). However, the laptop came super well! Lots of reviewers fail to mention the healthy temperature levels. Idle should be 30-45c. And under full load it should never go past 85c. EVER!!! If it goes past, it's likely it could either be, 1: Bad Thermal Paste/application, 2: Bad Fans, 3:Lack of contact with HeatSinks. 4: Bad Ventilation. If buying new, and the temps aren't matching, exchange it, as shipping can sometimes damage components. Laptops generally require maintenance. If heavy using, 1-2 Years.  Make sure those temps never go past 85c. Over time you will have to replace the thermal paste or fans may give out. Grizzly Kryonaute is the best paste.  Those are very very easy fixes. Just keep that in mind when buying ANY gaming laptop! If you are scared to tamper with it, buy some insurance and send it to acer. (Continuing with the review......)  With poor ventilation I was reaching 85c. I bought a laptop cooler, the IETS with rubber rings. I'm getting incredible temperatures! Never going past 78c! This laptop is very heavy on proper Ventilation. If you look at the design there are a ton of vents from the bottom that push out through the top of the keyboard. S1I think a laptop cooler is necessary if you're gonna be gaming. This thing is incredible.  I'm running games on High/Max settings (Elden Ring, warzone, apex) and getting awesome frames. I upgraded the ram to 32GB and this thing is a work horse. Dual rank 3200 32gb ram will increase your frames by about 15, and more opened tabs!! ;) I also installed a 2tb samsung ssd. (Which I highly recommend you do) It is much easier to install an nvme than the SATA one. So I would recommend getting a m.2 nvme. Opening the back piece for upgrades can be a challenge. There Is a trick to it, and it's likely you will break something if you don't get it right. So don't force it!  So be very careful and gentle when doing it. Use a pick to slowly Pry it open. Pull from the vents back side. The battery can get kinda hot too. So make sure it's in a good spot. You can also set the battery charge level to 80% for longer battery lifespan. That's pretty much it! It's an amazing laptop for the price and power! Bang for your buck! Happy gaming!</span>

<span>Had this since January! Absolutely incredible upgrade from my crappy 8 year old Lenovo. Turbo fan speed is an absolute plus. I play League of Legends, World of Warcraft, Stardew, etc. I play with everything set high. LEDs are my fave. Got a fan lapdesk that also has LEDs and it helps a lot with keeping the laptop cool. Great product. Love it.</span>

<span>I've only had this for a day now, so I can't speak to longevity. All in all I'm pleased with this laptop. It's lightweight but packs a punch still. Set up and updating was quick and easy. It's a great utilization of space, only a slim border around the screen and keyboard.<br/><br/>A few first impression negatives: you can see in other review images that it comes with 5 semi permanent stickers, (Nvidia, Intel, Alexa, 144hz, and a long feature banner). That was a bummer because they weren't in the product image, and they look awful (not to mention some were crooked). Thankfully they're removable, though I had to use glass cleaner to get rid of residue from one. Not a big deal though. The frame is very lightweight and flexible. The feet keep it raised which is good for cooling, but any pressure on the middle makes it flex, which I don't love. It's not going to crumble, but it's definitely a step down from my Lenovo with a metal body. You're paying for the internal components, not the frame.</span>

<span>I needed to replace my previous laptop after 5+ years, but I didn't want to break the bank. After researching different gaming laptops, the Acer Nitro 5 stood out as the best balance between price and performance.<br/><br/>I was nervous about upgrading to Windows 11 (I'd avoided upgrading from Windows 7 to 8 because of the terrible UI), but it's actually very clean and minimalist.<br/><br/>The Nitro 5's performance has blown my expectations out of the water. My previous laptop could barely scrape by the FFXIV benchmark on "normal laptop" settings, but the Nitro 5 scored very high on the "high desktop" settings. I've signed up for PC Game Pass to take advantage of my new hardware power, and it's been amazing playing Microsoft Flight Simulator on high settings.<br/><br/>I did end up buying an extra 8GB Crucial RAM, and installing that was a breeze.<br/><br/>Fantastic value for the price!</span>

<span>I've been using this laptop for a little over a week now and it's been solid all across the board. Fans are pretty quiet (Similar to Asus Strix\RoG laptops) The CPU is obnoxiously powerful. I can't say anything about the RAM because I replaced mine to 32GB almost instantly.<br/><br/>According to Acer's customer support, my specific model supported 64GB of ram, but I only upgraded it to 32GB because there was a lot of conflicting information between what they said, what other people said and what crucial system checker said. So I went with just 32GB to be safe.<br/><br/>This Killer Intel Wi-Fi card is performing the same as my other card (Intel AX200NGW). So I guess Killer fixed their problems. If you did have issues, you can upgrade\change the card as long as it's a M.2: 2230 CNVio2 NGW card.<br/><br/>The screen is solid, same brightness I'm used to and it's 144hz so that's a plus for gaming.<br/><br/>Keyboard feels nice, everything is very responsive and nothing feels awkward even though it's a small layout with a number pad.<br/><br/>Opening the back of the case was a little rough at first, but once I figured out how it opens I've had no problems since.<br/><br/>The RAM I used can be found on Amazon if you put (G.Skill RipJaws Series 32GB (2 x 16GB) 260-Pin SO-DIMM PC4-25600 DDR4 3200 CL22-22-22-52 1.20V Dual Channel Memory Model F4-3200C22D-32GRS) in the search bar.</span>

<span>Overall this is a great laptop. It has handled everything I have tried from work to gaming. The problem with it is, I plugged it into my monitor using a usb c pass-through. It worked great and charged like it was plugged in directly to the charger that came with it. After disconnecting it and plugging in directly again, the laptop would not charge and kept showing message "Please use original Asus charger."  It was connected using the one that came with it. The battery ended up dying and would not charge. I had to RMA it. Haven't received it back and and has been 2 weeks but Asus says they fixed it now. Others have complained about the same issue and Asus has replaced everything from the motherboard and battery to the entire laptop to fix the problem. Asus compatible plugs don't work either.<br/><br/>Update- I received it back from Asus RMA. During the time they were fixing it, there was minimal communication from them on it. It took 2 weeks for them to return it and FEDEX kept delaying the shipment. The day I received it, the box was open partially but luckily Asus did a good job on packaging it. I had to really dig online to figure out what they had done to it. They replaced the MB, power unit and supply, and memory. Practically a new laptop. Out of the box reser it up and it worked but the performance was very poor. Freezing up and running slow. I used the system restore and it still had issues. I ended up going to Microsoft and downloading a fresh copy of Windows 11 from there and installing with it. That was a process as well because Windows did not see the hard drive during the boot to install. Once I finally got Windows reinstalled and My Asus and other software back on, it has been running great. I have not tried a second monitor again, too afraid to honestly, but I have used the second USB-C with my portable M2 drives. That works fine. It has been running for almost 2 weeks without issue now. If I could give a 1/2 star, I would move it up to 3.5 stars. Taking 1 1/2 away because you should not have these types of problems for a laptop that costs this much.</span>

While it has gotten just a little warm, I feel like that's to be expected with literally any gaming laptop on the market so I don't think I can knock it for that, especially when its been minimal.</span>

<span>Is a really thin and light laptop, the build materials and the style are clean and settle that add some points on being a powerful gaming laptop without screaming it. Having a Thunderbolt 4 port expands a lot of posibilities to eGPU if you want to add a more powerfull graphic card.<br/><br/>But some things to have in mind are i.e:<br/>- RGB is just one zone in the keyboard, it doesn't have indivitual lights for each letter<br/>- The 3060 is the 65W version so is not as powerfull at first glence if you are planning to game at really high setting or get the same performance from those benchmarks videos. Also to squeez the max from the GPU you have to set the profile to "Max perfomance" in the MSI Dragon Center if not it will limited to 40W and really you can see the diference.<br/>- The fan noise at max power can be a bit to loud but you can get use to and better a cold loud laptop that an quiet oven.<br/>- Minimun upgrability, you can upgrade the RAM but is a headache and the storage you have to remove the current M.2 to add a bigger one.<br/><br/>So far I'm happy with it and you will if accept these "buts"</span>

<span>Not gonna lie, super impressed with this laptop. Was considering an HP Spectre or Galaxy Book Pro, but stumbled across this on here of all places. It had everything i was looking for &amp; more than what I even realized.<br/><br/>Presentation in box was nice. Like how it is packaged in a dust sleeve &amp; even has a dust sleeve in-between screen &amp; keyboard. Major plus mark for that alone.<br/><br/>Upon booting first time &amp; getting initially set up, enjoyed how nice the screen is. IPS is the way to go, ngl. Keyboard light &amp; RGB options are a major upgrade for my use. Selection of apps &amp; programs from the get go are too numerous to mention, but is nice to have plenty of options. After removing what didn't interest me, proceeded with updates, as you should with any device.<br/><br/>This thing seems like Sonic... GOTTA GO FAST!<br/><br/>Dragon Center App has tons of various tweaks &amp; options for things like Keyboard RGB light, Power/ Battery, Performance, etc. Definite plus for that alone. Some people can't stand it, so I'll leave that up to particular preference.<br/><br/>Yes, the fans can he EXTREMELY NOISY... BUT for my particular usage &amp; wants in a laptop, quite a fair trade off. Only way they get THAT noisy, is if you select extreme performance/ cooler boost. A good pair of headphones would drown that noise.<br/><br/>Another surprise, is that you can run android games either through The appropriate MSI app or even Bluestacks... was not aware of when I decided to purchase, but cool nonetheless. I would say remove the MSI App Player &amp; just use true Bluestacks, if you want to mess with Amdroid emulation<br/><br/>With this, I plan on investing in Steam, finally. Not to mention, can't wait to see what this thing can handle, emulation-wise (Can't wait to try Stepmania on this). [Edit/ Update 9/7/21 -Stepmania runs just like arcade Dance Dance Revolution on MAX graphical program settings. Just a little side note, SOME games that have a max refresh rate of 60hz may have graphical issues... I'm specifically mentioning Sonic Adventure &amp; Adcenture 2 for PC being OVERLY FAST. There are workarounds to get said games working perfectly.]<br/><br/>Build seems solid. Got the Gray version &amp; am not disappointed at all by my choice. It has a nice blue tinit to it.<br/><br/>[Update 9/7/21- Dont expect to get a ton of battery use out of this thing. Setting battery saver settings via windows &amp; dragon center to as max as possible &amp; lowering screen brightness might get 6 to 8 hours of battery life, with just normal, no gaming computer use. Thankfully you can calibrate battery when needed to extend the service life of it.] [Another note: if you run demanding thinga in this, it will get hot to hold. My suggestion, buy a GOOD laptop stand with fan cooling. I would suggedt KLIM Ultimate RGB for if you are a gamer that plays less demaning games. Binding of Isaac, Emulation, etc. Said cooler would probably be good for some demanding games too, with Cooler Boost function turned on to help get some extra airflow]<br/><br/>This may be The best "budget" gaming laptop out there atm. Got the 512 GB Model with 16 GB ram &amp; the RTX 3060. Going to eventually go overkill with max ram &amp; a 2 tb Samsung SSD. Can't wait to see what this thing can unleash then... but for now, happy camper!</span>

<span>I've had this for about a month so I figured I'd make a review.  I travel a lot for work and do animation as a hobby.  I love the second screen.  The ability to have a tutorial on the second screen while having a major application open is a huge bonus.  This screen being touch sensitive is also i plus.  This laptop is also very compact for the power it has, and is as portable as any other full size laptop.  The only major complaint I have are the high pitched fans used to cool this laptop.  If you're doing anything apart from video streaming and browsing, headphones are a must.<br/><br/>Pros<br/>-High Quality primary screen.<br/>-Second screen (The convenience of the second screen is on par with a backup cam for a car.)<br/>-A large selection of ports<br/>-Portability (carrying this with me on work trips is leagues better than packing a desktop and screen.<br/><br/>Cons<br/>-Price (If you don't need a portable machine, you can build a more powerful desktop for a fraction of the price<br/>-Keyboard can be awkward (The lower keyboard is extremely awkward when used on your lap or at the edge of a small desk)<br/>-Fans (While great at keeping the laptop cool, headphones are an absolute must when doing any intensive tasks)</span>

<span>I have built my own computers since 1999.  I know what I want in them and how much it's gonna cost me.  I never buy the latest stuff, I keep it about a year old and has served me well.  But this time after a friend's advice I dove into the gamin laptop and am very pleased.  No it's not the legion 7 but it's new and has what I need.  Quick fire up, minimal bloat software, slapped in another 1 TB drive, created my local account, updated everything, loaded MW and I was off to the races.  Great machine.  I will be getting the 80 watt battery to give it the power boost it needs to really open it up.  Very happy.  We'll worth it and highly recommend.<br/><br/>8/23<br/>Quick update.  This laptop is great.  I have the HDR setting turned on with no issues.  4k will only run at 60 fps but the picture is outstanding and doesn't really task the processor or vid card.  I recommend the RAM upgrade.  It comes with 16 gig of ddr4 and is actually the sweet spot for most everything but boosting to 32 gig of ddr4 really gives it a lot more breathing room to perform.<br/>I would get a stand or something for airflow.  I love AMD but they are a hot runner compared to Intel.  But this thing does have an awesome cooling system as long as you've got the bottom vents unobstructed.  Heat is the enemy.<br/>Windows 11 is actually a very good OS.  I found a cheap metal stand that works perfect.  I work in Engineering IT and have delt with every os since win 95 so seen the good and the bad.<br/>Just my 2 cents and hope it helps some folks</span>

<span>I got this to use in my bedroom as a secondary gaming rig for the evening, what i didn't expect was that it would be so much better than my primary. I have a PC that isn't very old, with AM3+ 32gig/GTX1070 water cooled and i expected the laptop to be slightly below this in performance based on ratings, however the opposite is true. The laptop with ryzen far exceeds and in many cases double the FPS in many of the games i play on the same settings as my main rig. The 3050TI really shines with this processor, and the advanced sound controls really take it the rest of the way there. And the fans on this thing are impressive, it maintains low temps and you can feel the air really blasting out of the sides, and it's not nearly as loud as my main PC.<br/><br/> Since then i have made a docking station to replace my main PC now with this, and i use it for pretty much everything.<br/><br/> (I would heavily invest in a fan filter system if you have pets or you leave it running a lot as a docked pc)<br/>(I use the 1" thick do it yourself AC system filter available at any hardware store, as a pad underneath)</span>
