<span>The setting:<br/>My standards were the Enecfire G20, my first Bluetooth earbuds that do the job pretty well considering there less than 40 Dollars price point. But, I lost one of the tips and haven't been able to find a just as good fitting one.<br/><br/>The case:<br/>I bought a Google Pixel 6A, and decided to get the Pixel Buds A with it because it seemed a good pair, considering the same ecosystem.<br/><br/>The review:<br/>Sound quality is very good. Call quality is up to par, but not tremendously better than the 40 Dollar ones that I had before. Not being able to control the sound from touch control on the Buds is a bummer. But my biggest issue is with the fit. As you can see in the picture, it just doesn't lock in no matter how I twist it.<br/><br/>The build quality of the buds and the case are just as clean as it should be and that makes me love using them.<br/><br/>Conclusion:<br/>They are absolutely nice buds, but just not my perfect buds.</span>

<span>Love these headphones, they work great and the case is small which makes it very convenient. They can get a little uncomfortable if you wear them for a long time, but the battery life is amazing and they charge really fast.</span>

<span>The wired Google earphones were wonderful. One could tug the wire to make a perfect fit and never drop the earpiece. These buds have a little hook that is almost, but not quite, entirely unlike tea. They fall out. Often. Don't use these during maraton training. (If you have the spare time to train for marathons, you can afford not-falling-out models... Working stiffs, well...)<br/><br/>Oh, there's a locator function. It pops up a warning that the sound level could be harmful to the consumer's hearing. In practice, it is dang faint. Plan on triangulating in two-foot grids. Yeah, from the front seat to the back seat of the car was no-go.<br/><br/>As long as they stay in, yeah, they are sound delivery devices. This model doesn't have active noise suppression. This model is under $50 and noise-suppression models are ~$200. So. Not bad. Not outstanding. Good value for the money. No regerts [sic].</span>

<span>I really like how comfortable they are. I've tried other earbuds and have always had issues with the buds staying in place while I move around. These ones did not have that problem. Honestly the only thing I didn't like is that the battery life for the earbuds is a little short. In the end i was able to work around it by using one earbud at a time and swap them out as they charge and since I mostly use them at work I only use one at a time anyways so it's fine . If the battery life was a tad bit better I would rate 5 stars.</span>

<span>On Day 2.<br/><br/>These were pretty easy to install, but I had a few issues while I was trying to do a firmware update, so I had to reinitiate a couple of times.  The pairing mode is a bit different from what I've done in the past with other models. You have to have the case open and push a button in the back of the case to pair.<br/><br/>Still getting used to their functionality, but found the noise cancellation to be pretty good. I like the transparency mode - allows me to hear sounds in the background while optimizing the noise cancellation.<br/><br/>I bought these because I was having trouble hearing but not yet qualified for true hearing aids and thought they might help,  The jury is still out, but they do have the ability to put near the speaking person in noisy situations so looking forward to trying that feature out.<br/><br/>The equalizer is pretty good as well.<br/><br/>Battery life is questionable.  I've been using for a couple of hours when on full, down to 82% left/ 85% right.  Seems that when you use the touch controls, it uses a bit of battery power, as my left and right earbuds are at different % levels.<br/><br/>Google assistant always gives you the time  and any notifications. if you touch the bud and hold it there without asking any questions.<br/><br/>Would be nice to have the ability to configure this.<br/><br/>Overall, pretty solid so far</span>

<span>The sound on these are phenomenal. The added EQ makes them extremely usable and the audio spread from these guys are great.<br/><br/>The not so great is that they take a while getting used to. I thought these just wouldn't fit me or were too loose. After much trial and error and simply just getting used to them, they've been pretty comfortable to wear for long periods of listening.<br/><br/>Battery life is great. I've not worn them long enough in a session to kill the battery.<br/><br/>Noise cancelling is good enough with music to block a lot. Like to the point I don't realize someone has been talking to me for the past few minutes. (I have headphones in, I can't hear you)<br/><br/>Hear through is passable. But the nice feature is pulling a bud out, music pauses and whichever bud is in, turns to hear through. Done talking? Pop the other bud in, noise cancelling turns on, audio resumes and your on you're way. Awesome feature.<br/><br/>I would have given them 5 if the fit was comfortable right away. But the sound was too good to pass up. I couldn't return them because they simply sounded so good.</span>

<span>In addition to being a headphone addict, I was looking for another option for a quality set of  wireless NC ear buds for air travel.  Currently I use over-the-ear Sony WH1000XM (original V1) OR Bose Wired in ear QC20's.  Both sound good and have very good noise cancelling.  However, I wanted to reduce the bulk while traveling and have an option to go wireless as my new phone does not have an audio jack.  Enter this review, and my comparison between the Sony WF 1000XM4's and the Google Pixel Buds Pro (PBP).<br/><br/>In this review, I used a 0- or 1-point system with 1 point for the winner, 0 points for the loser and 1 point for each for a tie.<br/><br/>If you don't want to read through the comparison, just get the PBP's.  These two earbuds are very close in features, sound quality and noise cancelling, but the PBP's are cheaper and still beat out the Sony's based on my scoring...and I really love the Sony’s but cannot justify them for the price difference!<br/><br/>For my smaller ears the Sony's were a bit more uncomfortable. Ultimately both are really good ear buds, and it comes down to a matter of fit and price (at least for me).  If price is not an option and you have larger ears go with Sony, otherwise go with the Pixel Buds Pro.<br/><br/>Detailed review<br/>Price: Both were purchased on sale, so the Sony's were $250 (regularly $280) and the PBP's were $150 (regularly $199).  In my opinion, PBP's are a bargain compared to the Sony's!  Winner: PBP<br/><br/>Fit: PBP smaller and lighter.  Sony, foam tips seal well, but can be scratchy in the ear and feel hotter.  For my smaller ears the PBP's were just more comfortable. Winner: PBP<br/><br/>Noise Cancelling: Sony is better with NC and foam tips.  PBP's not far behind though. With proper ear tips, the Sony's will block out slightly more noise in air travel.  In the office, it is also close, but some of the higher pitched sounds will make it through on the PBP's.  Overall, it is pretty close given the cost difference between the two, and Sony's reputation for Noise cancelling. Winner: Sony<br/><br/>Bass -no/flat EQ: Both are bass heavy buds. Winner: Tie<br/><br/>Mid - no/flat EQ: Both have OK Mids. Sony's seem slightly more subdued, but both were pretty muddy without some EQ help.  The PBP's treble boost may also help the MIDs come out a little more but its too close to call. Winner: Tie<br/><br/>High - no/flat EQ: PBP have an accentuated high-range making music a little brighter but can get shrill.  The Sony's highs were a little dull making for an overall slightly subdued sound Winner: PBP<br/><br/>Overall sound no/flat EQ: Sony's sound slightly cleaner out of the box without the EQ, but the two are close.  They both need some EQ help to go from good to great sounding buds. Winner: Sony<br/><br/>Overall Sound W/EQ: With some EQ adjustments both can be closely matched.  Sony needs a treble bump, PBP's need treble reduced.  Both need the mid’s bumped slightly. Winner: Tie<br/><br/>Touch Controls: PBP has more controls available at once.  Both can be changed in the apps, but with Sony you must choose between music control or volume control.  The PBP's can do both with taps or swipes. Both will pause music when the earbuds are removed. Winner: PBP<br/><br/>Control feedback: Sony's have spoken audio queue's, PBP's use beeps.  Much easier to know what you changed with spoken responses by the Sony's. Winner: Sony<br/><br/>Volume level: At the same volume settings, the Sony's were louder.  For the PBP's it seemed I needed to play these near max volume.  Could be a phone issue, but all volume and app settings were the same for both. This bothered me enough to almost make me not want to keep the PBP's. Winner: Sony<br/><br/>Battery Life (ANC on): Sony's seem to have a slight edge, but only by a few minutes. Too close to call Winner: Tie<br/><br/>Charging: Both have USB C and Wireless charging and charge in approximately the same amount of time.  Number of charges and quick charging (5-minute charge for an hour of play) is the same per the specs. I have not tried this out yet as I always keep these charged. Winner: Tie<br/><br/>Multipoint (pairing): Sony does not allow you to pair and use with two Bluetooth devices at the same time.  The PBP's do. Shame on Sony for not including this for the price of these headphones. Great feature for office use! Winner: PBP<br/><br/>App: Both apps are well done.  The PBP app is a little easier to use. Both have ear tip check feature which will tell you if you ear tips are sealing well.  I used a smaller tip in one ear and both apps detected a bad seal. Winner: Tie<br/><br/>Charging Case size: Both are small, but the PBP's have slimmer case and feels better when carried in the pocket. Winner: PBP<br/><br/>Assistant features: Both are capable of using Google assistant or Alexa..Yes, the PBPs will work with Alexa Winner: Tie<br/><br/>Auto Ambient Switch: Only available on the Sony.  If it senses you are talking it will automatically switch to ambient sound pass through and pause your music.  Very useful feature and works well especially on an airplane.  However, if you like to sing out loud you probably want to disable this feature.  Winner: Sony<br/><br/>Find my headphones: Only available on the PBPs. You can send a signal and make the buds beep if you misplace them. Winner: PBP<br/><br/>Bluetooth: Both connect instantly and have great range.  Walking to the other side of my house and through about 3 walls, both ear buds cut out in the exact same location. Winner: Tie<br/><br/>Microphone: Did not really test this, based on the soundguys.com review they are close, but in their recorded audio the PBP's mic sounds a bit better to my ear than the Sony's. Winner: PBP<br/><br/>Total Score: Sony 13, Pixel Buds Pro 16</span>

<span>I'll start by saying I'm an audio engineer, and I have an addiction to headphones and earphones. I have a set for recording vocals, a set for recording instruments, IEMs for recording drums, IEMs for mixing on the go, over the ear for mixing in my home studio, another set of in-ears and another set of over-ear for pleasure listening at home and yet another set for travel. I must have well over 50 sets of earphones &amp; earbuds between my home and studio. There's simply no set that can do it all for me (yet). And that's a problem, because then I'm always looking.<br/><br/>Now, these earphones are not designed to be used as IEMs or for critical listening, but still, I must say, for the past few years, the earphones I've used the most, were the 2nd gen Pixel Buds. The integration with the assistant was superb, battery was acceptable (for me) and sound quality was above average. Sure, they will never beat the ATH-M50x but why would they? Still, the sum of their parts, was enough for them to be the ones I reached out to use the most (outside a studio environment).<br/><br/>Ordered these Pixel Buds Pro as soon as I could, and was disappointed in the sound quality. I found them to be less clear, more muddy. Bu the time I tested them, the EQ in the phone's settings was not yet available so I couldn't tune them at all (except for the "bass boost" that was offered as an "enhancement" through the app). But their transparency mode, which I've always enjoyed in earphones and headphones I've owned over the years that featured it, was simply the best I've ever heard. It's amazing and sometimes I need to go to the app just to verify if it's on because I'm tricked into thinking everything is perfectly transparent. The Assistant integration is as good as ever. Battery life is much improved and the buds themselves seem to fit better in my ears. On top of this, the multilink is perfect, as I believe most of us will switch between our computers and our phones on the daily, these do it seamlessly.<br/><br/>So everything was great, except for sound quality. Fortunately, I use PowerAmp for my music listening, so I could use the built in EQ. Eventually, the ANC, Transparency mode, Assistant and comfort meant I was reaching out for these instead of the old version more often than not.<br/><br/>A few months in, the custom EQ for the earbuds is now available through the pixel buds app, and while these still don't compare to most of my other earphones/headphones, they are now my most used because once again; the sum of its parts.<br/><br/>I'm giving them 4 stars overall, which I feel is well deserved. 5 stars on every aspect, and 4 stars on sound quality.</span>

<span>JBL has outdone themselves again with these earbuds. If I could give it 4.5, that is where it'd be.<br/><br/>Packaging:<br/>Right away the packaging is really nice. You see the earbuds on the back of the case along with all the features. The charging case for the ear buds has a nice matte black sheen to it. It's very compact making it super portable and it feels really smooth to hold too. The earbuds also have a (satisfying) neat magnetic clip when putting it back in the case so that's a cool plus from me. The instruction manual is also really user-friendly and has nice visuals of what tapping or a press-hold does. You get 2 different size earbud covers that aren't already on the earbuds themselves so there's S, M, and L--a standard for most JBL products. The last thing in the packaging is the tiny bright orange USB-C cable.<br/><br/>Sound:<br/>Like what it says on the front packaging: PURE BASS. That's what you get with these JBL earbuds. This is where they excel on, but not so much on the treble department. It's still good, don't get me wrong, but if it was a little higher without adjusting the EQ in-app, this would get that last star (with ANC). Having the right earbud suction thingies helps a lot so if you're not getting that right sound, try the different suction thingies they provide because these sound great.<br/><br/>Noise-cancelling:<br/>I'll talk about this really quick because this was apparently a feature that I had to rate on, but I give it 3 stars, but 3.5 sounds more like it. Having active noise cancelling would be a 5 star, but with the sound on half, you wash out most of what's going on around you with the sound quality.<br/><br/>Controls:<br/>Having physical buttons on these earbuds is the way to go compared to touch controls. You can do 1 earbud mode which reduces the amount of functions you have on the one working earbud, but hey, you can hear the rest of the world better. It works with all the assistants like Alexa, Carmen, Ollie, Google, and whoever else you use. With the physical buttons it's really easy to pause, play, skip, rewind, all of that good stuff.<br/><br/>Battery: I've used these for hours and hours and with the combination of having it charged in its case, I've never had the "battery low" warning. It has around 8 hours of playtime and with the case, it charges back to full in 2 hours. The case itself has supposedly 24 hours of charge on it, but I've never had to get to that amount of use.<br/><br/>I got these mainly for running since the bulky over-the-ear headphones got in the way of my hair blah blah so these minimal earbuds were a good replacement. The suction thingies were very useful and is probably why it stayed inside my ear the entire time. The fast pair function is really nice and right out of the box connected to my phone and laptop really quick.<br/><br/>Would I recommend these earbuds to others? Totally. For around $70, these earbuds are one of the best, long-lasting earbuds in this price range. It doesn't cure cancer, but it uplifts you with the sweet power of music.</span>

<span>Just to start off, I bought these to be my work horse earbuds so I don't wear out my Cambridge Audio Melomania Touch buds. The brand, price point, sound quality and battery life are what drew me to them and they definitely do not disappoint.<br/><br/>They sound good out of the box but do benefit from tuning them with a devices sound settings. They have great lows and mids but the highs need a little adjustment. Music and video content are terrific. I especially had a lot of fun watching Marvel movies while using these as the lows and mids really shine.<br/><br/>Call quality is great and the mic is funtional. People on the other end of a call had no trouble hearing me, just don't expect them to be perfect. They work and that is fine with me.<br/><br/>The battery life for these are amazing when connected to a phone/tablet but suffer a little when connecting to other bluetooth transmitters, such as a dongle attached to a ps4. Couldn't get the full 8 hours when used that way but a phone/tablet is spot on at 8 or more. This may be an issue with my equipment, not the earbuds.<br/><br/>They fit great in my ears and this is the first set of earbuds that fit perfectly out of the box without having to change out the ear tips. I can also wear these all day without ear fatigue which is a huge win in my book.<br/><br/>The physical buttons work well enough and are a nice change from the touch type. I suggest gripping them slightly with two fingers and using a third to press the buttons, as just pushing on them causes the ear tips to move deeper into the ear canal.<br/><br/>The earbuds connect very easy and quickly and switch between devices very seemlessly which is a great change from my very finicky Cambridge Audios.<br/><br/>The charge case is really great but my only gripe is that the spring in the hinge is a little on the weak side so the case closes just a tad too easy. Though, the case magnet is amazing for both the flap and the earbuds and everything stays in place very well, even when accidentally dropped.<br/><br/>Now to the major issue I have is with JBL, not the buds themselves. JBL has made it a habit of not supporting a lot of their audio products and this model unfortunately isn't supported for their audio app. I have 3 different pairs of earbuds; Reflect, Live and Tune models and none of them are supported so there are no extra features or customizations available. The silver lining is that these earbuds just work right out of the box and won't require any software updates that could potentially ruin them in the future.<br/><br/>In conclusion, these are not your high end, high spec, feature rich earbuds that run over $200+ and are not really designed to be. They are solid, well made and incredibly functional. I picked them up for $60 on sale but feel that they would be worth the full $99 to anyone looking for a set of buds that will last and do the job.<br/><br/>Features missing for anyone interested:<br/><br/>-No noise canceling, only noise isolating due to the design of the ear tips going into the ear canal.<br/><br/>-No app support. Why JBL?<br/><br/>-Since no app support, no firmware updates which can be viewed as a good thing<br/><br/>-No ear wings to keep them in place, though I have not had them just fall out while talking, eating, smiling etc. Did not test them while working out/running.<br/><br/>-No transparency mode. If you want to hear things around you or have a conversation without hearing yourself inside your head, take one or both of them out.<br/><br/>-No noise cancellation for phone calls (the feature some buds have that clean up/isolate your voice and filter out background noise).<br/><br/>Again, the lack of these features to me did not come into play when purchasing and can be done without at this price point. Just wanted to make sure others knew before buying as there are other less expensive earbuds out there that are more feature rich but suffer from simple things like sound quality, ear fit and connectivity. Thank you for reading!</span>

<span>This product is of GQ. Think of anything you’ll need on an EarPod and you’ll get it here. JBL has done a great work on producing this well engineered product with quality sound, noise cancellation and battery life. I’m not a heavy user of EarPods but I spend not more than  2hrs each day using it. I probably charge the outer case once in a month.</span>

<span>Overall these earbuds met my expectations. Great sound quality, great battery life, small compact sturdy carrying case, smooth connection, fit comfortably for long periods of time. Personally I really like that the side control buttons on the earbuds are physical buttons rather than touch controls.<br/><br/>With the side control buttons you can perform the following actions:<br/>Next Song - 1 press left<br/>Previous  - 2 press left<br/>play/pause - 1 press right<br/>accept/end call - 1 press right<br/>siri/google assist/bixby - 2 press right<br/>You can also just use only the right or left earbud in mono mode and then 1 press will be play/pause and 2 press siri...<br/><br/>Cons<br/>These earbuds are not on the list of supported devices for the JBL headphones app so you won't be able to do any EQ customization or personalization.<br/><br/>There are no way to change volume with the buttons which would have been nice to see. The one time I've found this to be a headache is when using the earbuds with my Samsung smart tv which didn't allow me to change the volume of the earbuds from the remote or settings. Unfortunately there doesn't seem to be way around this because these earbuds are not supported on their app.</span>

<span>These are pretty uncomfortable in my ears, maybe because I have somewhat smaller ears...<br/><br/>I have been using them to listen to podcasts when I'm running errands or at the gym, phone calls while driving, and listening to binaural beats and meditation for focus and sleep. They kind of start to hurt after maybe 20 minutes or so, and it's not possible to use them in bed for long since I'm a side sleeper and can't fall asleep on my back.<br/><br/>The left earbud tends to fall out sometimes out of nowhere, perhaps that ear is a little larger than my right? But I'm not sure how to replace the ear pieces to try a larger one, it feels like I'm going to break it, considering the price of these I'm just trying to be more aware of how that one feels in my ear.<br/><br/>I'm a little disappointed with the hear through setting, which I prefer over ANC unless I'm meditating or listening to something to help with sleep. It seems like sometimes it automatically switches to ANC. I honestly haven't paid any attention to the ANC quality cause it's not my preference.<br/><br/>Phone calls mostly seem to come in clearly though I do struggle to hear people sometimes even at top volume, but I assume it has something to do with the other person's phone.<br/><br/>I have noticed some interference when I walk through detectors, like at my school library, and today while I was talking to my sister while shopping for shoes for my niece I noticed whatever frequency it was at made the theft protection devices chirp if I got too close. That was kind of funny but didn't really bother me.<br/><br/>I have gone running with these in once and they didn't fall out, even the left one, but since then is when the left one started falling out on occasion and I haven't tried since then.<br/><br/>Overall I probably wouldn't purchase these again because of how uncomfortable they are, they were not worth the price to me.</span>
