<span>This Chromebook would have been great, but it wouldn't recognize my WiFi nor my time zone. So if you live in Eastern Standard Time, you might want to get another unit.</span>
</span></div></em></blockquote>
<p> </p>
<blockquote><em><div class="a-row a-spacing-small review-data"><span class="a-size-base review-text review-text-content" data-hook="review-body">
<span>I was shocked at how snappy and decent this little Chromebook is. For the price you really can't beat it. My Father's Acer R-13 stopped working so I ordered this one for him. It setup immediately and even recognized his USB dock which allowed him to connect wireless mouse, keyboard and speakers. This is a great deal. I'll update if he runs into any issues with it in the future, but so far it's a 5 star winner.</span>

<blockquote><em><div class="a-row a-spacing-small review-data"><span class="a-size-base review-text review-text-content" data-hook="review-body">
<span>This is my first Chromebook, and I've been using it for two days.  The battery life is amazing so far; it does appear to be 10 hours. Reading the reviews, it seems like a wide range of experiences, and I feel fortunate that mine works well so far.<br/><br/>It was very easy to set up. I saw 11.5 in the description, but the actual display screen is 10 inches. It isn't a touch screen, and the keys are dark gray, not black. This was an impulse purchase after getting a new laptop a few days ago. My 6 year old Dell would work no longer, and I got an expensive gaming laptop. It was my second one, but I was not expecting it to get so hot, with a noisy fan. The battery life is about an hour. To feel more comfortable, I wanted a Chromebook for email, YouTube, and Amazon videos. So, this is doing what I want it to.<br/>I will likely get more used to having no delete key, instead the alt+backspace key is used for that function.  I was surprised when my bookmark bar appeared with bookmarks from 2013 on. I've deleted many of them in the bookmark manager.<br/>My main dissatisfaction is the disappearing vertical scroll bar. In some emails, you can select "view in<br/>browser". I would be more frustrated if I didn't have the laptop available. There might be a fix for that; I haven't researched yet.<br/>I purchased mine when it was 52% off, which is worth it.  Buying electronics is risky. I've been very disappointed in the past, which is why I'm relieved and accepting of the machine I got.<br/>Almost everything has become more expensive, and reasonable expectations seem to be in order. With two days use, I'm not regretting my purchase.</span>

<span>My job is entirely Google based.  I bought this as a second work computer because my company laptop is a Thinkpad and it's heavy.  I just wanted to leave that at home and have a nice sleek backup for any work tasks I'd need to do in a pinch out of the house.  I couldn't be more pleased with this.  It's light, fast, and the battery life is fantastic.  Lenovos are known for having great keyboards and this is the best one I've used on a small laptop.  It also doesn't look or feel cheap.  The only thing that shows 'budget' is the screen, as it won't blow you away.  But it's still very solid and surprisingly good from the side, where most screens in this price range are garbage viewed from an angle.  If you are in the market for a laptop, and you are in the probably 95% of the public that absolutely doesn't really need an $800 laptop for what they use it for, rush out and buy this one while the price is still insane.</span>

<span>I've recently taken up 3D printing and saving files to an SD card on my 8 yr old laptop with a broken screen was a pain. I like this lil laptop. It's been pretty easy to use. I did take it back to the windows 10 because thats what I'm used to using and so much easier to use and navigate. I use this Asus laptop for my 3D model searching, slicing 3D model's in several apps, I was able to connect it to 1 of my 3D printers and successfully printed model's, I've used it for my Cricut machine with design space. I've used it to watch Amazon prime, Netflix, and YouTube videos (I do have to connect a Bluetooth speaker). I've done file transfers from my phone to the laptop. I would not say this is a gaming laptop, but my son did try it out for a couple of games and liked it. It does not have a touch screen, which is a disappointment. It charges fairly quickly and holds a charge for a long time. 1 issue with the built in number pad in the mouse pad, it keeps turning on and then can't get it to turn off for a while. It's pretty touchy. It is very lightweight and portable. Something a college student could fit into a backpack.</span>

<span>I'm giving this little engine that could five stars. Why? Well, it's two hundred dollars. So I'm reviewing it as a two hundred dollar product. If I was comparing it to a Macbook Air M1, it would probably be three stars. If I was comparing it to a Microsoft Surface, three and a half. But it's a small, budget laptop, and in that category, it's excellent.<br/><br/>QUICK RUNDOWN - It blows my mind how good of a job they did with this. I've used a lot of computers, and this one impresses me. If you've ever had a Chromebook, or even just a cheap (or perhaps even more expensive) laptop you'll feel the difference immediately. It has a few issues, none of which are deal breakers, but it has many, many pros. Read on.<br/><br/>PROS --<br/>Incredible Price to Performance Ratio<br/>Very well built, with no cheap parts<br/>Full-size, comfortable keyboard<br/>Small and lightweight<br/>Good design (add stickers if it's a little too plain for you)<br/>Full Windows 10 License, and no hardwired bloatware<br/>Internal NVMe slot and external SD Card slot<br/>I could keep going... it's $200.<br/><br/>CONS --<br/>No backlight keyboard (at least on the 11.6 model)<br/>Some irksome viewing angle problems<br/>Maddeningly little built in storage<br/>Almost too little RAM<br/>Realtek Wifi Card (explained why in the 'Linux' section)<br/><br/>I've divided the review into individual sections: webcam, speakers, performance, software, etc, so scroll down to the one that's most important to you, or read the review from top to bottom. They are (in order):<br/><br/>Introduction (above)<br/>Weight &amp; Build<br/>Keyboard and Trackpad<br/>Screen<br/>Battery<br/>Performance (including Gaming)<br/>Webcam<br/>Speakers &amp; Sound<br/>Software<br/>Linux<br/>Other (SD Card Slot, NVMe slot, HDMI output, heating, cleaning)<br/>Conclusion<br/><br/>Let me start with a few disclaimers. First, I've only been using it for a few weeks, which is about enough time to get a good sense of its mettle and iron out any problems it has. There's been a few things I've noticed that I've added to this review, (see 'performance' and 'screen') and I'll add more if more arise. No problem has been significant enough that it made me in any way wonder if it was worth. $200 is a really good price point.<br/><br/>The second disclaimer, is there's a few reviewers saying either A, they got a dud, or B, it clunked out on them after two years. Duds happen, with any product, this is no exception. So if mine does decided to go on the fritz, I'll update my review relative to the exchange process - I WON'T deduct stars *just* because it gave out. Second, if you get two years of solid use out of this, it's a good product. Just buy another one.<br/><br/>With that being said, let me get into the details.<br/><br/>WEIGHT AND BUILD - This is one of its greatest strengths, and rivals many laptops in higher price ranges. There's no creaks, no cheap plastic waiting to shatter, it's not a flimsy toy. It's a solid electronic. It feels right, in your hands, on your lap, on a desk. So many laptops try and woo you with larger screens or better specs [or, for the life of me, a lower price tag], and turn out to be cup coasters you have to plug in. Not this. It really feels like it has some life in it.<br/><br/>It's not obscenely light, like a MacBook Air, but you can move about and use it on your lap without strain. If traveling's your kind of thing, then the weight is sufficient. I would feel comfortable carrying it through an airport.<br/><br/>The screen hinge feels durable and like it won't be breaking anytime soon, and when you set it at the position you like, it stays. The laptop isn't super-ultra-mega thin, but it is thin, and that's a nice bonus. You could probably fit it in an envelope, just maybe a slightly larger envelope then the one Steve Jobs used.<br/><br/>KEYBOARD AND TRACKPAD - The keyboard, I'm in love with. It's full size; no cramping on tiny keys or accidentally presses. The give is decisive and gratifying, and it just feels good to use. The keyboard is actually the one (literally, the only one) thing I feel they cut a little too close to the corner on. There's no backlight. It appears as those some of the models have a backlight, though I'm not sure, but mine doesn't. (I got the 11.6 model). This can be a little frustrating, and I'm considering getting a book light so I can type in the dark. Again, this is a two hundred dollar laptop, so it is what it is. I'll make due.<br/><br/>Another note, is they put the 'delete' key right next to the power key. Shucks. A few times, I've gone to press the delete key, and the computer goes into sleep mode. This is more of an inconvenience than anything. Just press the power button again and it will start right back up where you left off. Still, if you're doing sensitive work, it's something to consider, and I'm sure you'll learn very quickly to be cautious.<br/><br/>Also, the 'enter' key is green. I thought this was strange, but I really like it. Hard to explain.<br/><br/>The trackpad is responsive and that click is also decisive and gratifying. I don't have any issues accidentally pressing it while I'm typing, and it's very good at doing what I expect it to. If I click or tap, the mouse clicks. If I click on the right, it right clicks. Scrolling is painless and intuitive and very nuanced. The numpad on the keyboard is a nice touch, though I would have traded it for a backlit keyboard.<br/><br/>SCREEN - Going back to where we started, this is a two hundred dollar laptop. You're not getting an Apple Retina display. It has some minor viewing angle problems you'll have to accommodate for. If you're looking directly at it, everything looks good - pure colors, no whitening. If you turn it horizontally or bend the screen back, there's a noticeable change in tone. It is what it is, and it likely won't interfere with your work. Just don't do color grading for professional photoshoots on it.<br/><br/>The screen resolution is just right. The screen is small, but there's enough room to do what you want and then some. This is one of the most significant factors in comfort. If it were cramped, it would give you a headache and strain your eyes. But they did a good job of making sure there's some breathing room with a healthy buffer zone around whatever it is you're focusing on. You feel like you can move and engage in multiple things.<br/><br/>There's a few reviews complaining it's not a touch screen. You can't please everyone. It's not something I feel is missing, especially for $200.<br/><br/>BATTERY - The battery life is on point. The time remaining Windows estimates seems to vary quite a bit, but I watched two movies and used it for 4 hours, and still had 17%. It's the kind of thing you can charge at night and it will last you the day under normal conditions. It also doesn't have quick charge, another little cut corner, but I'm not stressing about it. Then again, I'm around a power outlet most of the time. If quick charge is an issue for you, you're in the wrong price point.<br/><br/>Side note: the charging port really plugs in. You have to give it a little oomph to pull it out. Which can be a pro and a con. You definitely don't want to trip on the cord; the whole thing will go flying off the table. But you can reposition the device without having to worry about the cord falling out.<br/><br/>PERFORMANCE - This is actually one of its biggest strengths, and really surprised me. All the components come together to create a seamless experience. I was nervous about the odd named Intel Processor (N6 something something) but it turns out, it's actually an Intel Celeron. And only four gigs of memory? Doesn't seem like quite enough. But it somehow manages to muscle out the minimum, and have some left over. My guess is, this is largely due to the SSD. Just a few years ago, laptop manufacturers had two options for storage: a physical hard drive, which was expensive, bulky, and a power drain, or some sort of memory like a thumb drive. Both were slow and huge bottle necks.<br/><br/>Well, this thing has a Solid State Drive. And that makes all the difference. With a decent processor, just enough memory, and the SSD, it will breeze through any routine task you ask it to do: open Microsoft Word, surf the web, torrent files, play music, and it will do it all without a hitch. Performance, under reasonable conditions, should never be a problem: you'll never feel a pause or get frustrated.<br/><br/>I LOVE the original Warhammer: 40K: Dawn of War series. This plays it effortlessly, even with mods. Which is very welcomed. I can imagine it can also play Sins of a Solar Empire, Age of Empires, Among Us, Terraria, and maybe even Minecraft, if that's your kind of thing. Check out GOG.com (great old games) and you'll be surprised at what's out there. If you are planning to do some light gaming, the NVMe slot will really come in handy.<br/><br/>IMPORTANT EDIT: After using it for some weeks, the lack of RAM is starting to become an issue. Windows has done a good job managing memory, but even day-to-day tasks can overwhelm it. This expresses itself as stalled applications, dropped Chrome tabs, or even system notifications that the system has run out of Memory. It did reach a significant error, though - everything went black, and after a reboot, Windows wanted to help set up my system (which is a big error.) Luckily everything was intact, my files, settings and programs. So it's just kind of a startling headache.<br/><br/>I was running a few programs, nothing too demanding. So if you're planning on using this for anything more then Spotify and Chrome, be forewarned.<br/><br/>WEBCAM - The webcam is about what you would expect. It's a hefty 0.3 megapixels, but there aren't any dropped frames, and the color processing is alright. If you need a webcam on the fly, it'll due. If you use a webcam for any serious purposes, I would suggest investing in a nice one, which you were probably going to do anyway. The device will be able to handle it without issue.<br/><br/>Of special note, is the microphone, which is actually great. Audio comes through clear and audible, distinct and focused. If you do find yourself in a situation where you have to use the onboard webcam, the video quality won't be great, but you won't have any problem being heard and understood.<br/><br/>SPEAKERS &amp; SOUND - The speakers are placed under the device, pointing directly down. You would think this would make them impossible to hear, but it projects and doesn't distort the sound. I've watched a few movies, and haven't had an issue hearing them - it gets plenty loud. I'm a bit of an audiophile, (though there are many more advance then I), and what I can say about these speakers is they're passable. They're not so bad that you're getting irked with the sound quality, but they're not so good you would enjoy Beethoven's 5th. The various aspects of sound - the bass, and whatever else the other parts are called, are balanced and clear.<br/><br/>If you're using it for casual media use, the lackluster sound quality will fade into the background and you'll be able to enjoy whatever it is you're doing.<br/><br/>The headphone amplifier is decent and it appears they didn't skimp on it. I tested it with a pair of Sony MDR7506s (which are one-for-one studio monitors with a higher than average impedance.) The amplifier didn't quit reach optimal levels, but it produced clear and pleasing sound. (and it does have a nice kick to it.) For an onboard amplifier, it's more then adequate. If you're a real audiophile and use an external amplifier, the primary factor to consider is if the sound it's putting out can be boosted, and it definitely can.<br/><br/>SOFTWARE - There's a few pieces of bloatware you'll want to uninstall. McAfee, Skype, MyAsus. (if you don't know what bloatware is, ask the techy in your family to remove it for you.) Fortunately, none of them are hard coded into the software or hardware, so uninstalling them is straight forward and simple and can be done through 'Add or Remove Programs.' The laptop does come in Windows S mode (which is suppose to be a simpler version of Windows, but has some bothersome limitations for power users.) They made it extremely easy to convert into regular Windows 10. I clicked a button once and haven't had to worry about it since: full Windows 10.<br/><br/>LINUX - I'm not a super user when it comes to Linux. I do know enough to install and use it on a day-to-day basis, and for low-performance computers like this one, Linux is tantalizing. Unfortunately, the WiFi card in the system [as of 11/19/21] doesn't work with Linux and there doesn't seem to be any support on the horizon. Most people who need or prefer Linux have taken to using a USB WiFi antenna, an untenable inconvenience for most. Some people have been reporting switching out the NIC entirely, but I don't know enough to speak about that.<br/><br/>OTHER - What I find really helpful is the SD Card Slot. The 64 gigs of storage it comes with goes REALLY quick. I like to watch, uh, documentaries in public domain (like 'Joker' with Joaquin Phoenix). It's amazingly simple to plug in an SD card (I got a 256gb one for $45), set up uTorrent to load all the unfinished and finished torrents onto the card, and that solves the whole problem. Just about any SD card you buy will be fast enough to download movies and play one at the same time.<br/><br/>Other reviewers have pointed out it comes with a slot for an NVMe SSD. If you don't know what that is, it probably doesn't make much of a difference. If you do, it's a very helpful addition. Hooray.<br/><br/>It has tons of ports, which is great. Two USB ports, a USB-C port, the above mentioned SD card slot, an auxiliary port, and an HDMI port. I've used the HDMI port on a full screen TV, and it works for watching a movie. The quality of the movie file will make a difference - but the sound compression changes that are necessary with downloaded media [generally done through VLC] help a lot. It's not blu-ray, but performance doesn't seem to be affected by what's happening in a scene or the amount of sound.<br/><br/>If you're planning on using this for presentations, it's exactly what you want. Plug, play 'n forget.<br/><br/>During normal, unplugged, use you wouldn't be able to tell that it's turned on just by the heat. If you're running a process-intensive program or have it plugged in, it does heat up, but that's normal. You can use it on your lap without a worrying. I don't see heating being an issue. It's also fanless, which is a big deal if you live in a dusty environment. You won't slowly be running it into the ground just by using it, listening to the fan whir louder and louder as it tries to compensate for all the dust.<br/><br/>Side note: If it overheats, it'll just turn off. It won't hurt it.<br/><br/>I like to take good care of my computers, so ease of cleaning matters to me. Being fanless, that alleviates a lot of of the issues you would come across. Still, you can't access behind the keyboard, so it will be interesting to see how that plays out. You might be able to remove each key and clean it out, which would go a long way, but I wouldn't try it without doing some research and carefully weighing the benefits and risks.<br/><br/>Either way, do yourself a favor: buy a small pack of Q-tips, a little bottle of house hold cleaner (Pinesol works well), and lens clothes, and throw them in the bag or case you're carrying the laptop in. Occasionally go over the keyboard with the Q-tips and wipe down the exterior, and the lens cloth will come in handy a lot more then you think. I don't know if it will necessarily add to the life of the machine, but it will feel a lot better. And it's worth taking some pride in your devices.<br/><br/>CONCLUSION - The bottom line is, is it feels good to use. Everything from the keyboard to the performance to the build quality makes it a very enjoyable and complete experience: there's nothing really lacking that will get in your way. It's spectacular for day-to-day use, and it's got a little muscle to it. For $200, you're getting a real product, and it even has something to say to higher end laptops. If you decide to go with this, I think you'll be very pleased.</span>

<span>I got this to log my collectibles and maybe make some PowerPoint presentations about them. For those uses, it’s acceptable. If you’re looking for a hard working computer keep looking. Obviously it’s not a high powered gaming rig so don’t expect speed or anything, but for basic tasks like running office programs and maybe organizing files it’s sufficient, if a little slow. It’s also small, which was what I was specifically looking for without having chrome os, so it doesn’t have great visuals. But it is clear enough to work with. For what it is, it is great, I took a star off though because it doesn’t hold a charge, even when powered off. I mainly work with it plugged in and always let it get to 100% before I shut it down and unplug it. But it dies after a day or two of being shut off, which makes it forget the Wi-Fi and it takes a few restarts to get it fixed. I don’t use it daily so I usually leave it powered down, I just wish it would have power when I need it again. So, if you’re looking for a small portable netbook that can run Microsoft office programs and do basic things, this isn’t a bad choice for the price, just be ready to work near an outlet.</span>

<span>I wish I didn't gift this to my 11 yo, lol!! It is such an awesome little machine. Great screen quality for picture and clarity, even side viewing. She plays Roblox on it and Toca Boca World - it runs all other apps perfectly and way better than my IdeaPad 3 (2022) - that's the difference in price points. We use this for homeschooling, gaming (as mentioned above) and general viewing apps such as Netflix, Disney+ and of course Amazon browsing. The touchscreen is worth the price point. Still has a few more years of Chrome OS updates.</span>

<span>Overall, I would say the laptop is great. It is definitely worth the price of around $300. It is small, lightweight (although could be more), responsive, looks great, smells new after months, smooth to use, track pad is pretty good,<br/>overall good chromebook.<br/>I'm not really too much of a Tech person but grew up with computers in my 20's mostly using it for school and personal stuff.<br/><br/>I had it for a few months now so my beginning concerns aren't the same as my latter ones. I'll try to go over really quickly the basic beginning concerns I had then go through with my impressions with months of use later on. 1366 X 768 isn't HD but it's acceptable. Processing speed is 2.1 ghz, never had a problem or issue with lags. 4 gb ram is okay, probably wouldnt do 2 gb. 11.6 screen, I wanted something smaller so this is a plus to me. Bit heavy with 2.64 lbs for a small laptop but it's okay, still my lightest one. internet connection is good and bluetooth use was good. Processor never had a problem with Mediatek. Convertible to tablet mode is a plus. Solid state so processes quickly which is a big plus. Battery life is great, I hate charging and finding an outlet, but this goes on for more than 8-10 hours, just doing school stuff, no videos. I would say I searched like crazy in the beginning. I wanted one main personal laptop and one small convertible laptop and this was the best convertible one I could find on Amazon. I compared like 20+ laptops over a week, I was really putting a ridiculous amount of time on it. But I had specific things I wanted in mine, like speed, aesthetics, smooth performance, and valued those more than other things. I wanted things to be really convenient.<br/><br/>I have started using chromebooks more because they are inexpensive and very convenient to use. They aren't too good for hardcore processing, but for school work or personal work, it meets all my needs. Whenever I use it, everything is pretty smooth and seamless. Start and shut down are almost instant. I have never had an issue with it's use so far. I think for me, the biggest plus is the elegance. It makes everything very easy to use, it looks great, it even retains its new smell after some months with light use. My other laptops have poor track pads but this one is infinitely better. I don't feel the need to use a wireless mouse as well. I ended up getting a screen protector for it for almost $20 because it was a touch screen. I like how it has a lot of features like hdmi cables, one usbs, even a memory card slot. I think for the price, it is definitely worth it. It feels like a very high end chromebook, although I generally wouldn't pay too much for a laptop in general because I don't need high processing. The buttons feel nice and smooth. There hasn't been much lag or delay time. Updates are easy and smooth. Screen is nice to look at and the colors are great. There doesn't seem to be much glare and it feels aesthetically pleasing. Yeah everything's really nice with this.<br/><br/>There are some things I don't like about it though. Originally, I had planned to use this as a tablet part-time because I didn't want to buy paper textbooks. I thought of using all of it on this chromebook, but it turned out to not be convenient because it was too heavy. I would use it on the train and my hands would almost immediately get tired trying to read. I would have to rest is down on myself, which isn't a big deal but wanted something I could read ebooks and pdfs on conveniently. I don't know if I will end up getting another one to serve that purpose. It also is a chromebook so it cannot download files and stuff. I don't particularly like that because that stops it from being my main computer. I don't like putting personal stuff on my drive, like my expenses or whatever even though it is irrational and I do it with some apps. Maybe I should, but the fact that everything is on my drive to see makes me feel a bit uncomfortable. I don't mind that this computer cannot really do much without internet because I always have something saved on it. It has 64 gb of memory which I think is quite significant. I mean, if I couldn't put anything on the drive, I wouldn't feel that, but 64 gb + drive storage seems more than enough and I am trying to be a minimalist anyway. Yeah not that many cons.<br/><br/>Anyway, I wanted a inexpensive laptop but this definitely performs up to par with most laptops. Never had a problem with it so far months into my purchase but did want something I could use as a tablet. Would definitely recommend. Definitely better than a lot of the stuff I grew up with that cost 3x more. Best laptop I could find and really pleasantly surprised overall in many areas.</span>

<span>I'm far from a computer expert. I bought this computer for work because my job requires me to use a couple of different specific software programs. I needed a computer with a lot of storage, a fairly large screen, a numerical keypad, and most importantly, a cheap price tag. This computer has all of those things. I don't do any gaming or anything really sophisticated on it. Just work and some internet browsing. It boots up quickly and has been running smoothly so far. My biggest complaint is that it came with a lot of Microsoft bloatware that I hadn't experienced on my other laptops and by default it uses your Microsoft OneDrive for storage instead of the computer's SSD. The first time I logged onto the computer it asked me to either sign up for a Microsoft account or login to an existing one. My job requires me to take a lot of photos, so I was saving my photos to the computer without realizing it was uploading to my cloud storage account. That was an annoyance because I had to figure out how to switch that off. I unintentionally used up all of my cloud storage space because I didn't realize the system was set up that way. Once I figured out how to fix it, I was good to go. Also, the computer essentially comes in a "safe mode" which limits a lot of what you can do. It is designed for you to only use apps from the Microsoft app store and not download any software from any other source. It can be turned off, but it is another annoyance. I feel like they were trying to make it like their version of a Chromebook, but that makes it just as annoying as a Chromebook. Overall, it is a great computer once you get past all the Microsoft stuff.</span>

<span>Great laptop for the price, I don't think you can find a laptop this great at this price point. Appearance looks great, great build quality, keyboard does not at all feel cheap at all and the keyboard backlight is a great touch. Very lightweight. Touch pad is large and responsive. I have not tried the fingerprint scanner yet. Decently fast boot up times given it has an SSD. Battery life is actually pretty great, too. I am happy with the ports, it even has a USB C port. Screen gets very bright.<br/><br/>It also took about 5 minutes to put in an 8GB ram stick in the easily accessible and open ram slot.<br/><br/>Some cons of course since this is a budget laptop (these cons can be considered "normal" at this price point):<br/> - Full HD display with 1080P screen, however the color quality, especially blacks and other colors is not great. It feels like white is overwhelming compared to other colors. But otherwise at this price point it is OK in my opinion, just that there is a very noticeable difference compared to my 700 dollar laptop.<br/>- CPU kind of sucks. I added 8 GB of ram which did make the computer faster, but downloading things or loading times can be slow with the CPU being the issue. However it is tolerable and I am overall happy with the speed for this price point and do not feel I have to crutch on my other high end laptops.<br/>- The acer 5 series is usually marketed as "slim", but this laptop is definitely not slim. It isn't bulky though, I think it is very average or more in thickness compared to actual slim laptops on the market.<br/><br/>If you have 330 dollars only to spend and are on a tight budget, don't hesitate to get this laptop. If you do purchase this laptop, I would DEFINITELY recommend adding additional ram (I got 8GB ram for 25 bucks at microcenter) since it is super easy to upgrade the ram in this computer, and it made a noticeable difference in browsing, loading, scroll speeds. If you have an additional 100 dollars more to spend, I would go ahead and purchase a more expensive laptop for a better screen, and the next price-tier laptops usually have additional ram.</span>

<span>I would just like to note that this model only has one RAM slot, not two, as the Q&amp;A answers from Acer have stated. I purchased two 16GB modules on the basis that I would be able to take out the 4GB module and then put the two new ones in, giving me 32GB total. However when you take the back cover off, there is only one RAM slot on the motherboard. I don't mean one FREE ram slot, just one slot, period. It's empty, which means I was able to put one of the 16GB modules in, making for a total of 20GB, which isn't bad, but it's annoying to do your due diligence and read everything you can about a product, including statements from the manufacturer, only to find that the reality is different. My guess is that earlier models did in fact have two RAM slots, but since Amazon mixes models together on the same product page, it can be impossible to know exactly which model someone is talking about. Whatever, it is what it is, just know that this particular model A515-46-R3UB only has a single RAM slot. I don't even know where the other 4GB module is, maybe soldered onto the motherboard elsewhere, but I looked everywhere and I couldn't see any other places to put a second RAM module. I'm not a computer expert by any means, but I am a software developer and I have built my own PC from motherboard up, so I know what a RAM slot looks like. This only has one, so be warned.<br/><br/>The other thing that bugged me about this was the arrangement for inserting a 2.5 hard drive. In my case I wanted to put a 4TB Samsung SSD, which fit just fine into the frame, and then you screw the frame into the case, which is fine. The bad part is the little, itsy bitsy ribbon cable that have to connect the hard drive to the motherboard. First, I had to look up a youtube video to even know what I needed to look for on the motherboard. It's a tiny little slot covered with a white rubber cover, which you lever up, and then slide the end of the ribbon cable into it. The problem is, there's no positivity to the connection, like you have with the larger size regular SATA cables. No "click", because the cable is just a flexible, thin piece of plastic. There's not even any way to really know if it's aligned correctly. So you just fiddle around with it, not knowing if you're damaging the flimsy thing as you try to push it into a slot which gives you zero tactile feedback. After many attempts to insert it, only to feel it lift away without any resistance (meaning it hadn't inserted at all), eventually I got it to "stay", though it wasn't quite straight, that was as good as I could get it. Horrible design, if you ask me. I don't see that they couldn't have made the port a "real" one, there was plenty of height inside the case to be able to accommodate it. But again, whatever.<br/><br/>Finally, I wanted to put Debian on here, since I assumed that the latest version would work with the hardware. Not so much. The Wifi hardware in particular just would not work at all, even with Bullseye. And when I tried putting unstable on there, it stopped dead during install asking me to supply a number of firmware files which appeared to be related to the Wifi hardware, but I couldn't find those files anywhere online. Very frustrating.<br/><br/>Eventually I ended up installing Ubuntu instead, which isn't ideal since I like my development environment to be the same as my server, which is Debian. But I decided to try it, since I know that Ubuntu tends to do a better job with strange hardware drivers. Sure enough, it went without a hitch this time, and the wifi worked.<br/><br/>So now I have an Ubuntu laptop with a 4TB SSD and 20GB RAM, and it seems ok so far, so I'll probably keep it since other options out there seem to have their own issues - either the screen is bad, or the keyboard, or whatever, there's always something. At least this laptop seems to have a nice screen, the keyboard isn't too bad, and 20GB, while not what I wanted, should be enough to do what I want in reality. The webcam seems a little grainy, but I'm not a big webcam user anyway, so.<br/><br/>All in all it's a pretty good deal, if you know what you're going to have to deal with and are willing to fiddle around a bit. The one RAM slot, tiny trashy hard drive cable, and driver issues with Linux (at least the Wifi), everything can be worked around to some extent. I guess it just depends what you are willing to put up with.<br/><br/>I was thinking about posting a photo of the motherboard to show the single RAM slot, but it's all screwed back together now (11 tiny screws) so to be honest I can't be bothered. Just take my word for it, there's just the one RAM slot, not two as all the Q&amp;A seem to say. Be warned.</span>

<span>This is my first Chromebook, and overall I’m quite pleased with the purchase.  I’m mainly going to be using it for basic internet browsing and writing, so when I was shopping for the right model I was favoring cost, weight and battery life over other features like screen size and processing power. I ultimately felt this was the best balance of weight and battery life for the price.  I definitely wasn’t wrong about the battery life. I’m amazed. This thing lasts and lasts.  It’s not the fastest computer but it suffices for my use case.<br/><br/>Two things that bother me.<br/><br/>This first is the lack of an illuminated keyboard.  I knew it lacked one going into it, so I can’t complain that much. I just didn’t realize how much I’ve come to rely on it on my other laptops. I’m often using the computer in dark environments, where it’s difficult to see the keys.  Again, I knew this wasn’t an included feature, so this isn’t really a complaint as much as something to give extra consideration to before purchasing. With that being said, even with the lack of the illuminated keyboard, I don’t regret the purchase, and would buy again.<br/><br/>Which takes me to the second point. There is an issue with some of the video playback. In extra bright scenes in videos on YouTube and elsewhere, there is some discoloration in the highlights. Meaning, that in certain areas of the video, particularly that are white, there is some blue artifacts/pixelation happening. I have confirmed that this is an issue with this model and have seen it replicated in floor models at Best Buy and heard other people complain about this. I’m frustrated that HP has allowed this to continue to be a problem without offering a fix. As I said, most of my use cases involve writing; so video watching isn’t high up on my list of priorities. If it was, this would be a much bigger problem for me.<br/><br/>Overall, I’m pleased with the purchase given the price, and recommend it for anybody who is looking for an inexpensive, long battery life Chromebook option.</span>

<span>I got a Chromebook to replace my Macbook because I wanted a decent laptop without having to spend hundreds of dollars.  So far, this fits the bill pretty well, with a few minor differences from the Macbook.  It was really easy to set up and import my passwords, bookmarks, etc. which was really convenient.  Charges quickly and pretty much does what I need it to.  I miss not having AirPlay to mirror stuff to my Roku tv and have sound included.  I also miss having iTunes (now Apple Music), but I switched to Spotify.  There are a few little things that are different that I've had to get used to, but nothing too major. I prefer laptops to tablets or having to do everything on my phone, because I like having an actual keyboard and a decent sized screen, not a touchscreen (tablet) or a little tiny screen (phone)  All in all, it's a great little laptop for the price.</span>

<span>I don't understand all the negative reviews about the screen. It's not the BEST laptop screen I've ever used, but FAR from the worst. And for less than $250? Are you guys kidding me? Are you expecting an ipad pro level screen?<br/><br/>The laptop is solid even though it's plastic, I'm not worried about putting this thing in my backpack. While the keyboard is a little stiff for my taste, it works well. I'm just used to my mechanical keyboard on my desktop. I can write and do some coding perfectly fine and that's how I would describe this chromebook:<br/><br/>Perfectly fine.<br/>Solid.<br/>Reliable.<br/>Lenovo-quality.<br/>I might as well be in one of their commercials, but Lenovo has never failed me.<br/><br/>The negatives?<br/><br/>The screen can be a BIT wobbly when I adjust it, but that's minor. It doesn't wobble when I type, which would make me want to return it. A couple more ports would be nice as well as an SD card slot that allows the SD card to completely insert. This one, the card sticks out halfway.<br/><br/>Battery life is great, can go for hours at the library without needing to be plugged in and I'm using a higher brightness. I'm not doing anything intensive, just chrome tabs, spotify, watching Youtube.<br/><br/>If you need a laptop to take care of your internet needs and basic computer needs, this is a solid one for the price. If you need stronger hardware, then spend at least 400-500. However, if you're already spending that much money, it might be better to get a Windows machine, unless you LOVE Chromebooks.<br/><br/>I love Chrome OS for what it is. Fast, lightweight, and cost-effective. That's the name of the game. If you buy this laptop, or any laptop a this price, then don't expect a thousand-dollar plus experience and then leave horrible reviews. This is a solid chromebook, especially for the price. I'll be keeping this one for a long while and give it to a family member when it's time for me to upgrade.</span>

<span>This is my first Chromebook and I love it. The simplicity of this thing is amazing, I have an expensive Windows 10 PC that drives me crazy, I find Windows has become a very intrusive and confusing computer, that bothers you with a load of notifications and pop ups. Trying to figure out how to disable all that stuff is a real pain, Windows seems to bury all those settings, making them hard to find.  This Chromebook is none of that, the ease of this is like using a smartphone. I have absolutely no problem with the screen resolution , it looks fine to me. I can't comment on the battery life because I've yet to unplug it, I use it strictly as a stay in one place computer (plugged in all the time). Google Docs and files take a little getting used to if you never used them, but once you get used to it you'll have no problem. It was not a problem for me because I was already use them on my iPhone . You can't download outside programs because its a closed system, to me , that's a good thing because I only use it to surf the web, shop, emails and files. And because you can't download programs your not gonna pick up any viruses. If you need to edit any photos you can always download a photo app from the Play store. I've found the storage and speed for this to be just fine, it doesn't seem to slow down with numerous tabs open. You have a load of apps to download from the Google play store that should keep you happy. I don't use it to stream movies or play games so I can't comment on that, I'll streams stuff from YouTube with no problems at all. If you want a laptop to do just the basics like I do, then you can't go wrong with this for the price. To me it's way better then one of those low cost Windows PC's. I had a low end Windows PC that I bought  as a extra computer for me to use when my wife is working on the expensive PC, I hated it so much I gave it away before it was a month old. Besides being intrusive and confusing, it was slow as crap. This Chromebook is like having a giant smartphone with a keyboard, (IT'S THAT EASY). The only reason I took away one star is because I think it could of used one more USB port, other then that I love it, and if you use a computer like I do, you will too.<br/>PS. Keep in mind that this model S330 comes in different specs. My review is based on the model with the higher resolution screen  (1920 x 1080) and more memory (64gb). They have a cheaper model called the S330 with less resolution and less memory.</span>

<span>I bought this 2020 MacBook Air (8 GB RAM, 256 GB SSD storage) to replace a 2014 MacBook Air (4GB RAM, 256 GB SSD storage).  I am undeniably a fan of Apple products in general, because they work with little fuss and are built to last (note that my old MacBook Air is more than 7 years old and still working perfectly).  Although I've been underwhelmed by some Mac models in recent years, this one is stellar IMHO.  Unless you have very heavy system requirements this machine would be an excellent choice.<br/><br/>The M1 processor is very impressive, delivering outstanding performance and power/thermal efficiency simultaneously.  Battery life is every bit as good as advertised; I can charge overnight and use it all day without plugging in.  Connecting USB devices such as external drives will shorten battery life, but that's to be expected.  I love the fanless design, which means the machine is absolutely silent at all times, while the thermal efficiency of the M1 chip allows it to remain amazingly cool.  In use, this computer feels very fast, especially with apps optimized for Apple processors (as MacOS Big Sur is).  Interestingly, Microsoft has been on board early with M1 optimization; the latest Office 365 version is smooth and fast on this machine.  I also tried out MS Edge on my new laptop based on a recommendation from another user and have been so pleased with its speed and efficiency that it's my current default browser.  The touch ID and Apple Pay capability is a welcome addition.<br/><br/>The only cons I see are minor in my opinion.  Because RAM is integrated into the M1 processor, post-purchase memory expansion is not possible; if you think you'll need 16 GB of memory that model can be had from the Apple Store.  There has been criticism of the fact that this machine has only two ports, which is fair.  For me that's not insurmountable; I simply use a USB-C hub to provide additional connectivity.  I've read recently that some users have had certain hubs cause problems with their M1 Macs, which appears to be related to battery charging through these hubs.  To be on the safe side I use a built-in port for charging and have had no issues.<br/><br/>Reading through the relative handful of critical reviews, it looks to me like most (excluding actual defects, which happen with all products) are based on lack of understanding.  For example, I saw a large number of reviews complaining that this machine "has NO USB PORTS!!!", which is patently false.  In fact, its two ports are both USB, they just require a different connector.  What these users are looking for is the old USB-A connectors, which this MacBook does not have; however, that's easily fixed by using a USB-A to USB-C converter cable, or with a USB-C hub.  USB-A peripherals are gradually disappearing as well, in favor of the new connector.<br/><br/>All things considered, I really love this machine.  The $899 price (at the time I bought mine) was $100 less than I would have paid at the Apple Store, and I believe I can probably get $200 on eBay for my old MacBook Air (try that with a 7-year-old PC!) leaving me with a total outlay of $699.  Considering that I'll almost certainly get 5 or more years use out of this model, I'm very happy with my purchase and would do it again.</span>

<span>As many others have shared, the Apple MacBook Air M1 is a great laptop. The display is gorgeous. The keyboard is accurate and smooth. Apple has the best trackpads! Battery life is so good that there is no anxiety over having enough power to finish the day.<br/><br/>The setup experience is so good with Apple products. All I had to do was choose my language and connect to wi-fi and then moments later the laptop was ready for me to login.<br/><br/>The laptop integrates so well with the other Apple devices. Although I wonder why it wanted my iPhone's lock screen passcode. I am not sure how secure I feel that my iPhone's lock screen password is shared over the air with the laptop... Otherwise the MacBook Air is a great device for consuming content and for light-creative work.</span>

<span>Got this as a gift during prime day sale. It came very promptly. I also live in an apartment complex and have a special kiosk system for packages. It's nice when I am out of town which I was when the package came. It came earlier than expected. I don't usually use the kiosk but they left it in there for me all securely. Laptop works great. The gift was a success as well! The only thing is that the camera could be better. My boyfriend needed a laptop due to his Lenovo shutting down and a nice camera (his old one stopped working) to confirm his identity for online tests. He tested it out and it was pretty blurry for a pricey laptop which is why I give this 4 stars instead of 5.</span>
