<span>The app is not that great for one. Its hard to link your phone to the printer. It is also a little difficult to add your image through the app. Lastly do not expect to do any big printing at all. As in pic that is what you are going to get. Also, the little printer only has the 3 color print only. So do not expect to much black in yoir print(meaning if what you want to print is gold forget it. It will be yellow. So anything that has the Black hue. You will get the primary colors.</span>

<span>I lime this printer the way it looks but the printing is ok sometimes the color looms to opaque lines in pictures are better defined tho. If you can deal with the way it prints color you gotta also deal with th prices, I ran put of the magenta only  and that 281 cartridge was 29.99 so 32.57 with taxes now think there's another 4 cartridge in that printer, especially if you do crafting and or use 12 x 12 paper. Coneectivy is only ok as sometimes you have to connect the printer again after it goes to sleep (shut off) it won't be online no more in your system.</span>

<span>I’ve always been an hp printer gal. I made this purchase because my hp’s (all of them) have issues picking up and running heavier stock paper. I did a lot of research and found this one and so far, it has worked wonders. Lots of versatility.</span>

<span>I have searched for years to find the best printer for thick card stock and I think I finally found it. So far I am extremely impressed as I have been able to print on 5x7 130 lb card stock without any issues. It prints very clean, no streaks and exactly "centered" on the page (previous printers would print too high or low or too far to the right or left which caused lots of wasted paper, ink and having to "shave" part of the page to make the image centered). I found the installation to be very easy- within 20 minutes or so of unboxing the printer I already had my first print out. It doesn't seem to be using up ink any faster than my HP inkjet. I purchased remanufactured ink cartridges that we recommended by another reviewer but I have yet to try them. I will update this review after I've used the printer for a few projects and have a better idea of how quickly it runs through ink, if the manufactured cartridges work and if its still printing nicely on various sized card stock.<br/><br/>***update after a few months of use- the printer accepted the re-manufactured cartridges without any issues which is amazing. I have run into a little trouble with the rear feed. If I’m printing on thick card stock I have to manually feed every sheet which is extremely time consuming. It will print beautifully but when I have 100+ pages to print it takes so much more time than it would if I could put in a stack and walk away then come back to replace it. I still love the printer but I have to make the time to call canon and see if this is a common problem and see what I can do to fix it.</span>

<span>Bought this printer as watching a friend print endless photos, with wifi connection.  Printed fabulous pictures and banners for the first print on wifi!  If hard wired it continues to print with no problem.  There is a small problem with just this machine staying connected to any of my PC's by wifi.  So I have decided to return this one but stick with canon and up size.  I love that it uses ink sparingly but still looks professional!</span>

<span>This would likely be great IF you only use it at home on a good wifi network and with just one computer. I bought this for travel while traveling in our motorhome.  Certainly not portable but the best I could find for a reasonable cost. It set up with only minor difficulty at home and once on the home wifi network it worked just fine from multiple laptops. .  It prints beautifully. You have to load its HP Smart app to use the features.  I think I would not use the auto-ink supply option as it complicates things a lot.<br/>  On the road.. I rate it a one star for the difficulty I encountered getting it "re-setup" to change to the RV Park's network, and getting it set up to "print direct" was just as bad.  One can't be both on a remote wifi network and print direct... one or the other it seems. Not too handy for printing things you are researching online.  Instructions are not clear and the Smart App is no help either.  I finally resorted to using an old USB printer cord which I got to work, once I learned the wifi had to be shut off on the input panel.  One would think you could just shift the USB cord and have it work on another laptop (wife's).  No.... that took even longer. And.... if you cannot connect it to a wifi network, the HP Smart app will not let it print as it wants to track your ink supply if you have signed up for the free ink trial period. The cartridges that come with the printer will get you started but may not last as long as some you purchase.<br/>  I have had computers since before they had hard drives.  The early desk jets were great. This one is beyond my willingness to fool with.  Of course, it could all be due to operator error, but this operator no longer has the patience to tolerate things that are not somewhat intuitive or at least well explained in documentation one doesn't have to search out online,  including obscure PIN settings and info provided only when the printer itself prints it out.  Still looking for a simple one for travel. This is not it.</span>

<span>So I like this printer for my uses for sure. It's simple and prints at a reasonable speed. The only gripe I have is that I have to trouble shoot why it doesn't stay connected to my laptop (Chromebook) while both are on and have internet access without interruption. I have printed something then tried to print something else immediately after that was done and it wouldn't connect until I went to reset the printer. It could just be my lack of tech abilities that is causing a random issue that's easy to resolve, I am unsure though. Otherwise, it's compact, prints at a reasonably fast pace, prints good quality stuff, and is fairly simple. I recommend this if you just need a printer to use once in a while for average quality printing. If you are printing 100+ pages a day, this is definitely not your printer or if you need to print very high quality stuff.</span>

<span>Not worth it.<br/><br/>(Not one for reviews but...) Quick overview:<br/><br/>• Hypothesis: HP Printer is only able to be “installed” on (1) device, Customers are unable to adjust wi-fi passwords/or providers, and potential un-successful client services offerings and spam risk.<br/>o HP “Customer Support” OR “Home Support” is located within various regions. Unless you are looking to spend your time on hold with the representatives who are disguised as Sales Spam Artists (potentially hacking into your computer software system), or navigating your way through the “self-service” systems, Individuals and owners alike waste over 2+ hours on “hold” only to lead to further unresolved issues and even worse data breaches of contracts and information systems.<br/>o The Websites/Apps, Directions, and Instructions provided within the company lead to dissatisfied customer experiences.<br/>o Unless you’re trying to look for a “quick fix”, it might work in the beginning but long term – the value of the worth, from my perspective, I haven’t been able to witness.<br/><br/>***If curious, notes below:<br/><br/>Previously having formerly invested in other brand name printers, I was unaware of my expectations… especially from a well-respected brand of HP.<br/><br/>After purchasing the “HP DeskJet 2755 All-in-One Printer” or  “HP DeskJet 2755e Wireless Color All-in-One Printer with Bonus 6 Months Instant Ink with HP+” on 04/22 from Amazon; was incredibly excited and pleasantly surprised with the seamless installation.<br/><br/>Once registering the device, customers are informed of the partnership with HP Instant Ink, which works closely together with HP Development Company, L.P. to schedule automated “ink” delivery. Packages are presented with various price ranges to the customer - boiling down to a per ink cartridge and anticipated number allotment of the number of pages being published by the owner, every month.<br/><br/>For the first 1-2 months, hadn’t experienced anything alarming. However, had unexpected technical challenges which shortly developed upon updating the Wi-Fi password.<br/><br/>– Out of security purposes, it is recommended in general to update passwords and login information ~ about every 90ish days. -<br/><br/>When attempting to re-connecting to the Wi-Fi, customers immediately might experience unanswered questions; “bot-chats” that provide additional links to articles within the website that do not directly answer the question originally situation; and when finally getting in touch with “HP Support” (via phone call) are then confronted with irrelevant questions - unrelated to the product malfunctions - and then are continued to be ridiculed with various recommendations of “security systems” packages. Whether this is purchased or not, they have “control” or “access” to the computer. Unfortunately, the computer was unable to be revived due to the unexpended circumstance which led to a Product Technician (of a well-named company) reviewing the computer, and communicating “I have never seen anything like this before.”<br/><br/>With the original computer being hacked and shut down, a re-installation within a brand-new year-to-date computer, the attempt was made with HP Development Company, L.P (multiple.) No surprise, but once again was unable to connect to the Wi-Fi. (Within consideration for the company and due diligence of the Wi-Fi Provider, multiple other devices were able to reconnect within a blink, and multiple attempts to re-install the HP Development Company, L.P. “HP DeskJet 2755 All-in-One Printer” or  “HP DeskJet 2755e Wireless Color All-in-One Printer with Bonus 6 Months Instant Ink with HP+”.)<br/><br/>Buying items from Amazon is much more convenient, however, there is something really to be said of this product not being able to be returned, especially with the false advertisement and guarantees.<br/><br/>From a company perspective, can’t help but be concerned about the ethics and values within the HP business. Highly would recommend considering alternative replacements for the Product, Engineering, and Human Resources departments to be able to hold the brand standards and values we have all longed for when purchasing a product, especially one so accredited as such.<br/><br/>Additionally, if the machine is unable to correspond with basic security policies and password updates - the potential buyer and customer need to be made aware of this within the original description before moving forward with payment and further “challenges”.<br/><br/>Best of luck.</span>

<span>For the price, and for a home printer that’s occasionally used, it meets our needs. I got this printer a few weeks ago and it did take some time (an hour or so) to connect it to my laptop and cell phone (for the remote printing capabilities). I am not tech savvy, and I did get frustrated during the process. It also lures you in with “ink for 6 months!”…more like 1 month. I print the occasional paper for my kids school, a recipe here and there, and maybe a few sheets - it’s out of ink and I’d guess I’ve used 30 sheets. Definitely not 6 months worth, and definitely not if you’re using it as a primary printer. I’m disappointed because I think that was false advertising. For what I need it for, what it does and the cost, it’s fine for our home desk option. Don’t purchase if you’re using it for college kids who will need to print a lot, or for business/office use; you’ll run out of ink constantly. Let’s also mention the ink is $30…after 1 refill, I’m going to donate the printer and buy something else, or else I’ve spent more on ink refills than the device cost!</span>

<span>I spent 3 hours on the phone with Epson customer &amp; tech support. I bought this printer mainly for the auto two-sided printing...I really wanted auto two-sided printing (plus the larger sizes). Monday, I spent 4 hours trying to get it to print on both sides on its own to no avail.<br/><br/>So I called tech support. For an hour the support guy tried to help, and failed. He said it was hardware malfunction. To get a replacement though I would have to let them put a ~$250 hold on my card. I said that was unacceptable [I get that their POV about sending a $400 printer to someone who already has a $400 printer, but I'm not giving you *more* money when what you gave me doesn't work and not everyone has $250 they can just "hold"... thats like a tank of gas for some of y'all right now] So I asked to speak to a manager.<br/><br/>The manager said the printer only auto prints for letter and legal. The website and all advertising online just says auto two-sided printing. The only caveat is anything bigger than 8.5x14 has to go in the back tray and that tray requires manual flipping. I was trying to print 7x10, which fits in the front tray. I explain that the company needs to be clear about what the printer does and doesn't do, that their website is MISLEADING--it's borderline fraud. Dude tells me it's in the manual ('cause I totally had a manual before I bought the printer???) and says I should have known; it's not their fault....<br/><br/>After I went off, he transferred me to customer service so I could make a formal complaint and they admitted the wording should be more clear.  They started a case/process for my complaint.<br/><br/>But I'm an engineer and I was not satisfied with the notion that it didn't work. Mechanically it didn't make sense. So I played around with it some more last night and as long as you choose a preset size that is close to your actual paper size (I chose JIS B5 since its closest to 7x10) the printer *DOES* auto 2-sided print for non-letter sized documents. The techs and managers just don't know how to use the products...which is understandable because it took someone with a PhD in Embedded Systems 2 days to figure it out...</span>

<span>Excuse the long review.  When my old Epson died in the middle of a print job, I was so excited to be able to purchase this model printer.  It was the last one available.  The dealer got it to me quickly; no problems with shipping.  However, the printer itself proved to be a big problem.  According to the reviews, people love or hate this printer.  I myself was totally exasperated before asking for a refund.  Why?  First, the power button is hard to see.  When going through the installation process, my first hiccup was that I  could not see the power button.  I kept hitting the home button instead.  Realizing that the home button did not have the proper icon, I got out a flashlight and hunted around until I found the power button.  {Yes, I wear glasses but they correct to 20/20].  A small irritation, really, and easily corrected once I found the right button. The rest of the loading process went smoothly.  Ink cartridges were easy to install.  Synching with computer was a breeze.  Test pages on plain paper and fine-tuning print nozzles took time but were easy.  The test page on plain paper looked sharp.  However, printing on photo quality paper was a disaster.  First, pages hung up in the printer. I kept getting an error message saying to reload paper when the paper was properly in the tray.  Had to keep opening and closing the tray. Double checked to see that the type of paper was properly entered.  Check.  Paper installed correctly.  Check.  Print quality on computer and printer synced.  Checked.  Right side paper up.  The problem?  When printing on photo paper--high gloss, matt presentation quality, and semi-gloss, I kept getting smeared looks--the results reminded me of watercolors.  Tried printing on top of the line Ilford paper--worse.  After more than four hours of checking, retesting, recleaning, redoing, gave up.  [Incidentally, I have used Epson printers for years.  Never had this sort of problem.]  Finally gave up and called Amazon.<br/><br/>Amazon to the rescue!  They did have to connect me with Epson to see if Epson could help me solve the problem.  That call was a disaster. Summary:  Did you try this?  yes, 2x.  Did you try this?  yes, 2x.  You must be loading paper wrong.  No, I have tripled checked....After over an hour of repeating the basic steps over and over,  my hero Amazon person stepped in, ending the call, and allowed me to return the machine.  Repacked and had machine picked up.  Hurrah.<br/><br/>Looking back, since I had problems with the paper not loading as it should, perhaps it is some sort of roller problem.  Don't know.<br/><br/>Several folks have spoken highly of this printer.  I did much research before ordering it and it was generally highly praised.  The test shots on plain paper which I printed as part of the loading process have fine detail and great color gamuts.  I think I just got a lemon.  However, with Amazon, the pain of the lemon is now gone.<br/><br/>So...I have to give this individual printer a one because while it prints great on plain paper, it is useless for printing quality pictures on photo grade paper.  I give tech support [EPSON] a two because the person I spoke of did not seem to know much except how to start the printer going.  I give AMAZON support a 5!!!They were my hero in this situation and did not jack up the price because of scarcity.  I also give the seller a 5 for they got the printer to me quickly in great shape.  I give the printer a one for "touch screen" because it didn't have one.  It had buttons to push instead.  Not a big problem but would take longer to set settings than a touch screen would.<br/><br/>If these printers were widely available, I probably would reorder and try another, but as of 9/1/20, decent printers and photo printers are not available as a result of the Covid-19 outbreak.</span>

<span>The two on the left were printed with the Epson while the one on the right was printed by staples “photo quality”. I love the ability to set up the print file myself and that it prints at full-bleed flawlessly on a basic 8.5x11 photo paper!<br/>I printed 2 to test the satin vs presentation matte paper and the colors have little difference! You can see the Staples print does not match the color and appears darker than on screen. I didn’t do any color correcting prior to printing and it only took 2 minutes to print a photo. It’s pretty spectacular for the price!<br/>I’ll update in about 6 months to see where we’re at with quality.</span>

<span>When my HP 8610 died, I decided not to pay the $87 for a new print head. Afterall, for $12 more I could buy a new printer, right? Well, I bought the inexpensive HP 4100, and boy, do I miss my old printer. This new one just feels cheap. The plastic seems to be thinner. It doesn't have a paper tray but a slot, which on one hand you can see how much paper you have left, but then the paper gets dusty and has to be lined up in the slot. There's no memory card slot which was great for cameras and tablets but the instructions say it has a USB port for transferring info, not for installation. I came to the realization that I didn't need a fax machine; I don't have a land line, and who does. Scanning is just another word for printing unless you're making pdfs. So, I really didn't need a more advanced printer. This one will print my recipes and letters just fine. I have only printed one page and it was perfect. This little machine will suit me just fine. My only disappointment is that is doesn't have a sleep cycle. I left my old printer always turned on and it would cycle itself into a sleep mode. This one doesn't.  I'm anxious to see how long the ink lasts. I enrolled in the HP Smart Ink plan, six months free, and 99 cents a month for 10 pages. Would I buy this printer again? If I had the money, I'd have probably upgraded, but for the kind of printing I do, I just couldn't justify spending the extra bucks. And yes, I love HP printers because of the tech support and service. I've never owned a bad HP product.</span>

<span>Print color boldness is less bright on this printer than my previous Epson printers that I have had for at least 25 years.  Also my call to Epson Tech ended up being a SPAM that I had to work on all-day and would have cost me $21,000.00.</span>

<span>Shame on me for not doing detailed research before purchase.  The 3820 ADF doesn't allow automatic 2 sided to 2 sided copy, something I do frequently.  Worse, it seems that the Epson 3820 won't even allow the ADF to be used for manual 1-2 or 2-2 sided copying. Rather, I discovered, for 1-2 or 2-2 sided input copying, documents must be placed on the scanner glass, one side at a time, following display prompt.  It's an awkward but effective work around, and surprising since the Epson 3620 I replaced did 2 sided auto ADF, and, as I recall 1 - 2 sided manual using the ADF with a prompting scheme.  That said, the printer does a credible job printing text, is fairly quiet, set up was straight forward and worked as expected. One other thing that should be pointed out, I don't think the 3820 is intended for printing photographs.</span>

<span>I haven't had any issues with wifi disconnecting but I had a previous epson printer and I had changed some settings on my router that I think is why I don't have any problems. I didn't install any software, I just plugged it in, connected to internet and started using it. I have printed from my phone several times. I don't plan on installing software or doing any uppdates. I buy name brand ink anyways but I think sometimes even from Amazon, you get a fake. I think this is why my last printer turned into a brick, probably bad ink.

<span>This was a 5 minute set up- simple and easy.  I don't do a lot of printing at home, so I didn't want to spend a ton of money on a printer.  This was a reasonable price.  It is not super fast, but I don't need it to be.  My only complaint is there is a blue light that stays on- it this the length of the paper tray.  The only way to shut it off is to shut the whole printer off.  According to HP you should not keep it off for some reason.</span>

<span>The printer's setup for me seemed pretty easy. I'm not sure if WiFi and other phones may cause issues, but with my phone and WiFi, set up worked fine wirelessly. The only thing I didn't like while setting up was the alignment procedure with the scanner. I don't personally plan to use the scanner and set up allowed me to skip the process, however I wasn't allowed to print anything unless I performed this step. I would prefer if they leave that feature off and if I decide to do scanning, then have that set up procedure forced. After the ridiculous and long setup, printing has been a breeze.<br/><br/>HP Smart crashes a lot and does not work on Chromebooks btw which for students is a real let down. You can still use the printer but you can't check ink levels or use any of the features within HP Smart app.<br/><br/>The HP Instant Ink service can save you a lot of money if you are constantly printing. I don't print that often but still tried to use the offer. However, HP sends you the XL ink for the printer which sounds nice at first but then you realize that the XL cartridges jam the printer. So the program doesn't benefit you that well or helpful in this case. My advice is stick to buying the normal sized $30 black and color cartridges which is very inexpensive when compared to other HP ink and if you're like me, you'll need to buy new ink about every two/three months or so.<br/><br/>Overall, if you can get passed the long setup and manage the stupid app, printing on here is pretty great. I would recommend this printer for people who solely plan on printing/scanning only. For the hard setup and annoying app, that lowered this review to three stars since they are the biggest thing you'll encounter and should be simple especially when you have to force your customers to use them.</span>

<span>I just had to say that I almost did not purchase this printer based on the many reviews stating how difficult the set-up was. My beloved Cannon printer had expired and family members recommended HP with their ink subscription. I wanted the HP Envy 6000e printer but it seemed like the set-up was going to be a nightmare based on comments from other purchasers. However, believing the best, I used HP Smart App on my desktop computer, followed its very clear directions, and was printing in no time at all! I was so surprised at the simplicity of set-up when using the HP Smart app. I do not know what problems other customers ran into- but really, I'm 75 years young and it could not have been easier. I tested printing duplexed articles, images, and photos. All crisp and beautiful! Now I have a ZIPPY and lovely HP Envy 6000e printer! Please don't hesitate to buy this printer because HP offers a lot of support should it be needed. I am quite pleased.</span>

<span>I’ve had many inkjet printers. Wanted something better and faster but didn’t want to pay $800 for laser printer just to print the kids school papers.<br/><br/>I’ve had this printer for 7 months and I have print over 7600 pages according to the printer settings. I use generic toner off Amazon with no issues. 2 pack is less than $30. I wouldn’t hesitate to buy if your not printing 1000 pages daily.</span>

<span>This is a very nice printer for the money. I would advise looking at the videos provided before setting up. They answered a lot of questions. I let my machine idle in deep sleep as I don't do a lot of printing. It will take a little longer for the first print.</span>

<span>This is a simple stand-alone printer with no scanner.  It starts promptly after receiving a print command, with no hemming and hawing and "ink management" like our old printer.  It just prints.  Clear text, fair graphics.  Exactly what we wanted in a home printer, at a reasonable price (rare these days).</span>

<span>So this was really easy to set up from the Quickstart guide. Just download the software, your quickstart guide gives the website address. Don't use the included disk because it will be out of date. Plug in the printer, plug in a USB printer cable, no it doesn't come with one but I have spares from old dead printers. Plug cable into computer, turn on printer. Windows will automatically install drivers, this isn't a problem. Run the software installer. It will walk you through the installation. Put in your network key when it asks you, not your router password. It connects right away to your network. Unplug USB from computer. After installation you can use the included IPrint &amp; Scan software tool icon to tweak your printer settings from browser based ip address that opens automatically when you click on the tool icon. You can log into your settings using the admin password that's on back of the printer and this will give you a more complete set of settings. You can print out the initial settings from there as a baseline in case you change something and don't like it. The menues are pretty self explanitory though lack detailed info. You can download all the many printer guides from the Brother site for your printer. The complete online guide is good for opening in your web browser and being able to click on the table of contents to quickly get to what you want. If you save it as a PDF you won't be able to click the TOC links. It's too fat to print out unless you like wasting toner and paper. This guide gives all the printer menu options on the LED and how to access them from the printer. You can set the toner Continue mode from computer, the deep sleep mode has to be set from there printer. I haven't had any problems with it coming out of deep sleep. The printer automatically enters sleep mode but comes out fast, warms up fast from power on and prints very fast. The double sided setting works very well. You can set your print preferences from your print options menu from whatever program you are using, toner save, paper type, toner density etc and save them in custom settings tab. I'm using a 20 lb paper, so it does curl from the heat. I'll try a thicker 32 lb paper for when I need better copies. I ran 80 lb smooth cardstock through and it handled it well but did get some heat curling. The printer doesn't feel hot. Paper just doesn't like heat. It's not that big or heavy and fits well in my small office. The cord is a decent enough length, 3 pronged. Paper tray is adjustable to different sizes. Print is good and clear, toner can be adjusted from very dark to toner save, in your printing preferences. Sign into brother-usa.com to register your machine. I'm using this to print plain documents and high quality black and white graphics. Grey tones are good too if that's what you are needing. Brother Creative Center has lots of free projects you can use for printing or to use their graphics. I like Brother products, have had good experience with them. Haven't decided if I'm going to use after market toner or stick to Brother. Depends on how fast I end up going through toner. I'm giving a 5 star rating for tech support though I haven't called them for this printer, that rating is based on tech support I've received with my other brother all in one ink jet and my brother scan n cut. The printer came new, well packaged and fairly fast. It's not pretty if you're looking for pretty. Please note I've had this printer only one day and if things change I'll update to reflect that. I paid full price for this printer, 115.00, so this review is totally my own.</span>
