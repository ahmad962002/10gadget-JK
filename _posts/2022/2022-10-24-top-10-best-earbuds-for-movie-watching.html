<span>So I need wireless earbuds and bought these. They were great. Sounded awesome, easy interface / functions, and fit snugly in my ear without falling out. Then, being somewhat of an audiophile, I decided I wanted to high-end and upgrade my listening experience. So I purchased a pair of $200 earbuds, the SENNHEISER Momentum True Wireless 2.  I used the Sennheiser for about two weeks and they did sound good.<br/><br/>BUT...after misplacing the Sennheiser's one day I went back and put these $60 JLabs back in and they were WAY BETTER! First the interface was much more intuitive and easy to use on the JLabs. Second, they fit and stayed in the ears much better. Lastly, the "JLab signature" sound setting had a better equalization sound.<br/><br/>So long story short, spare yourself the big money and get these JLab wireless earbuds. They are the best sounding earbuds at a very low price. They sounded better than the $200 Sennheiser's I bought.</span>

<span>Annoyingly I keep rebuying these. I don't want to keep having to, but I travel a lot and I lose things sometimes. My point being is; I always rebuy these. They are a great bang for buck. I think I'm on my 4th pair.<br/><br/>Battery life is around 4 hours before needing to be put in the case, and they charge very quickly in there.<br/><br/>Noise cancelling is pretty good. It's enough to keep most noises hidden on an airplane. Baby screaming can get through if it's close enough.<br/><br/>I've only had one problem with them where the left and right one would not reconnect to each other. Their troubleshooting guide DID NOT WORK. I tried it many times. I eventually fixed it by finding  a comment on their troubleshoot video on YouTube which described a procedure completely different than their guide. This worked but I almost got rid of them.<br/><br/>These go on sale often and for the price, I don't think they can be beat.</span>

<span>These JLAB ANC earbud are fantastic so far. I've had them for about 6 months now and as my first pair of wireless earbuds and my first set of Active Noise Cancellation of any sort they are fantastic. I've wanted an active noise cancellation headset or earbuds for quite a while and finally jumped into the pool. There are dozens of options that provide a wide range of price points and consumer ratings. I read a lot of reviews and settled on these from JLAB and I am glad I did.<br/>I get very reasonable noise cancellation. They won't completely block out a lawn mower or a crying baby on an airplane but will make those sounds tolerable. When I cut the grass, I wear the earbuds and a cheap pair of over the ear sound protectors and get great results.  I have tested the $200+ noise cancelling headsets but only in the store and I think these perform very nearly as well for an affordable price.<br/>As they are my first earbuds of any kind, I can only say that they stay put. The memory foam tips come in 3 sizes and are comfortable. I can't say if they are heavy or light. I can tell that I am wearing them for sure but they do not grow bothersome or painful after several hours of continuous use. I've gone 4 or 5 hours with them in and found no discomfort.<br/>That leads to battery life. Advertised as 10 hour capacity, I can't see ever wearing them that long at a stretch. My longest session was about 7 hours. I think I have heard the "low battery" alert just one time. Between uses, I pop the earbuds back into the carrying case (included with the earbuds) and that tops up the earbud charge. So, it is difficult to say just how long a single charge will last. I carry the case in my jeans pocket or a day pack to use the earbuds several times a day totaling maybe 3 or 4 hours per day. The LED lights on the case let you know charge lever remaining and I pop them into a USB port on a laptop or wall when I see the LED dots drop a light or two. That isn't test to failure kind of report but is what I get with my normal use.<br/>My only regret is that I didn't look to see if they are offered in colors other than black. I have left them laying on a counter or bedside table and the dark color can make them difficult to find. But then they aren't white or some other stand-out color when I am wearing them. I guess it is a fair tradeoff and I will take the look when I am wearing them.<br/>I don't recall just what I paid for the earbuds here on Amazon.com but I think it was in the $50 neighborhood. I am very pleased with the performance, durability and functionality for that price point. I could afford the higher price for the big-name earbuds but can't see why I need to. They certainly offer style points if that is your goal. I prefer very good sound quality, battery life, water resistance and the rest while keeping an extra $100 in my pocket. That fits nicely alongside the JLAB charging case that comes with the earbuds.</span>

<span>Here’s a pros and cons list;<br/><br/>PROS<br/>* Answering calls and texts hands free is nice. As someone who works full time and always has full hands, this is really nice.<br/>* They’re small and there are no wires, so I don’t have to untangle or worry about wires getting messed up when I put these in my bag. I can also put them in my pocket.<br/>* The charging case is convenient. I like only having to charge the case every three or four days, and always having it on me in case my earbuds get low.<br/><br/>CONS<br/>* They don’t fit in my ears. They constantly fall out, so I’m always readjusting. If I walk at a fast pace, it seems to speed up the process.<br/>* They’re not noise cancelling.<br/>* The sound quality is a bit weak. I have 8 dollar headphones that are better with sound quality.<br/>* They cut out sometimes for no reason and I can’t figure out why.<br/>* They aren’t very loud.<br/><br/>I think that for $100, these could be much better.</span>

<span>They sound great, are easy to charge and store, the batteries last a very long time, and the noise canceling feature works very well. They are really easy to connect to any device too. But they have a tendency to fall out of my ear, and that costs them a star. Maybe it is just my particular ears, but almost every time I use them, one manages to fall out and hit the ground at some point. Because of that, I have to be careful where I use them. Motorcycle rides and river activities are out of the question. Once one fell out while I was on the riding mower, and it took me about ten very stressful minutes to find it. I have since learned that it helps to wrap a bandanna around my head and ears when mowing. Unfortunately this isn't a perfect solution either, as the other day one still managed to fall out and hit the ground when mowing. Fortunately I found it right away that time.<br/><br/>Thank goodness they certainly do seem to be very durable. My kid's Airpod Pros got washed and dried, and they still worked! I heard them clanking around in the drier for 30 minutes, but thought it was just a nickel or something.<br/><br/>Anyway, for around the house or office they are great. But don't think you can trust them to go anywhere.</span>

<span>I've tried a lot of pod and over the head gear for longs hours of work. For whatever reason, these sit in my ear most comfortably. I actually hate noise cancelling features because I like hearing what's going on around me. Much better than holding a handheld to my ear like the "old" days!</span>

<span>I love my AirPods. I thought about getting the AirPods Pro but I didn’t wanna spend that much more just to have the noise canceling feature. Now I will probably upgrade in a year or two now that they’ve even improved the AirPods Pro even more.<br/><br/>Coming from somebody who has an iPad and iPhone and an iMac at home having the AirPods and the ability to Switch between them so effortlessly without having to unpair and repair is so nice.<br/>I’ve had a number of Bluetooth headsets over the years from Plantronics to generic to a number of other different companies I don’t even know if I could remember every different manufacture that I’ve had. I always hated that they were bulky they never fit in my ear just right. I just never felt like they were great and it was always complicated they seem to fuss to pair up and especially if they ever unpaired then it was starting all over again. I love that the minute that I got my AirPods I flipped open the case and right away my iPhone registers that they are there and with the top of a Button on my phone and the top of the button on the AirPods in a couple of seconds I am paired up.<br/><br/>I also have a very nice charger that I bought right here on Amazon for about $25 and it will charge my Apple Pencil my AirPods my Apple Watch and my iPhone all at the same time which is amazing and so nice that I can just click my AirPods case on there and they charge up in a very short time.<br/><br/>First off I’m not a sound engineer or an audio file so I can’t say that they have the absolute best sound quality and I’m sure that they don’t I can’t imagine that if you went out and got some of the beads or some other type of wireless headset that fits over your entire ear with a bigger driver in it that of course it’s going to have better sound quality.<br/>But I love that they are tiny small and easy to just throw in the case. The battery life is great if my case is fully charged with the AirPods in and charged I can go to complete times to almost dead with both AirPods being used. If I only use one way talking on the phone I can go even more so in between case charging times is sometimes over a week which is absolutely amazing. The talk time on them is very long as well. I’ve never sat down and figured up exactly whether I get the exact time that Apple says.<br/>I love that the minute that I put them in my ear I get a nice little tone to let me know that they’ve connected if I’m listening to music and I take them out it automatically pauses. I love that it will even pause my music if I get an iMessage and it will read my message it will tell me who it’s from if they’re in my contact list if not it will read me the phone number and then read me the message and then asked me if I would like to respond all without touching my phone.<br/>I love Apple products even if they are a little more expensive in some areas but I love that for instance with the AirPods home they tie Effortlessly Into my phone my Mac and my iPad.<br/>I absolutely hate when I am talking on the phone for more than a couple of minutes to have to hold the phone. Also I run a business and so I have to multitask sometimes someone calls and I need to be able to pick up a remote to navigate to something to check I may need to grab the computer etc. and having the ability to have both hands free to do something like that while still talking and not worrying about the AirPods falling out of my ear is worth more than the money that I paid for them by far and then all the other features that come with it are great.<br/><br/>So in the end I think that they are amazing and I’ve had it again a number of different Bluetooth headsets and they never fit right they fall out of my ear or the ones that took over my ears are always so uncomfortable after a short period of time that I never ended up using them I always ended up using my wired earbuds that come with my iPhone.</span>

<span>Linkbuds S I am using are connected to my PC, android phone and iphone. They are very easy to switch between three devices. On PC I use it for Teams. These sounds very natural for calling and never notcied any disruption. I did reset these few times due to some connection issues when I paired these multiple times to same phone but they working very well. Noise cancellation and transparency mode are very good.<br/><br/>I feel they lack the support to stay connected with two devices at the same time. They are still the best.</span>

<span>I've been eyeing these buds since they were released but was hesitant to purchase them due to the mixed reviews for the ANC, even with the initial launch discount. That said, my new neighbors are frat boys who party at any hour and are destroying my night-shift body's minimal sleep schedule. And, while I do have noise canceling technology (Bose Headphones), they aren't devices that one can wear comfortably in bed. As such, I decided to bite the bullet when these buds went on sale on Prime Day for $158.<br/><br/>Having worn these now for a few hours, I'll share my current thoughts:<br/> - ANC is far from sub-par. You might notice a decrease in quality if you're used to the high-end stuff, but if you're like me and your only experience with NC are headphones that create pressure on your ears, this is certainly a worthy purchase. The Sony app is still learning to adjust (it has only been a few hours after all) so I'll sometimes hear my fan on full blast if I move locations, but the earbuds adjust and make the fan noise completely vanish within about 15 seconds.<br/> - I consider myself to have ears on the smaller scale (I'm 5'1") and am usually skeptical of earbuds that have a round body. That said, these have not yet caused any ear pain and the Medium ear tips (these are the tips that are on the earbuds when you open the box) had a fairly comfortable fit. After a few hours, I decided to try the Small ear tips and realized that they were the better fit for the fact that the earbud bodies sat more snugly in my ears and didn't protrude as much. Unfortunately, I found that the Small tips were a tad too small for my ears as the NC could no longer completely block out the sound of my fan. After about 5-10 minutes of bouncing between the Medium and Small tips, I decided to stick with the Medium tips since NC was of better quality. And it's not like I'm worried about the buds falling out of my ears.<br/> - Charging is fairly simple, both for the buds and the case. I did notice that some folks here were upset about the lack of wireless charging but, as a cat parent, I find the ability to charge my case via a secure cable extremely reassuring.</span>

<span>I like them much. They are nice and small, the case is nice too. They have a long battery (I use them to work out 5 times a week and the case needs to be charged every other week). They are comfortable (although you couldn't sleep on the side with them), the noise cancellation is very good and I like that it auto-adapts to walk/stay/run. The only con is that you cannot use them to work out. Once you sweat and they are humid, they slide out of the ear! Every time I run, I have to remove one after 15 min ish because it goes away. Same if you do some yoga or stuff when head is down and you sweat, then they don't stick in your ears....</span>

<span>The Sony Linkbuds S are a shrunk-down, improved version of the already excellent WF-1000XM4. I wasn't expecting this. Given the "Linkbuds" moniker I was expecting them to prioritize ambient sound features over all else, just like the original Linkbuds, but that simply isn't the case here.<br/><br/>Build: the Linkbuds S are impossibly small compared to the WF-1000XM4, Sony's previous noise canceling earphones. They actually resemble the Samsung Galaxy buds 2 in overall size and shape. They also sport a nice large touch sensitive area that no one should have trouble missing. The only gripe I do have is that the outer surface is textured and this can cause some discomfort if it rubs against the crus helix.<br/><br/>Case: the case is definitely one of the more pocketable out there. It's about the same size as the Airpods Pro case, but slightly shorter and narrower, albeit a bit thicker. However, it also has a textured surface which can make it a little difficult to slide in and out of pockets.<br/><br/>Fit: the Linkbuds S fit very similar to the Galaxy Buds 2 and deeper than the WF-1000XM4. They are a little fiddly to fit. In my case I have to rotate them back and forth to get them to seat correctly. Although Sony instructs users to rotate the buds backwards to get a good fit I actually found this uncomfortable because the buds would rub against my Crus Helix and cause discomfort. Rotating them forward slightly fixed the issue. Once the buds were in place I found the fit to be secure and that, combined with their light weight, meant that it was easy to forget they were there. My one complaint about the fit is that the buds are so small that it's very difficult to insert them without either accidentally hitting the touch area or rubbing a finger against the noise canceling microphone, resulting in some static noise.<br/><br/>Noise canceling: the noise canceling on the Linkbuds S is fantastic. Although the Linkbuds S are advertised as being open I actually found them to be more isolating than the WF-1000XM4s without noise canceling on. With noise canceling on I actually found the Linkbuds S to be slightly superior to the WF-1000XM4 in terms of blocking out background noise and they certainly blow the Galaxy Buds Pro/2 out of the water. I haven't had chance to test the Linkbuds S with very low frequency sounds (e.g. public transport, planes) but for blocking out office and household noise they're the best true wireless earphones I've tried.<br/><br/>Sound: I saved the best to last. I was very pleasantly surprised with the sound quality of the Linkbuds S. The WF-1000XM4s were a big disappointment in this regard, with an overly dark presentation for my taste that led to recessed mids and lackluster treble. The Linkbuds S by comparison adopt a Harman-like tuning that presents mids and treble brilliantly with a satisfying bass boost that doesn't dominate the overall sound. The Linkbuds S definitely beat the WF-1000XM4s for overall sound and they're up there with the Galaxy Buds Pro/2, which are the reigning champs. Comparing the Galaxy Buds side by side with the Linkbuds S I honestly can't pick a favorite amongst the three, which I think is a very good thing.<br/><br/>Other: in my limited tests the transparency features are great, as with the WF-1000XM4s. The only other thing that I think is worth noting is that the Linkbuds S struggle to maintain LDAC connectivity more than the WF-1000XM4s. This isn't surprising, given the small size, but is worth considering for anyone who wants to use LDAC in challenging environments or on the go.<br/><br/>Wrap up: previously if I wanted to recommend a pair of true wireless earphones for someone I would have to include a 'but'. The Airpods Pro have great noise canceling but the sound isn't top tier and they don't play well with Android devices. The Galaxy Buds sound fantastic but the noise canceling isn't great and they don't play well with iOS. The WF-1000XM4s have top tier noise canceling and work well with both iOS and Android devices, but their sound isn't the best. The Linkbuds S on the other hand have top tier noise canceling, work excellent with both iOS and Android, and have excellent sound. These are now my default recommendation to anyone looking for new True Wireless earphones.<br/><br/>Alternative picks: If it wasn't for the better Bluetooth connectivity of the WF-1000XM4s and the improved battery life the Linkbuds S would have made the XM4s redundant. Whether the increased price is worth it for those things will be up to the individual. I think there's still a case to be made for getting the cheaper Galaxy buds over the Linkbuds S if noise canceling isn't a priority. However, I think the only reason to pay more for the Airpods Pro would be if you really like the design and/or the enhanced integration with iOS is really important.</span>

<span>These earbuds are amazing!! I have many pairs of wireless earbuds, but these offer a lot of things that others don't. They give amazing sound quality in a pair of open-designed buds, making them a much better option than Airpods or Buds Live. In this review, I'll compare the Linkbuds to those buds, as well as Sony's flagship WF-1000xm4s (which I will refer to as xm4s).<br/><br/>SOUND QUALITY: 4.5<br/>-Wow. The Linkbuds have an incredibly clean sound that sets them apart from other open-designed earbuds. The mids are clean and the highs are crisp, but something to keep in mind is that the low end is not very prominent. It is more of a bass you can hear rather than feel, which is to be expected for a pair of open-designed earbuds.<br/>When compared to other open-designed earbuds like the AirPods and Buds Live, the Linkbuds blow them out of the water. The AirPods and Buds Live have more bass, but when compared to the Linkbuds, it is evident that the mids and highs get completely drowned out as a result of the added bass.<br/>-The xm4s and Linkbuds have similar mids and highs, but the low-end on the xm4s is amazing and gives the music a lot more body. That's to be expected from sealed earbuds.<br/>-Overall, these are by far the best sounding pair of open-designed earbuds I have ever used. They are the closest sounding buds to open-backed headphones I have tried, and even though they miss some bass, they give the music a really pleasant and natural sound.<br/><br/>COMFORT: 5<br/>-The Linkbuds are extremely comfortable. They are similar to AirPods and Buds Live in the sense that I can wear them for extended periods of time without my ears hurting, but I do think that I could wear the Linkbuds even a bit longer just because they are extremely lightweight. They even come with 5 different sizes of wingtips. Plus, the hole in the center of the driver really makes you forget you are wearing earbuds! It's pretty amazing.<br/>-The xm4s, and in my experience almost every other pair of wireless earbuds with a silicone tip that creates a seal, will never reach the level of comfort given by open-designed earbuds.<br/><br/>BATTERY: 4<br/>-I was able to get about 5 hours on one charge of the earbud, which is right around Sony's estimated 5.5 hours. That is slightly above average for wireless earbuds and I haven't run into any problems with it yet.<br/><br/>CONTROLS: 4.5<br/>-The Linkbuds introduce a new type of control where you tap the sides of your head to pause, play, skip, or activate other functions you can set in the app. At first, I was fully expecting this to be a gimmick, but then I noticed myself using it constantly! On top of that, I haven't noticed any issues with false touches, and now I love the feature! I only wish I could set more than 4 different functions.<br/><br/>VOLUME: 4<br/>-These buds don't get very loud. I don't listen to music very loud so they get plenty loud for me, but if volume is one of your main concerns then all the other buds I have previously mentioned get much louder than you would ever need.<br/><br/>SOUND LEAKING: 2<br/>-The Linkbuds leak a lot of sound, even compared to AirPods or the Buds Live. This is to be expected since there is a literal hole in the middle of the driver and there is nothing to stop the sound from going out, but just be aware that if you are listening to something above 65% volume, then someone in the same quiet room will probably be able to hear it a bit.<br/><br/>PAIRING/CONNECTIVITY: 4.5<br/>-For Apple products, you just need to go to your bluetooth settings and click the device to pair them.<br/>-For a full Apple ecosystem, the AirPods are a bit easier to connect and reconnect over multiple devices, but not by a large margin. For any other device, these are some of the best options for connectivity. Just press the button on the back of the case and they will enter pairing mode, and for Android users they will pop up and ask if you would like to pair without even going into settings.<br/>-I would have liked to see multipoint connection, but it is still a fairly rare feature in earbuds so I can't be too mad. On the bright side, they are easy to reconnect between multiple devices.<br/><br/>CASE: 5<br/>-The case is adorable! It's a bit thicker than the Airpods case, but still very small and can easily fit in almost any pocket without issues. When you place the buds in the case, they actually click into place, making them feel a lot more secure than a lot of other wireless earbuds.<br/><br/>UNIQUENESS: 5<br/>-The reason I love the Linkbuds so much is because they do a lot of things that no one has attempted before. The biggest one is the donut-shaped driver. Even when compared to AirPods, Buds Live, and other open-designed earbuds, these stand out as not only the best sounding but also the most natural. When I am having a conversation with someone, I never once felt the need to reach over and take these out of my ear. The hole gives a direct channel from the outside to my ear canal, making these incredible for having a conversation or hearing your surroundings without taking them out.<br/>-I also want to acknowledge Sony's efforts to reduce its carbon footprint. The buds are made using recycled plastics and rubbers, and the packaging is very minimal and contains no plastics. It is amazing what impact companies can make when they make efforts like these.<br/><br/>PRICE: 5<br/>-For a pair of earbuds with this much innovation and sound quality, I think $180 is a very fair price.<br/><br/>CONCLUSION: 4.5<br/>The Linkbuds offer something really special. If you are a huge basshead or want noise-canceling, then I would recommend looking at earbuds with a sealed silicone-tip design. However, if you are looking for a pair of open-designed earbuds like the AirPods or Samsung Buds Live, then I would easily recommend the Linkbuds every time. The comfort, sound quality, and uniqueness set these far apart from all other similar earbuds. When I reach for a pair of open-designed earbuds, the Linkbuds are the ones I grab 99% of the time, and that means a lot.</span>

<span>I love these earbuds! They are my go to for when I want to listen to music, podcasts, or generally anything I don't want to bother anyone else with but still be able to listen for doorbells, or have a conversation with someone.<br/><br/>Sound Quality: Remember when we used to have those wired earbuds from Sony or JVC or Panasonic that came with those foam covers that we always used to lose? That's what these sound like, but slightly better - very slightly. Mids and highs are good, don't expect much, if any, bass. There is some low frequency response but it's very airy. These are no audiophile earbuds folks! Only audio codecs available are SBC or AAC. These are akin to Apple's Airpods - they are completely open, no sound sealage, no noise cancellation, but sound quality is definitely not bad if you know what to expect. But if you do get a chance to listen with these it's a different experience. Like music or voices are only playing for you, but you're not completely sealed off from the world. Your own personal soundtrack can play in the background as you go about your day. As mentioned before, the LinkBuds only offer SBC or AAC audio codecs, which is fine. Why waste AptX or LDAC capabilities on open earbuds? You lose more detail with the earbuds designed to be completely open. With the Headphones app you can turn on the function to upscale compressed audio via AI with the DSEE option. I honestly didn't notice any huge difference with it being on or off.<br/><br/>Build Quality: ABS material, though they feel very sturdy. The recycled plastic look has its own charm. Definitely a different look and feel, but you can tell Sony really tried to go environmentally conscious with everything, from the materials to the packaging. Besides the silicon inside the buds, it feels like it could be recycled again (if that makes sense). They don't feel cheap by any means. The buds are lightweight, probably some of the lightest I've used. Overall good build.<br/><br/>Battery Life: Battery life is good. I would say average. About 4-5 hours of continuous music listening, with an additional 2-3 full charges from the case. Just recently got the Xperia 1 III which they added battery share (reverse Qi charging), which is interesting to me since the case for these earbuds didn't include Qi charging capabilities. Sony s WF flagship does, but these do not. Hopefully if they make a LinkBuds ver. 2 they add it.<br/><br/>Fit and Comfort: Just like any new earbuds, getting the fit right requires some trial and error (and sometimes a little bit of discomfort). The LinkBuds come with 4 (I think, can't remember) different sized wings that help keep the earbuds in place. My ears are somewhat smaller, so I typically use either small or medium eartips and wings. For these I had to switch the preinstalled mediums for one size smaller. At first the wings are a bit too stiff and uncomfortable. But after breaking them in they're perfect! The LinkBuds stay in place, even with more than normal head shaking. Although the shape of these earbuds are unorthodox, once you understand how they need to be placed in your ear they fit well. Compared to the Samsung Galaxy Buds Live I find these MUCH more comfortable but a little more pressure than Airpods.<br/><br/>Features (Headphones App): The Wide Area Tap apparantly isn't a new function, but it is a niche one. The way it works is instead of tapping directly on the buds themselves, you double or triple tap an area around an earbud for it to trigger an action. In the Headphones app you can assign area taps for each side, but only limited to a specific function. For example, for the left area you can assign the Volume function, so 2x tap will be set to Raise Volume and a 3x tap will Lower Volume. And for the right area you can set something like Playback Function, where 2x tap will Skip Song Forward, 3x tap will Previous Song. You cannot, however, set left area to function as 2x tap volume up 3x tap previous song. It's only left/right area tap set functions (Volume, Playback, Assistant, etc). There is Adaptive Volume Control which raises the volume automatically when you're in a louder area such as outside where there's traffic, and lowers volume when you're in a quieter are such as a library. Then there are your typical earbud functions, such as Auto Power Off when nothing plays through the earbuds after a certain amount of time passes, or Auto Pause when earbuds are removed from your ears. In the app you can mess around with the equalizer, set up 360 audio, set voice to speech, and set voice notifications.<br/><br/>Connection: Now this is my biggest gripe with the LinkBuds. I have the Headphones app set to prioritize a good connection at the sacrifice of sound quality, but noticed if there are any large masses that get in between my phone and the earbuds (like, say, my fat body) the earbuds cut out. This especially happens outside, I've noticed, while I'm gardening or washing the car. Sometimes the interference also cuts out audio in the left earbud. And it's not just for a second or two, it could be until I pause my music and try reconnecting the buds, needing to place them back in the case and restarting the connection to my phone. It can be very frustrating at times - hopefully there's a patch coming.<br/><br/>Overall, very good first foray into this design by Sony. I hope they continue to refine this line of earbuds. I know their flagships have settings to allow passive audio but normally those sound too robotic - having open audio is more my preference.</span>

<span>Let's get this out of the way: These are not your all-purpose earbuds. I have TMJ issues (jaw joint) that have made it effectively impossible to wear normal headphones while using my computer - like I had for years - without pain, so I use these instead. Normal earbuds closing off the ears for hours at a time is uncomfortable and not great for the ears. My point is, if you do not have a specific reason to need this design, you should not buy them. They are a compromise compared to regular true wireless earbuds costing half as much. With that said, for their intended purpose, these work pretty well.<br/><br/>AUDIO:<br/>Sound quality is excellent, detailed and well-balanced (as long as they're not pushed too hard... see below on volume). You will not get a lot of bass. You can hear the bass tones, especially if you add some boost, so the dynamic range isn't lost - but it's not going to thump in your ears. I did find that enabling bass boost (in Windows for my use case, or in the phone app for phone use) helped the overall sound balance. Music sounds slightly hollow to my ears without it.<br/><br/>I see the popular review about volume - I have not experienced this in my quiet apartment use case. They have plenty of volume even though Windows bass boost cuts the overall volume down. I keep them at 50-60% volume on my computer, and I tested them on my phone (Pixel 6 Pro, for what it's worth) and settled on roughly the same volume. 100% volume is uncomfortably loud, and also noticeably affects quality (at least on PC, I can't recall if it was the same on the phone). If you are trying to use these in a particularly loud environment, they might not work well.<br/><br/>BLUETOOTH:<br/>I have had no issues with connection quality within a short range (i.e. typical usage range). However, if I walk to my bathroom on the other side of my tiny 1-bed apartment, which places the utility closet (and thus quite a bit of metal) between me and the computer, the connection starts dropping in and out. I have cheaper earbuds that are able to maintain a connection there. Not a big deal, and most people use earbuds with their phone which is on their person, so this is pretty unique to me.<br/><br/>They do not have multi-point. While I am not the type of person to field many phone calls, I can see this being annoying for someone who does if they're using them the way I am, on the computer. Teleworkers in particular might consider this a deal-breaker if they take a lot of work calls. As it is, you'd have to pop one earbud out and answer the phone normally, or use speakerphone, rather than the convenience of the earbuds providing both sound from the computer and calls from the phone.<br/><br/>These do not support LDAC. With the audio limitations inherent to this design, I suspect it simply wasn't worth enabling - LDAC uses more power.<br/><br/>BATTERY:<br/>Speaking of power, the battery life on these is... not great, not terrible. To be fair, Sony isn't hiding anything here - look at the battery life ratings between their true wireless options and it is obvious that these are not designed to have a particularly long life. I haven't precisely measured, but I would guess that they are true to their 5+ hour rating.<br/><br/>I do wish they lasted longer, but it's not the end of the world. The fast-charge feature makes it so that occasionally taking a short break and sticking them back in their case is sufficient to keep them going effectively indefinitely. If your use case involves really long periods of uninterrupted use, these might not be your jam.<br/><br/>FIT / COMFORT:<br/>The big one. Fitting these properly is EXTREMELY important. I cannot overstate how much proper fit matters for both sound quality and comfort. Until you learn how to fit them, you cannot just pop them in and go, like traditional earbuds. They will sound bad, be horribly uncomfortable, and/or fall out.<br/><br/>I suspect reviews related to extremely poor sound quality (tinniness), falling out, etc., are mostly related to not taking the time to find the correct position and fit ring, minus the rare exceptions for certain people's ears just not working with these. Play around with them, try out different size fit rings, adjust the positioning to find that sweet spot where they're comfortable and the sound isn't tinny. This wasn't something I succeeded in doing on the first day I had them. It took a few days for me to figure it out. But now that I've learned, I *can* just pop them right in (mostly... maybe a tiny bit of fiddling). They are comfortable enough for me to wear for several hours, but I wouldn't say they entirely disappear.<br/><br/>FEATURES:<br/>I do not use the few music apps that support their 360 audio, nor do I use them for phone calls, nor do I use them where I would need the speak-to-chat pausing or adaptive volume, so I can't speak to any of those features. They're all there though!<br/><br/>The phone app has an equalizer, it does equalizer things. As mentioned in the audio quality section, it has a separate bass boost, which I recommend playing around with if you're using them with your phone.<br/><br/>There are only two tap functions (double tap and triple tap), which honestly sucks. I don't understand why so many otherwise competent earbud designers refuse to offer more functions. Since I use these with the computer, I rarely need to actually use the tap functions, so it doesn't really matter in my use case. It probably will matter for most people, though.<br/><br/>The Wide Area Tap feature is theoretically very cool and responds to taps well. That might sound great, but the problem is that it also false triggers constantly for me. Eating something? Okay, track skipped. Several tracks, actually, because you didn't stop eating. Yawned? Got it, you want to pause your music. I went to the trouble of installing the app and temporarily connecting them to my phone *just* to turn the feature off. It was driving me nuts.<br/><br/>VERDICT:<br/>See the title. These are compromised by design, but the design exists to accomplish a very specific goal, opening up the ear. If you need that, you should give these a try. If you don't, there is no reason to buy these.</span>

<span>Got these renewed a few days ago, since I didn't know whether I wanted to go full price considering they are an odd form factor and there are some mixed reviews. However, after a few days of adjustment period I really do love them. I bought them specifically for using when riding around on my bike (since I need ambient sound awareness when biking around traffic in the city) but I am finding out many other times that are perfect for using these and I gravitate towards them - around the office, when I am out and about walking the dog, when sitting at the airport waiting for my flight to start boarding, etc.  The ability to hear your surroundings is great, and if you pump up the volume you still can drown out most of the ambient noise if you choose to.<br/><br/>The sound is great for the use we are talking about - it's a very pleasant sound signature, with clear and supple mids, and the highs rolled back a bit to match the fact that you will get a lower bass depth and punch than if you were using an in-ear with sound isolation. Let's be clear - if you want a set of earbuds that give you a meaty, thumpy bass these will be extremely disappointing. The bass is more or less hinted at, but not really very present - there's enough that the mix is not weird, but if you want that visceral thump of bass that hits in the chest, look elsewhere. But for casual listening while out and about, podcasts, pop, etc. they are really excellent. And like with any other set of headphones, once you start listening for a while and adjust to the sound, your brain fills in the rest. So you won't be missing much for casual listening.<br/><br/>The fit takes a couple days to master. There's a tendency when you first get them to want to try to jam the speaker wheel closer to your ear canal to get more volume / bass, but that's not the way these go. Basically, keep the fin vertical at at 12 o'clock position and have them rest in front of the ear canal lightly. Once you get used to the fit, they are extremely comfortable, especially as you will not experience any of the "ear suck" common with in-ears.<br/><br/>Battery life so far is good - after listening for an hour ad mid-volume I've lost about 12-14%, so that's more than adequate. The box is a bit fiddly, but I appreciate that the buds fit in securely with a noticeable clack, so you know they are charging and secure in their beds. The app works really well, I do recommend turning both Adaptive Volume Control (which dials up the volume to overcome ambient noise) and Wide Area Tap (which allows you to control the buds by tapping in front of the area). I also appreciate that there's a lot of configuration options for each earbuds gestures - I set mine up to control volume with the left bud, and playback with the right one and that works really well. Also, voice calls are excellent I am told.<br/><br/>All in all, great little buds, and definitely fantastic for uses where you want to have some awareness of your surroundings...</span>

<span>An update to the review I made earlier with some added issues.<br/><br/>I have been daily driving these with some success but with some issues. Main thing being that most of the time it has disconnection issues is when my phone is moving while being interfered by pants, jacket, vests and backpack. I tried the method that jlab sends you in the box of reconnecting and pairing them again but it just reverts back to the same issue. I think that one headphone gets a clear connection to the phone and then the other doesn't get the same connection range and it just gives up until it can get the connection again. Other than those issues though the sound is great but I suggest that you find out how to change the internal equalizer as it's usually better than your phones version and you don't have to rely on the phone or app to do the hard work. It does charge easy but the main issue with me is that the markings can't be read in the dark so you have to guess. Eventually though you just figure out which one belong in which ear after using a few weeks. The headphones also don't charge on my battery bank no matter how many times i flip and move things around. The usb just doesn't get detected by my battery bank so it might do the same to you. It does charge on other things like laptop, wall charger and usb extensions. They do however just have a long running time of 20+ in my experience. I didn't charge them for 4 days and it finally gave up with just one earphone having 20% charge on the 4th day using them for 6 hours at a time.</span>

<span>I purchased these after trying a different pair of air-pod looking buds (cheaper ones) that just weren't comfortable and stuck down below the ear. These fit nicely so they don't come flying out if I have to take off a mask, helmet, etc. The sound quality seems good, although I'm not sure they're the best on offer at this price point. The comfort is pretty good after an initial adjustment period. I generally prefer in-ear types, to be fair.<br/><br/>The noise cancellation is minimal.<br/><br/>I like the no-button touch control but samsung has elected to tie a lot of functionality to their app which, predictably, requires all sorts of permissions to work. One additional issue I have with these is that you cannot seem turn them off via touch. You have to put them in the charging case, use the app (maybe?), or disconnect bt via your phone. I'd much prefer if there were a way to turn them off by simply holding them for a few seconds like most button-based devices.</span>

<blockquote><em><div class="a-row a-spacing-small review-data"><span class="a-size-base review-text review-text-content" data-hook="review-body">
<span>To get started I am going to discuss how these felt at the beginning. When I first put these on, I had a difficult time getting to putting the buds in my ears. It was not very intuitive. I could get it to stay put after moving it around for while. It felt comfortable once in but if I were to take it off the same struggle would occur for the next 15 times. Once I got use to it was a little easier. Once I got use to it I was moving around doing chores, and it felt comfortable. Then i bent over and the bud felt out of my ear. I then switched to the larger wing tips. Once those were in it did feel a long more secure but in exchange i felt the presence of the buds a lot more. I have had them in my ears like 8-9 hours today, and yes my ears do feels a little tired. Touch controls are very sensitive. Usually with other buds, when my ears are fatigued and i use touch controls, it would hurt quite a lot since you are pushing the silicone tip further into your ear with every press. With these buds, while fatigued, the press of the touch control does still inflict some pain, but not nearly as much. I am not no way an audiophile, but i find the audio more than satisfactory. The ANC feature does not cancel out noise as many would expect. Where the ANC comes into handy is sound quality and phone calls. I made a couple of phone calls and asked the person how the audio sounds after ANC on and off with a fan blowing on my face. They all said it sounded extremely better with it on. Another area where I find these buds great is in low latency. Yesterday before I got these buds, i was mirroring amazon prime to my Roku through my phone. You typically cannot connect bluetooth headphones directly as they only connect to Roku Speakers. However, what you could do is private listening on the roku. This is where you play the audio of the Roku TV on your phone. This is where you can pass the audio to your Bluetooth headphones. Yesterday, I was using my overear headphones Sony WH-1000XM2 for that audio. The latency is this context for the Sony's was horrible. Not even close to anime voices that i was watching. With the Galaxy Buds Live, there is not latency whatsoever. Even without the low latency feature. Now I'm going to discuss battery life. The battery life dropped to 16% after just a few hours of use. This saying 3 or 4 hours. However, i was actively listening to music and testing Bixby through these headphones, with ANC on. This was with ANC and Voice Wake-Up on the entire time which will drain the battery dramatically. I charged it completely probably sometime under an hour. My final rant is going to be the Bixby Voice Command. Eventhough i do not use any voice assistant on my Galaxy S9+. I believe Bixby has major potential. In my opinion it could be one of next moves to a greater Samsung ecosystem. The main selling point of Bixby is that it has tight integration with the settings in Samsung Devices. It does it far better than most of the other assistants, but still not good enough. Now, in my opinion, with the Galaxy buds live it is worthless. It did follow some commands to play certain songs on YouTube and to play the next song. However, it fails in the most basic command that the majority of us will use. Volume up and down. It failed everytime to turn down and up the volume. This is something that could be fixed with a software update later down the line. If Samsung is going to push Bixby on to us by not allowing us to switch assistance (without the press of a button that is), then please get these basics right! I feel like this is a great opportunity for Samsung to improve on Bixby to able to closely compete with at least with Siri and the Google Assistant giant. One little last comment on the fit, these stay extremely comfortable in my ear far more than its predecessors. After a couple of hours in the ear, the buds will tend to shift away from the correct position. You will need to move it back but nothing to extreme. I hope my review help those wanting to buy these buds.</span>

<span>Sound quality is great! And they are very comfortable. You can forget their even in. Downsides is for me that it seems like my ear produces more for a lack of better word, ear wax trying to remove the foreign object out of my ear. You'll have to continuously push them back in your ear while running. Then the song will pause or skip. And once your hands get moist from sweating it's nearly impossible to pause or skip to the next song. And if your hair gets damp it will pause the song when it bounce up against the buds while running. Would have given 5 stars if smaung sold the case separately if you lose it. Or be able to replace one bud if lost.</span>

<span> After hearing the buzz and seeing the leaks on these over the last few months, I was anxiously awaiting their release.<br/><br/>Now, with them in hand (or ears, rather), I have some serious concerns.<br/><br/>I wanted these for the use of listening to music and equally, if not more importantly,  for hands free phone calls.<br/><br/>For the record: I have paired these with my Samsung S8 phones. I have alternated between two S8's and have found identical results<br/><br/>Being a 100% Android and anti-Apple consumer, I can honestly say that Apple got it right with the AirPods.  Not only for sound but for call transmitting and receiving audio quality.  The Galaxy Buds Live may not be up to the same level in the call quality department.<br/><br/>Call Quality:  From my first call, the audio I heard from the caller sounded quite good. Then the audio I was hearing began to sound a bit distorted and I kept experiencing a lot of digital noise. What I found is, if I put my phone in my pocket, or I'm holding my phone and I put my hand down by my side, it almost seems like I lose connection or there is interference. As if the signal is poor. But, if I'm holding the phone upright, or almost right near my face, the sound seems fine. Shouldn't be like this.  On the plus side, in comparison with my Bose headphones, multiple callers said these sounded equally as good on their end.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, I have to rate the call quality as Very Bad at this point. After being sent a second pair, same exact issue.<br/>I am curious if this is some form of a software incompatibility issue with the Samsung Galaxy S8.  Because the call quality is so poor, and I intended on using these heavily for calls, these are now likely to be returned.<br/><br/>The Fit:  Very interesting but nice. They're light, comfortable and once you trust that they won't fall out, you really feel like they're not even there.<br/><br/>Music/Audio:  Sounds great. I'm not a $1000 headphone audiophile.  It needs to sound clear with your highs and mids defined and just good in general. Sound quality is very good. Here's the catch was that though. I started noticing the same signal issue that I was noticing with the call quality. While I was watching/listening to a YouTube video and I put the phone in my pocket or I walked away from the phone, mind you only a couple feet away, it seems like there's interference or the reception is bad. It cuts out constantly. Again, this shouldn't be happening.<br/><br/>Active Noise Canceling:  I'd have to say that my Bose QC35ii's are my benchmark for ANC. That bar is pretty high.  The Galaxy Buds Live disappointingly offer little in terms of ANC technology.  If you're looking for the same level if ANC that you get from a good pair of over the ear or in ear silicone tip ear buds, this will not measure up.<br/><br/>I experimented with this.  While sitting indoors, in a relatively quiet setting, you almost feel like you notice the ANC effectiveness.  Walking down the street with moderate car/traffic noise, I noticed absolutely no ANC effect. Merely an automatic battery drain at best.<br/><br/>Wearable App:  Good.  It would be nice to have a more dynamic equalizer option rather than the "canned" sound profiles.<br/><br/>Overheating:  I've yet to actually find information on this in the manual, but I believe that they have an overheating prevention feature where the individual earbud will begin beeping continuously in your ear. The audio playing, in my case a podcast, doesn't stop but a continuous beep begins. Not being able to figure out why, my best guess is that this is an overheating warning. I had been sitting outside and my left side was facing the sun. It was not excessively hot out and the actual left earbud did not feel warm or get warm in my ear. However, it repeatedly kept beeping.<br/><br/>General Performance:<br/>- In the home office and around the house: Not bad. I enjoy the lightweight design. As long as my phone is in front of me and not in a pocket, audio and call reception and quality are good.<br/>- On the elliptical: Nice. Comfortable and stay in place. Slight movement as you build a bit of a sweat.<br/>- Outside for a walk: ANC is non-existent. I also notice wind noise if it's a little breezy. By breezy, I mean a very light and intermittent wind. Not a hurricane.<br/>- On a bicycle ride: Crazy wind noise. Very off-putting, unfortunately.<br/>- Online Microsoft Teams Meeting (Android App on S8): I was told that I sounded distant and the audio was thin. As soon as I disconnected and called the person directly, they said I sounded great.<br/><br/>Summary: Very disappointed at this point. This is primarily due to the reception issues.  The price point is great for what I had expected. However, for what they are, I'd just as soon spend much, much less for a set of wireless headphones since making calls with these simply doesn't seem to be a good feature, out of the gate.<br/><br/>After running through all of the same with two separate sets of GBL's, using two different S8's, I've gotten identical results. I'm hoping that perhaps this may just be an S8 compatibility issue, as indicated earlier. I would enjoy editing this review to be nothing short of incredible, in the future.<br/><br/>Because they are so new, Samsung telephone support couldn't be all that helpful. With these being, literally, on the market for only a couple of days, there wasn't a whole lot of trouble shooting assistance available.<br/><br/>At this point, I've gone through two sets of these and have not seen a difference between the two. I'm torn whether or not I should return them. I so badly want them to work out. But, I'm finding that they're just not measuring up.</span>

<span>I had a 1st gen pair of AirPods whose battery failed so thought I would try these as an alternative for a fraction of the cost.  They sound better than my AirPods...they are NOT noise canceling (passive or otherwise), which is what I wanted for outdoor use so I could hear surrounding traffic, etc.<br/><br/>The sound is excellent, with frequencies that I can normally only hear on my 50mm over ears audible.<br/><br/>My only complaint isn't the fault of the headphones as far as I know and is a moot point if you plan to use with a single device - if you pair them to multiple devices, be prepared to have to toggle bluetooth off on all but the desired one until they have connected.  There is no hand-off like you get w/ Airpods (perhaps this isn't part of the bluetooth spec, but it seems like this could easily be implemented in software the same as it is for Apple's own hardware).  It never fails that these things pair with the device that is physically farthest away from them first (did I mention that they have good range?) and I'm running all over the house turning bluetooth off on different things.  The JBL app I downloaded seemed out-of-date and served only as EQ for different (older?) models, and perhaps is a missed opportunity to make up for Apple's shenanigans here.</span>

<span>I often wear these for my 8hour shifts. I move around alot, often walking quickly and they stay in my ears well and the sound quality is just okay but it works great for my podcasts and other stories.<br/><br/>Though, the rubber bit around the speaker does want to fall off and makes it much less comfortable to wear. A tiny tiny drop of glue under it fixed it somewhat but Its not the same as when it was new.</span>

<span>I was most concerned on whether or not it would stay in my ears. That it did. The only issue if you want to call it that is trying to pair it with a Samsung tablet, the tablet asked for a pin. All indications are there isn’t a pin, I’m thinking this was a Samsung tablet issue. Either way it worked fine. Happy with the results so far.</span>

<span>I love everything about these buds but I can’t get them to fit or stay in my ears. They fit for few minutes then when I’m moving around they fall out. And they don’t seal completely for the best sound because the sizes of ear pieces don’t fit my ears.</span>

<span>Just to start off, I bought these to be my work horse earbuds so I don't wear out my Cambridge Audio Melomania Touch buds. The brand, price point, sound quality and battery life are what drew me to them and they definitely do not disappoint.<br/><br/>They sound good out of the box but do benefit from tuning them with a devices sound settings. They have great lows and mids but the highs need a little adjustment. Music and video content are terrific. I especially had a lot of fun watching Marvel movies while using these as the lows and mids really shine.<br/><br/>Call quality is great and the mic is funtional. People on the other end of a call had no trouble hearing me, just don't expect them to be perfect. They work and that is fine with me.<br/><br/>The battery life for these are amazing when connected to a phone/tablet but suffer a little when connecting to other bluetooth transmitters, such as a dongle attached to a ps4. Couldn't get the full 8 hours when used that way but a phone/tablet is spot on at 8 or more. This may be an issue with my equipment, not the earbuds.<br/><br/>They fit great in my ears and this is the first set of earbuds that fit perfectly out of the box without having to change out the ear tips. I can also wear these all day without ear fatigue which is a huge win in my book.<br/><br/>The physical buttons work well enough and are a nice change from the touch type. I suggest gripping them slightly with two fingers and using a third to press the buttons, as just pushing on them causes the ear tips to move deeper into the ear canal.<br/><br/>The earbuds connect very easy and quickly and switch between devices very seemlessly which is a great change from my very finicky Cambridge Audios.<br/><br/>The charge case is really great but my only gripe is that the spring in the hinge is a little on the weak side so the case closes just a tad too easy. Though, the case magnet is amazing for both the flap and the earbuds and everything stays in place very well, even when accidentally dropped.<br/><br/>Now to the major issue I have is with JBL, not the buds themselves. JBL has made it a habit of not supporting a lot of their audio products and this model unfortunately isn't supported for their audio app. I have 3 different pairs of earbuds; Reflect, Live and Tune models and none of them are supported so there are no extra features or customizations available. The silver lining is that these earbuds just work right out of the box and won't require any software updates that could potentially ruin them in the future.<br/><br/>In conclusion, these are not your high end, high spec, feature rich earbuds that run over $200+ and are not really designed to be. They are solid, well made and incredibly functional. I picked them up for $60 on sale but feel that they would be worth the full $99 to anyone looking for a set of buds that will last and do the job.<br/><br/>Features missing for anyone interested:<br/><br/>-No noise canceling, only noise isolating due to the design of the ear tips going into the ear canal.<br/><br/>-No app support. Why JBL?<br/><br/>-Since no app support, no firmware updates which can be viewed as a good thing<br/><br/>-No ear wings to keep them in place, though I have not had them just fall out while talking, eating, smiling etc. Did not test them while working out/running.<br/><br/>-No transparency mode. If you want to hear things around you or have a conversation without hearing yourself inside your head, take one or both of them out.<br/><br/>-No noise cancellation for phone calls (the feature some buds have that clean up/isolate your voice and filter out background noise).<br/><br/>Again, the lack of these features to me did not come into play when purchasing and can be done without at this price point. Just wanted to make sure others knew before buying as there are other less expensive earbuds out there that are more feature rich but suffer from simple things like sound quality, ear fit and connectivity. Thank you for reading!</span>

<span>Apple AirPods Pro user here!<br/><br/>My AirPods started crackling and Apple would not replace them and I refused to pay $250 to have them replaced.<br/><br/>For the price point, these are well worth the money! In fact, I would have definitely paid $150 for these earbuds.<br/><br/>ANC is not quite as good as the AirPods, but still blocks out most background noise. The only thing I wish is that they had a toggle on/off for the ANC.<br/><br/>The sound quality is great! I’d say they are 100% on par with AirPod Pros (except without the crackling crap). Good bass without cutting out high frequencies. Good balance in the EQ’s, even without the high-def. drivers in the AirPod Pro’s.<br/><br/>The comfort level is basically as good. The only reason for me is because I switched so I was just used to the way the AirPods feel in my ears, so that’s just personal preference.<br/><br/>Most importantly, they have USB-C charging, something Apple does not have. This is where Apple is behind on a lot of things in their devices. But then again, their phones are the only ones that take thunderbolt 2’s, so it’s good marketing I suppose.<br/><br/>Great earbuds overall!</span>

<span>I bought these because i work dishtank at a restaurant, and tonight before i closed something bad happened. I had my right earbud in my left ear and left in my right, didn't notice like an idiot. There is a metal grate in front of the walk in dish area, where everyone is push all the stuff down into on the kitchen floor when we clean before leaving after close. I was sweeping over this nasty pitch black water with a metal grate over it. And i bumped my left ear by shrugging and shoulder barely touched my ear, earbud falls right out while standing over that grate. saw it fall through the grate into the nasty pitch black water my heart sank lol. I also heard it disconnect from my other earbud. Picked the grate up and swooped into the water with caution, pulled it out my first try thank god. Was very stressed out only had them for 4 days. That earbud wouldn't allow me to connect to it anymore so i thought it was all over. I put it in rice for 2 and half hours try to connect still not wanting to connect. then i tried something else, which was take the earbud that wasn't working anymore and put it into the charging pod, i did that and it lit up indicating it is taking a charge i was surprised. I then decided to take it back out, and it started to look for a bluetooth connection and connected right to my phone. Tested out the sound and it sounds all the same and just the same as the one that was never touched by water. So this product is amazing and glad i got it. the bass is good fits in my ear comfortably. i would def prefer these over apple earbuds i just like the sound quality more and how they sit in the ear just my opinion so yea if u ever water damage these just be quick in getting them out put in rice and let it sit, and put into charging pod to see if it will take charge, and it will work. Mine fell in the most disgusting water possible and was very lucky it still works gl and hope u enjoy the product as much as i do</span>

<span>I resisted wireless earbuds for a long time because I love my cheap wired pair that I've been rebuying for years, and was reluctant to purchase something pricy that I could lose so easily. But after  accidentally tearing my earbuds out of my ears three times last week because I forgot which order I put on my earbuds, mask, and sunglasses, I broke down and bought these.<br/><br/>I'm really happy with this purchase so far, particularly for the price. I can't judge it against more expensive competitors because frankly I'm not an audiophile so I can't really appreciate the sound quality enough to spend a lot on earbuds. My key requirements were as follows, in order:<br/><br/>- Price point and/or replaceability: Inexpensive was important but I particularly want to be able to buy individual buds if one goes missing. The Tile feature is a nice bonus over the original Dime and will hopefully further reduce my likelihood of having to pay for a replacement anytime soon.<br/><br/>- Size: I have tiny ears and usually struggle with finding buds that fit comfortable and stay in my ears. I have the smallest pads on these and they are comfy while still providing decent sound blocking. I also find they fit my ears a bit better/more securely if I wear them upside down in the opposite ears.<br/><br/>- Quiet operation: Might be goofy but I HATE when wireless devices have a talking start up assistant. I don't know why but it's the worst. These have one (unfortunately) but it's at least quiet and the message is short. Since the buds turn on when you take them out of the case, the assistant is usually done talking by the time I actually get them on.<br/><br/>- Battery life (sort of): I am sure there are earbuds with longer battery life but the case seems to have plenty to get through a day of use. Maybe I'll wish for longer battery eventually but for now it's fine.<br/><br/>- Sound quality: I've had wired earbuds that were cheaper with better quality. But these are wireless so I'm willing to cut them some slack. The sound is still clear and of a decent volume. The bass is good and I don't have to turn them up to max on the train.<br/><br/>Overall I think this is a great buy, as long as sound quality is not your primary interest. In that case you may be happier with a more expensive option.</span>

<span>I've been using these little buds for about 6 months now, and I couldn't be happier with the purchase. The grip in my ears is very good, I always use them when I jog in the mornings, and they never felt like falling off throughout all this time.<br/><br/>There is obviously not active noise cancellation, but the noise isolation coming from the earphone tips is quite good: using a little over half of the volume sometimes I cannot hear clearly the people speaking around me and the noises from coming cars are reduced in a quiet morning jog environment.<br/><br/>For the price you can't expect groundbreaking sound quality, but these little buds deliver a decent quality for the price, I use them to hear my podcasts in the morning, and they sound good for such a task.<br/><br/>Battery can be an inconvenience of small earbuds like these, but in my case I don't use to use them for longer than a few hours, and degradation doesn't mean evident after half a year of use.<br/><br/>I would appreciate a battery indicator for the case, it doesn't have any, and I've found myself trying to use the earbuds just to notice they're not at 100% because the case didn't have any battery on them. There were a few times as well when I couldn't use them at all because they had no charge and the case was also empty.<br/><br/>All in all I'm happy with their performance, quality and how they've endured through time and I probably would buy them again if I needed an extra pair.</span>

<span>The noise canceling on these bad boys really shines. The fit feels great, and the sound quality is excellent for a pair of ear buds. Download the LG TONE Free app and change your life by opening up all different kinds of listening options. It also allows for customization of the touch feature. Simply, a product worth your investment.</span>

<span>I took these on a recent international trip because I didn't want to have to worry about what type of headphones or connectors I was going to need to watch movies on the plane. I actually ended up bringing 3 sets (2 wireless and one wired) because I really need to listen to movies to help me relax and sleep on the plane.<br/><br/>The quality is good with these, although I would have to say I have a different pair from Sony that I prefer much better for sound quality. I also like the Sony ones better for working out. The LG's don't have the little wing that makes them feel more secure while working out.<br/><br/>The reason why I am still happy I bought these is because the ability to plug the case right into the plane screen is unmatched. I've tried separate Bluetooth receivers in the past on planes and have had hit or miss results. The LG's worked perfectly. Another nice quality is that the case is very small compared to my Sony's. It is easily pocket sized, but it is definitely nice to have something intended for travel to be so compact.</span>

<span>I purchased these earbuds to replace my Jabra Elite 65s after they stopped working. I was most excited about the feature that allows me to use a 3.5mm jack to project the sound from non-Bluetooth devices, though I'll admit I've only used that for testing purposes and haven't come across any real-life situations to use it in.<br/><br/>The case keeps a charge just fine as do the earbuds themselves, though I suppose we all would wish everything that runs on batteries lasted just a bit longer. The UV sanitization is a neat feature, but I would hope my ears aren't gross enough for that to be needed. It feels like an unnecessary component added for the marketing team but I won't complain that it's there.<br/><br/>I have dropped these on many occasions and have had no issues so far. The sound quality is great and the noise cancellation comes in handy when I want to block out noise in the office.<br/><br/>I hope one day future versions can be evaluated and given an NRR value as I would love to use them as hearing protection. I'm sure they work great for that but without an official rating it's not something I would recommend at this point if that's a consideration for you. However, the product does not claim to be nor does it suggest it should be used for hearing protection so I find no fault for not having the rating. It would just be nice to have in the future.</span>

<span>When I cut through the clear tape holding the box closed, I thought okay, another pair of ear buds.  I got this pair when I saw the video of Linus, showing how it was with a pillow.  I wanted something as a back up to my Boss Sleep buds, that I use at night.  My other Bose, was having battery issues after 5 months.  It was past there 90 day return policy.  These are thin on the side.  Haven't tried sleeping with them yet. But they don't bulge out.  If you go with these, download the app.  Adds features and you can see what is set.  Buttons are easy to operate.  I would grade 4.5 plus. I base a this off Jabra 75T.  With the Jabra, I can actually hear other conversations in the office, when I'm not sitting near those staff members.  hmm. an item to remember maybe when going out... night club...<br/>These are easier to place in the ears than Sony's XM4.  I donated the other older Bose., didn't want to try the new ones. ie. issues with the Bose Sleep., also had issue with the Bose over ear.  Had to return two different units on that item.<br/>These are much more solid than the Klipsch.  I do like the wireless charging pad., sort of the reason I kept the earbuds.  Thought the older Sport set, I do use at the gym.<br/>Now to the set being noted as New.  smile.  This set connected with my Samsung Tablet.  Without me even trying.  When I checked out the tablet, it informed me these were Angelia's LG Tones', smile.  When they connected with my Samsung Ultra, i renamed them.  I put the large Silicon ear tips on, which were in a plastic bag.  With the UV light that comes on, that warms them up., is a bonus.  If you pull out a earbud, they turn off.  Phone quality.  A co-worker I called was able to hear me really well.  I might try other ear tips I have to see if I can get a better seal.  I like my music.  I stream from 4 groups right now, so I have more variation.  Pandora, Qobuz, bandcamp-which is free and Amazon Prime.  I haven't tested these on any of my DAC's.  I usually wire in when using those.  Astell&amp;Kern is my light weight pocket fav. SR25 w/leather cover.<br/>Next is iBASSO Audio, DX240. easy to use.  The others are more warming bricks with short battery life.  I like this pair.</span>
