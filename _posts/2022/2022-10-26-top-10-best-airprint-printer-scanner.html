<span>UPDATE: I'm not calling a divorce lawyer, but am on the verge of packing a bag and going home to mother. Trying to Reader's Digest this as much as possible, the printer stopped talking to the PC. Every print job gave an error message and got stuck in the queue, I uninstalled and reinstalled constantly, posted on the user "help" forum,  ignored, then I found that instead of the printer icon, or the FAX version, that had downloaded, Microsoft IPP Class Driver (?) kept going to default so I tried printing with that, and it worked with Word and Adobe, but nothing else. No photos, no email. I tried the forum again and got such a condescending, idiotic response from a "moderator" -- you know the kind that never held any position of any authority at any time in life, and now has a picture of Putin hanging in their bedroom? No help there. I haven't called support yet because it's all just been too much in general these days, but it's still a neat little printer, when it wants to be bothered.<br/><br/>*************<br/><br/>I bought this printer with the sword of Damocles swinging above my head; my Epson printer reached its print limit, yep, you read that right, and could only be reused if I got it to Epson so they could change the pads in the ink waste tank (neither one of us is on anything, you're reading that right, and I'm telling it straight) and reset the print capacity, and for a cost higher than I paid for the foul thing - keep in mind, this is happening all in the middle of my business I actually took it apart and replaced the pads successfully with a kit from ebay, but the code to reset the counter was buggy as a picnic, so...in a panic, I bought an HP, and it was OK for a couple of weeks, until I had to use the scan function; FAX would have worked as well. If it worked. None of that downloaded with the regular printer software, and if you ever saw the circus of downloads that didn't work, no support, conflicting instructions...bless Amazon, they took it back and sent me this.<br/><br/>In the time it took me to use the "F" word in several languages while trying to get the HP to work, this little beauty downloaded everything perfectly, scanned beautifully and allowed me to finish up all my unfinished business. The touchscreen is clear and a good size, the text sharp, what an absolute relief. Of course, as with many honeymoons, this may go sour, and I'll let you know if it does, here, I'm not going to make a Tik Tok or ask strangers for their opinion on Reddit or anything...But so far, this is acting like a little gem.</span>

<span>This is the 2nd Cannon I bought (for a different location).  I am sick of making Hewlett-Packard rich because of the high cost of ink.  H-P is so intent on wanting you to waste ink by pestering you to print an alignment page every time you change cartridges.</span>

<span>This was a replacement for a Canon MX922 that suddenly died after 6 years. According to Canon, this is their current most equivalent model to the MX922, but even on paper it's clearly an inferior model. I was hesitant to purchase it, especially at 3x the price of my previous printer, but after much research, it was the most reasonably priced printer that had all of the features, and allegedly the quality printing, I wanted.<br/><br/>The printer is compact, which is the most positive thing I can say about it. As soon as I pulled it out of the box, I could feel how flimsy it is. I was so disappointed in the quality that I put it back in the box and desperately tried to revive my MX922; that was, sadly, unsuccessful.<br/>The top cover/adf is super light and feels like it could snap off. The front paper tray basically bends when you touch it and is so loose that it doesn't feel like it's actually attached to the printer. The full display panel needs to be flipped up in order to use the unit, but like everything else, it is not solid, and each time I move it, it feels wrong, like it's about to break, which I suspect is likely to happen.<br/>There is a rear paper feeder, which is supposed to be used for photo paper, envelopes, etc. It is a sad alternative to the dedicated photo paper tray of the MX922. Additionally, it claims to auto-detect paper once loaded, but it doesn't.<br/>I didn't have any issues with set up; it was pretty straightforward, and I was able to connect to my network with no problem. Documents print fine, and auto-duplex works. However, the print resolution is half of the MX922, which is not evident in documents, but is noticeable in photos. It also prints all photos slightly overexposed, which I am hoping to remedy by adjusting color management.<br/><br/>I am so bummed that THIS is the "replacement" for my sturdy, workhorse, quality-photo printer. Sadly, the MX922 is now a legacy model, so vendors who do have it are price gouging like crazy, or I would have purchased it again.<br/>The TR8620a is the perfect representation of how Canon is cutting corners to cut costs, while *not* passing the savings on to the consumer. No more Canon printers for me.</span>

<span>Choosing a printer/scanner to go with my 2020 M1 Macbook Air was a lot harder than choosing a laptop, but after much research and procrastination I went with the Canon PIXMA TS9520 and so far I have not regretted that choice. My very old HP device was not able to connect to my current network (although it did at a previous residence) so as a back-up I wanted a machine that could be connected to the laptop via a cable. They don't include the cable, but I purchased one from Amazon. So far I have not needed it. From box to completion it was a little over an hour for a mechanically/technologically challenged grandma.<br/><br/>Connecting to my network was a breeze (it didn't even ask for the password!), the ink cartridges went in easily, and the only issue I had was that the paper cartridge looked nothing like the paper cartridges my HP printers have had and I couldn't find it! I finally went online and found a youtube video that walked me through the process. In less than 90 minutes after I opened the box I had printed a test page and scanned a document. The automatic document feeder was very easy to use as well. The only negative I can report (and the reason I gave it four stars instead of 5) is that apparently this printer does not print labels (except for labels on printable CDs). I wish it did, but I can get along without that function. If you need to print address labels or lots of file folder labels that would be a problem. I think the adhesive backing is the issue. The documents it has printed for me are clear -- no smudges. I don't print photos or do much color printing, so I am hoping that most of the time I'll just have to replace the PGBK cartridge rather than the color ones. That is much less expensive. You can check the ink levels either on the display panel or on your computer (in Settings on a Mac). But Canon won't highjack your printer the way HP's Instant Ink seems to. At least I hope not!</span>

<span>I purchased this printer about a year ago, and ever since I’ve had issues with it, you might as well spend more money and buy a better printer or just buy a different brand altogether.<br/><br/> The printer is nice for basic things, but when it comes to anything besides computer paper expect to wait 5 to 10 minutes for a single sheet to print out, I purchased this printer to make prints of my artwork, when I scan them it takes up to two minutes, after that like I said it can take anywhere from 5 to 10 minutes for the machine itself to read your work and then print it.<br/><br/> I can’t even begin to tell you how many error codes, all the little things that this printer will do to stop itself from printing, I have lived in three separate places with this printer and it still can’t work with the Wi-Fi more than half the time.<br/><br/> Majority of the time it will stop printing halfway through and spit you out an error code or tell you that it can’t connect to Wi-Fi, and good luck using your phone with this it doesn’t wanna link up only when it wants to.<br/><br/> The printer prints out mediocre Prints, it may take 20 minutes but the majority of the color that you want to be there won’t be there I should’ve bought the Epson printer.<br/><br/> Overall when I spent $500 on this piece of junk a year ago, I did not know what I was getting myself into, canon itself can’t provide an accurate description so I had to get on QVC and watch two middle-age women present it to me.<br/><br/> Don’t waste your time with this printer. Unless you enjoy waiting an hour or two to print five pages, not to mention the feed slot on the back only excepts one piece of paper, have fun.</span>

<span>Sold by Olive Branch Enterprises in August 2021, if that makes a difference.<br/>I only ever got one good print out of this thing. It printed one test print, and then it broke.  This would probably be a great printer if it worked. I'll edit my review once I get the replacement, but if that ones bad too I'll be lowering all stars...<br/><br/>Then papers kept getting stuck in the roller when loading from the bottom try. I had to keep feeding it, paper would get stuck, flip it around, unload it from the back, pull paper out, replace backing. This went on for at least half an hour, never figured out why it couldn't just take one paper. But even when I gave it just ONE paper, it STILL got stuck.<br/><br/>Okay fine, had to take another 30 minutes to figure out how to load it from the REAR TRAY (because it would yell at you to put paper in the bottom, as it only wanted to print from the bottom tray) At this point I think the printer is sentient, and it gets angry that I want to load from the rear tray.<br/>Once I figure out how to load ONLY from the rear tray (its hidden in settings from the PC program somewhere, can't just tell the printer itself to do it) So then lets try a simple test print of the words "testing" just on the top and bottom of the page, BUT NOW its taking forever! Why?<br/><br/>It's also printing a gray bar on the side of the paper! Why? I HAVE NO CLUE. At this point I've already done ALL OF the troubleshooting, cleaned all the nozzles, run several check through each maintenance option WHICH WASTES LOTS OF INK, THANKS, and it's still doing it. Then I even manually looked at it and checked the ink cartridges, quick wipe down of where the paper runs through to make sure theres no ink. Still, it prints invisible lines.<br/><br/>Also, it would never connect to the wifi, even with hand putting in the password, which is too much effort to do more than twice.<br/><br/>I had my hopes up for this printer but this is the first time I've given up on a machine. I've got to return it. A brand new printer shouldn't be this much work. Literally, the thing should just WORK and PRINT, THATS ALL IT NEED TO DO when you get a BRAND NEW PRINTER!!</span>

<span>Ok, if you follow the installation instructions verbatim like I tried, you will get to a point where the printer is setup and the on screen menu is in a normal ready to use screen. The Manual then tells you to go to a web address for Cannon to install the drivers. The driver for this machine is not listed here, nor will the search find it. You are stuck.<br/>Instead, open your browser and do a search for Canon USA Downloads. Click on the official link from Canon. NOW enter the printer name which is TR8620. It will show 2 potential drivers. I used the the most recent date version. Click DOWNLOAD. Now your download file will have the file which is an executable. Run it. You will answer some basic prompts, then it it looks for the device on your network. Here is where the fun begins! If you followed the directions to the letter, the installer will not find your printer, and refuses to go any further. Its a little like my wife. What did you miss? NOTHING. Canon dropped the ball here. Let's fix it.<br/>Leave you PC alone for the moment. I have my Canon printer hooked up to a network using a cable as I have older non wifi computers using it. I plugged the cable in and thought I was done. Nope. Take a look at that fancy LCD screen on the printer. Notice how the WIFI and Network Icons are showing offline? Click on the little gear/wheel symbol on your printer LCD. Now the menu will bring yout o Device settings. Select enable LAN if you are using a network cable like I am. BOOM! Your Lan is now connected, and your PC install will now find and show the magical new printer on your network. CLICK ON THE PRINTER NOW. At the bottom of the install box you can follow the process and you are done. Repeat the software install for any other computers on your network. Done.<br/><br/>Now the printer itself-<br/><br/>Pros<br/>*Nice small footprint.<br/>*LCD screen is cute and big and very touch sensitive- nice!<br/>*As others have noted, the screen must be flipped up and paper output tray must be extended to print- not a deal breaker for me. Your mileage may vary on this issue.<br/>Install for the 5 ink cartridge's is simple and on screen beeps and pictures l;et you know you put them in correctly- nice!<br/><br/>Cons<br/>*Power cable is shorter than a politicians memory.<br/>* No network cable in box. Bring your own beer here.<br/>*Printer driver install and network instructions are non existent. This is really inexcusable for a home product with all us non techies out there. zero stars for Canon on this issue and your ratings are getting hammered for it.<br/><br/>I will complete my review and update later. I wanted to get this out to the new owners who are frustrated with their install :)<br/><br/>Overall I think it has proper value for price point and use case. Very quick for what it is. So far I'm happy after the software install episode fades from my mind... I would purchase again and gave it 5 stars.<br/>*While the price point for this model is lowish, I do find the face panel that the LCD is part of extremely bad looking- you can see parting lines and mold finishing haze in it - very very low quality- but functional enough. Its kind of a 15 yard beauty if you will.<br/><br/>UPDATE 3/9/2021<br/>The photo printing quality is fantastic IMHO.  The single sheet feeder in the rear takes you paper after you follow the on screen instructions of flipping a paper guide, loading paper, flipping it back. Not designed for running multiple copies quickly- but perfect for home users. The speed is amazing and was dry.<br/><br/>The copier is a simple affair. Open the cover, place document on platen and hit scan. LCD will ask you where to send it. It will go to several cloud choices or a PC folder as a PDF. Very quick and easy.</span>

<span>I thought the initial set up was too easy! Got it up and running only to find it was not holding WiFi Connectivity. Didn’t find online fixes helpful and ended up uninstalling and reinstalling.

Make sure you take a look at your desired Automatic Shutdown setting… unless you use Automatic Wake-up when print job requested you’ll have to power the unit back up yourself. Once past initial problems I’m pleased with value of this printer.</span>

<span>I particularly like the document feed. This I need for thicker paper. It’s also has a cartridge feed which for normal copy paper; works fine.<br/><br/>This model is almost exactly like the last model I owned, I don’t recall the number, and they both have one annoying feature which is you have to wake it up. If I print from another room I have to get up &amp; go into the office and press the button. There is a way to override this. I’m sure it’s something simple. I don’t install the software on all my devices and that’s probably why.<br/>I’m careful with ink, its expensive. I buy high-yield cartridges &amp; whenever possible print at 75% or smaller to save ink. It works very well. I don’t print photos so I dont know how well it performs.<br/>There is a suite of creative choices. I don’t really use them. I print invoices for the most part.<br/>I have found, and this is my third canon printer, after a couple years they just quit. One day they just don’t work anymore. This has happened to me twice but liked it well enough to purchase a third. I feel it is good for the money- a good economical product, a good value</span>

<span>I bought this during the early days of the pandemic.  My old Canon, that I could l lapse lyrical about, died.  I loved my old Canon.  When Canon's tech support guy and I could no longer get it to work properly, I bought what the tech support guy steered me to.  It was an emergency.  Thus begins the months of frustration - that are sure to continue until this damn machine dies.<br/><br/>It has taken me 2.5 months to be able to do simple things like get it print without borders.  You know - that simple thing where you put a piece of paper in the copier and it prints the page?  Not so easy with this one.  You have to use the back tray that is designed for envelopes and choose the paper called "matte."  Amazing.  Why didn't I think of that? That's just today's weirdness, though.<br/><br/>That bit where you pop on a thumb drive and hit scan?  Hah!  Not on this machine.  No USB drive. Moreover to scan, unlike the old Canon, you have to use some utility on your computer.  The Canon utility is designed much like the rest of the machine.  Difficult at best.<br/><br/>That bit where you just hit print on your computer and it does its thing?  Not this machine. It defaults to an energy save mode - which might make sense if you were warned about it and had instructions about how to turn it off... While running up and down the stairs to turn on the printer before printing and then running back to get the copy made me feel like I was in a bad early 1980's office job.<br/><br/>That bit where you just hit print on your printer? Nah. The button is on this flappy piece of plastic called a control panel that has to be flipped up so that the light hits you directly in the face because you need to look at to hit print.  In fact you need to stab that thing repeatedly and touch sensitive it ain't.<br/><br/>I could go on. And on.  Don't get me going about the rear paper feed.  Whoever designed this did bad, bad drugs.  Just buy another machine.  Your life will be easier.</span>

<span>I had to buy a new computer, so you know my trusty, good old printer doesn't work with the new computer..blah, blah, blah. I wanted double-sided printing, copying, and scanning, auto-wake when I printed/scanned, printer that holds at least 50 blank sheets, easy to use, and airprint capabilities. I wanted a workhorse, a printer that doesn't suck ink, doesn't stop working when one color of the ink is out, doesn't stop printing when half of the ink is still left in the cartridge, and doesn't require expensive ink. It's impossible to find all of that. WHY? Also, the video for this product says that this printer costs about $85 less than I paid for it (video says $130, I paid $209, and today it says $225).<br/><br/>I literally got sick of looking at reviews for printers (and being disappointed), had a ton of docs to print, and just settled for this printer. It prints double-sided, the print quality is nice, cheap ink is available, and it took 15 minutes from taking it out of the box to printing docs. Everything else I hoped for? No. Although, I've only had the printer for about a week, so I don't know if it sucks ink or only uses half the cartridge before it stops printing. For the price, swipe left. I wish that my options were better...I wish I would have had more patience and chose a less expensive printer with the same substandard options.<br/><br/>If anyone has suggestions on the perfect printer, I'm more than willing to buy a different printer that doesn't give me more work.</span>

<span>I received this printer several days ago after my previous Canon Pixma died. That Canon printer was similar to this one and lasted four years and two changes of location. I did pay about $100 for that unit and selecting this one at half that price did give me pause.  After reading some of the other comments I admit to some hesitation but I'm happy to say the set-up and printing went as smoothly as possible. There were a couple of situations I had read about-failure of the unit to draw paper and difficulty getting a computer to recognize the printer-so I was on the look-out for those problems particularly.  Here's some observations: There are several orange pieces of tape and protective pieces of plastic that must be removed. This includes on the printer itself as well as the provided ink cartridges. And because the printer is mostly plastic it should be lifted and carried from the box by placing your hands on each side of the unit and not on the front and back. When loading the paper, don't overload it and be sure the paper guard is secured properly after loading the tray. Both issues can cause the unit to fail to draw paper. There is a booklet of instructions included as well as a download site to assist in set-up but I recommend using the included DVD if you have a DVD slot on your computer. This eliminates almost all decision-making including accessing your wireless router. In other printers I've had it was necessary to input the security key for your router which often led to difficulties and failure. No such problem exists here as it will automatically interrupt your router to secure the signal and turn it back on when completed. Before I began, I also deleted all files from my computer that were necessary for the previous printer. I can see where this set-up might have difficulty if previous files are present, particularly if you're installing a printer from the same manufacturer. Now, because I have a slow download speed, the entire set-up took more than 30 minutes and at times I found myself wondering if something had gone wrong as the set-up appeared stuck. But patience was finally rewarded as the set-up concluded.  The DVD will print a test page once your set-up is complete to determine if there is printer head alignment issue. This might be another area of issue for some people although it's easy enough to run a printer head alignment test if there is a problem. I didn't experience that either.  After my set-up I also was prompted by the DVD tutorial if I wanted to print from some other device-for me I wanted that option for my cellphone. That, too, was easy. I downloaded the app from Google play (I have an Android) and again, by following the prompts on my phone it connected immediately to my printer.  It was necessary to pick my printer from a list on the phone as well as picking the type of paper in the printer, but those were easy. I've since printed a number of various pages and not once have I experience a paper draw problem. Certainly if you're going to print a lot of pages and if you do that frequently, then this isn't the printer for you. But if you're like me, who occasionally prints a page or a few pages, then I highly recommend this printer. Yes, the ink is expensive, and what comes with the printer isn't a lot, but at this price for a reliable good printer, go for it. Hope this helps.</span>

<span>I received the printer yesterday and installed it today.  The first step was to remove all the protective tapes/films.  After I lifted up the cover/scanning unit to remove the orange tape, I can't close it.  Tried 5 minutes and I could not find any switch/flap.  I googled online and found many people complaining about the same issue.  One person offered his trick. At the end of the holding stick, there is a white turning wheel.  Use some tool to turn the wheel a few degrees and it should be able to close.  I tried a few times and it worked!  I was able to close the lid (with a squeaking sound) and continued the set-up.<br/><br/>The wifi set up for the first laptop was quick (using CD).  The smartphone also got set up quickly.  But the 2nd laptop (no CD-ROM) followed the method to download from canon website and it can't find the printer in wifi network.  So it worked for one laptop but not the other one.  I decided to use the first laptop to print what I need.<br/><br/>The test printing was good.  The first two sheets of paper printed out nicely.  I was happy with the quality.  Then a new problem came up: the printer complained the paper tray was empty and no paper was found.  I loaded about 15 sheets of paper and it just printed 3 pages!  I took out the paper, put it back, reinstall the paper tray, turned off the print and turned back on.  Tried everything for 10 minutes and still could not load the paper.  Finally I remembered there was a rear paper feeder and I inserted my paper there and it started to print.<br/><br/>Can't decide if I should return. It's a lot of work to return, order a new one and set up a new one and this one was finally printing with work-around.  I may keep it as long as it's printing.  But I would not recommend buying it.</span>

<span>Replacing HP 6700 that I received from a customer. This unit is quieter, faster, has larger ink cartridges. The paper tray is a little harder to figure out at first, but once you get it's god.Doesn't hold much paper in the lower tray. Starts up pretty quickly. Scans in color are very good&lt; including photos. The HP would rock back and forth for what seemed like minutes and do all kinds of internal checks. This unit fires up and is ready to go in less than a minute.<br/>Very pleased with print quality. I am not a heavy user. If you are, you may want more paper options as far as quantity. Other than that, a great print,scanner etc.<br/>Update:  May 31, 2019 The user menus on this thing are terrible. You can use the standard "Garden Menus" bu they are terrible. Mostly trying to get you to buy more supplies. A standard function for most of us it to"Rotate" an image.  On a standards scan, there is no easy way to just rotate the the image. You have to go into a Device settings menu and select to rotate it there. And only 180 degrees. No 90. The Image Garden menu won't let you select and image properties and I can't find a way to turn off their annoying software. Hey Canon, you DO NOT  know what I wan to do with my image. Especially text docs. And the default save locations is a pain to change also.<br/>The whole menu system needs to be redone. Never have I seen such a sloppy and clumsy menu.<br/>The device itself works great, but the menu system needs to reworked. And who ever approved this design needs to be demoted and sent back t to class. It's absolutely terrible.</span>

<blockquote><em><div class="a-row a-spacing-small review-data"><span class="a-size-base review-text review-text-content" data-hook="review-body">
<span>I can't say enough good things about this printer and the software. It's very simple to set up, the instructions are very clear. What is nice is that this printer comes with a full cartridge (some printers come with what is called a "starter" which is roughly half the page yield of a full cartridge). This is a B&amp;W laser printer which uses toner. The yield is I think something like 5000 pages? But since toner is powder, there's not really an expiration on it, unless the cartridge has some kind of weird exposure to heat or water. It's easy to copy, easy to scan, and the print time is ridiculously fast at it's default setting. Faxing is very simple as well, and the setup instructions are thorough.<br/><br/>I know there are complaints that this printer does not come with a USB cable. I used to sell electronics for a living, I've never seen a printer come with a USB cable. I'm not sure why manufacturers continue to do this, because it's literally the complaint I never stopped hearing as a sales associate, but there it is. It uses a standard USB printer cable (purchased separately), and comes with a phone line for fax and of course with the necessary power cable.<br/><br/>The scanning software is straight forward and easy to use also. I've used it several times to create PDF files of documents, and the autofeeder and scan rate is fairly fast as well. The time it takes to convert to a PDF file, even for a full color or greyscale scan is very fast. I've worked in a copy shop where I had to do scans on an industrial sized copier...this printer is actually faster.<br/><br/>The only downside is the weight, but that is to be expected when you get a high quality machine that has so many features. I had to buy a new desk, because the one I use currently for my desktop (and which has quite a bit of equipment on it already) would not be able to take the additional weight of this printer (approx 30 lbs).<br/><br/>The price was great for this also, given the quality and the features of this all-in-one. I purchased a similar model from Canon a few years back, and I think the price I paid for that on clearance was on par with what I paid on Amazon. I'm really pleased with my purchase, and recommend this printer highly.</span>

<span>Wow. What a great printer. I have been using HP printers for years and the quality has been going steadily downhill, so this Canon printer working well is a huge breath of fresh air. Here are some things I like about it.<br/><br/>PROS<br/>- Came with a cartridge.<br/>- Very fast print speed compared to inkjet.<br/>- Fantastic price. $110 for a multi-function b/w laser printer puts it in the same price category as premium multi-function inkjet printers.<br/>- Scans in color.<br/>- No bloatware during software installation.<br/>- Very little genuine cartridge nagging (yet), unlike HP software.<br/>- Scanning and other advanced features work smoothly over the network after installing some simple utilities.<br/>- Software isn't full of bugs and hard-to-change settings like the HP software I'm used to.<br/>- Refurbished cartridges actually work for laser, unlike inkjet, so replacement cartridges will only end up costing me $20.<br/>- According to my calculations, laser cartridges will print between 2x and 10x as many pages as an injket cartridge, which is a fantastic price per page.<br/>- Great packaging. A brown box on the outside, and a double-walled printer box on the inside. Styrofoam to prevent movement. Orange tape that left no residue to prevent compartments from opening. Clear plastic covers over all scratchable plastic surfaces.<br/><br/>CONS<br/>- Doesn't print color. Color laser printers are a bit too expensive, since they require 4 toner cartridges instead of 1, so I decided to go with this more economical b/w laser printer.<br/>- I accidentally bought a version with no wireless. No problem though. I like to wire my stuff anyway, so that I don't suffer from any intermittent connection issues.<br/><br/>So far I am very impressed with Canon. Out with HP, in with Canon, I say. I will update this review if anything crops up, but with such an auspicious start, I don't really expect any issues.</span>

<span>I have only had the printer 1 day but I am impressed with the printing speed. I always had inkjets before, this has to be 4 times the speed at printing. The setup instructions are terrible &amp; very incomplete if you never set up a laser before. I already found out the same as many reviewers in here, the Canon support is terrible. After setup I was getting a blinking error light and a message saying the toner was not a Canon toner &amp; it was not communicating. I called Canon support, told them the issue &amp; asked if there was something I may have missed in my setup, I did pull out the tab with the long clear strip on it. The tech said no, there is obviously a problem with the machine or the toner cartridge, call Amazon &amp; send it back.<br/><br/>I figured I would go over everything a second time before I go to the hassle of returning it. I than saw a small orange tab on the toner cartridge by the electrical contacts that I guess protects it during shipping. In the terrible instructions there was a small picture that showed it should be removed. When I did that &amp; reinserted the toner cartridge, it worked fine. Why would a factory tech not ask about something that is such an easy fix, but also very easy to miss for a new customer? Especially when asked, "Could I have missed something in setting up the cartridge?" I guess it's easier to just tell everyone to send it back. Hopefully I will not need them a second time!</span>

<span>Addendum 29 November 2020 (purchased in February 2020).  The first several months with this printer were serendipity, printed great, but I only needed it a couple times a month.  HP sent a spare set of ink cartridges early on as my first refill under its Instant Ink program.<br/><br/>Went to print after a couple months of non-use in October 2020, photo colors were washed out and striped, like the heads had lost all control (more on this in Addendum at bottom).  After several attempts to remedy it, printing test pages that all counted toward my Instant Ink quota, I gave up and installed the new ink cartridges, all was good again.  Now, a month after that, went to print a letter with photos, back to the same problem.<br/><br/>This printer unfortunately is no longer worth the pain and suffering to work through it.  It was great at first, but then it let me down, bigly.  My guess, someone who uses it regularly would have better results, as others reported the inkjet heads dry up if not used often.<br/><br/>And a word about the Instant Ink Program.  A reason for having this small compact printer is the ability to stow it away when not in use.  However, HP sent frequent reminders to plug it in and get it on line so it could report on the 0 pages it was printing.  I tried to do so for a day here and there to suit them, but the communications got more aggressive.  Plus...the program of free monthly quotas up to 15 pages now has a nominal charge.  And more, once I sent in the old inkjet cartridges I was hoping for HP to send replacements.  Did not happen, apparently I have to print their target threshold of pages, which isn't going to happen with bad printing issues.<br/><br/>Summing up, I had high hopes for this for my minimal use, but those hopes were for naught.<br/><br/>If you are a potential buyer, here's some longer term experience, but if you are a frequent user, I encourage you to read below at what I found out of the box after a couple weeks of use.  It's not all bad, just didn't work for me.<br/>-------------------<br/>My 8 year old HP OfficeJet 6700 finally gave up the fight —  would not load paper.  It was originally purchased to print from iPhones and iPads, but gave way to a mono LaserJet Pro M227fdw, which is a workhorse (if you want a reliable mid-level all-in-one).  Both excell(ed) at duplexing, which was a main requirement for my printing at the time each was purchased.  As I defaulted to the LaserJet, I used the 6700 for color printing only, which was done in spurts, probably not averaging more than 10 pages a month, plus expensive cartridge replacement.<br/><br/>Once I lost the color printer, I did an exhaustive, paralyzing search for a replacement, since the need was essentially just for simple color printing.  The DeskJet 3755 was attractive in compactness, style/color, and price, but came with so many negative comments on multiple facets and no duplexing.  Yet, no matter what I looked at in the less-than $200 variety, everything had similar faults, almost as if the same group of reviewers wrote the same reviews for every HP, Epson, Brother, and Canon printer out there.<br/><br/>I eventually decided a $50 cost was worth the risk, even with reported slow performance, scanning issues, connectivity issues, and an ink-guzzler.  I was also turned off by the reported “must provide credit card to set up” reports.  No, you don’t, I did without it.  But I later provided a credit card to join the HP Instant Ink program, which once you do the math, is a no-brainer at low volume…or actually any volume, with the flexibility to change or back out at any time.<br/><br/>After a week or so, I can report it is not slow (in general) at normal quality, and the print is crisp, even with photos embedded in documents.  Scans are crooked if you put them in loosely, as opposed to square against the right-side guide, and then the scan is as you would expect a proper scan to appear.  No, it doesn't have a flatbed to scan books, ID cards, etc.  I don’t care that you can only feed one page at at time, since I’m using my LaserJet for scanning.  If you are copying voluminous ledgers or reports, anything other than loose pages, don’t buy this all-in-one.  I have not and don’t intend to do color nor B&amp;W copying, so maybe folks are right that it’s not great on this printer, though with a little patience, it probably isn’t that bad as reported.<br/><br/>As for connectivity issues on initial setup, I was prepared for a mess, but was delighted by the simplicity, which I accomplished while on eternal hold with another company needing customer support; you could call it “distracted setup.”  Perhaps the confusion for some users comes in the variety of ways HP offers for setup…through a downloaded mobile platform app, direct cable, or internet connection to your main computer, in my case a Mac OS.  I opted for the mobile platform app.  It was not always intuitive, but with few little hiccups, it connected well.  I would offer to be sure your main computer downloads needed drivers, and once I did, I had no problems.  I didn’t realize that until I went to the downloaded app for my Mac, that drivers still needed to be loaded, which took less than 5 seconds to do.<br/><br/>For the record, those reporting they had to print 11 or more pages in setup...you pushed too many buttons that can give you status, etc, but really didn't need to be printed with setup.  With initial setup I only printed three pages, one being the print alignment tool, which was optional (it was pretty much okay without doing that).<br/><br/>I can only surmise that those reporting connection problems either had a network system that was tweaked for their purposes beyond normal configurations, leading to compatibility issues at first attempt to connect to this printer, or they possibly tried to mix steps of the options for setup if they encountered what might have seemed like non-response, in which case I discovered give it time.  There are occasional blank screens that don’t show loading/setup action, which was working in the background.  That’s one thing HP could fix.<br/><br/>What actually scared me were reviews of poorly printed text, photos, and the like.  As one or more reviewers have noted, that is likely a firmware problem. So upon initial setup I checked the firmware status and confirmed the latest was installed, likely when first connecting and registering.  And as mentioned, there are a couple tools in the app to help you fix that.  That said, there are no issues so far with print quality — text nor photos.  It is what I was expecting, and surprisingly, not much different from the good old OfficeJet 6700, Rest In Peace.<br/><br/>So I have a printer that I expect to meet my low-demand color print needs as well as ink resupply, that will hopefully be delivered without asking, just-in-time at low or no-cost.  I decided I really don’t need auto-duplexing, I can just turn the page over to print the flip side, and I love the compact size and color styling.  If it starts to let me down I will amend this review, but for now, 5-stars for a $50 unit, with pleasure!<br/><br/>Addendum October 18, 2020:  One thing another reviewer pointed out, that the inkjet heads dry out or clog up from dust over time, or a variation of that, just happened.  After 8 months of very low level use, I went to print a color photo that at first printed normally but too small, resized it, reprinted, and the colors where very much washed out, almost negative-looking.  Cartridge ink levels looked to be more than half on the HP app.  I did a couple routine troubleshooting attempts like reducing pixel count, realignment test, and the like, but no change.  I removed the inkjet cartridges, wiped the excess ink from them, and tried again, no change.  So I installed the new jets the HP program had sent upon signup and everything again worked fine.  I returned the old cartridges in the prepaid envelope from the ink program.  Hopefully HP will send replacements automatically as they did before.  But the foot-stomper here is use it more often than I have been and you should be A-OK.  Still 5-stars!</span>

<span>First off, I want to say as a printer that prints this printer does the job. If you're looking for just printing and a printer that is relatively small and compact, this is a decent option and cheapish.<br/><br/>My wife and I are planning to move abroad soon, so we were in search of a printer that would just do basic things-- for her it was mainly printing return labels for her online purchasing and misc things. What we found is that there are two no great things about this printer: the set up and the scanner.<br/><br/>In my mind the scanner should feed from the top, but it does not. It feeds from the bottom with no support, which leaves a big gap when scanning and/or the bottom section of the page to be missing entirely. This could be easily fixed by returning this and getting a better, potentially more expensive printer, but as I mentioned that would be a waste for us. There are scanning apps that work perfectly well out there for the few times we need that function.<br/><br/>As for the set up. I saw someone mention they were glad they had a PC for this set up because it made it easier, but from what we experienced, setting up the wireless printing for my wife's mac book was more easier than her PC. You simply activate the wifi on the printer, look up the wifi single on on your computer and connect. Was is super easy and intuitive? No. It actually took some fussing to get it to work but it was relatively "easy".</span>

<span>Bought this to replace an old Epson printer. Light weight. Small footprint. Installation through the HP Smart app was acceptable. Had to contact HP support for assistance.  There is very little documentation included with the unit.  Both color and black and white copy quality is good.  Wireless works very well once it is set up.  Scan quality is good with multiple options.  The scanner option is single page feed, but additional pages can be added through the app.  Both document and photo printed quality is good.  Print speed, however, is slower than it should be.  This unit is best for light personal use.  Would not recommend this unit for business use or heavy personal use. 1st set of inkjet cartridges through Instant Ink program arrived promptly.  Cost of the program and multiple options is a cost saver. This unit will serve my purposes very well. LCD panel informative and well designed.</span>

<span>So I like this printer for my uses for sure. It's simple and prints at a reasonable speed. The only gripe I have is that I have to trouble shoot why it doesn't stay connected to my laptop (Chromebook) while both are on and have internet access without interruption. I have printed something then tried to print something else immediately after that was done and it wouldn't connect until I went to reset the printer. It could just be my lack of tech abilities that is causing a random issue that's easy to resolve, I am unsure though. Otherwise, it's compact, prints at a reasonably fast pace, prints good quality stuff, and is fairly simple. I recommend this if you just need a printer to use once in a while for average quality printing. If you are printing 100+ pages a day, this is definitely not your printer or if you need to print very high quality stuff.</span>

<span>Not worth it.<br/><br/>(Not one for reviews but...) Quick overview:<br/><br/>• Hypothesis: HP Printer is only able to be “installed” on (1) device, Customers are unable to adjust wi-fi passwords/or providers, and potential un-successful client services offerings and spam risk.<br/>o HP “Customer Support” OR “Home Support” is located within various regions. Unless you are looking to spend your time on hold with the representatives who are disguised as Sales Spam Artists (potentially hacking into your computer software system), or navigating your way through the “self-service” systems, Individuals and owners alike waste over 2+ hours on “hold” only to lead to further unresolved issues and even worse data breaches of contracts and information systems.<br/>o The Websites/Apps, Directions, and Instructions provided within the company lead to dissatisfied customer experiences.<br/>o Unless you’re trying to look for a “quick fix”, it might work in the beginning but long term – the value of the worth, from my perspective, I haven’t been able to witness.<br/><br/>***If curious, notes below:<br/><br/>Previously having formerly invested in other brand name printers, I was unaware of my expectations… especially from a well-respected brand of HP.<br/><br/>After purchasing the “HP DeskJet 2755 All-in-One Printer” or  “HP DeskJet 2755e Wireless Color All-in-One Printer with Bonus 6 Months Instant Ink with HP+” on 04/22 from Amazon; was incredibly excited and pleasantly surprised with the seamless installation.<br/><br/>Once registering the device, customers are informed of the partnership with HP Instant Ink, which works closely together with HP Development Company, L.P. to schedule automated “ink” delivery. Packages are presented with various price ranges to the customer - boiling down to a per ink cartridge and anticipated number allotment of the number of pages being published by the owner, every month.<br/><br/>For the first 1-2 months, hadn’t experienced anything alarming. However, had unexpected technical challenges which shortly developed upon updating the Wi-Fi password.<br/><br/>– Out of security purposes, it is recommended in general to update passwords and login information ~ about every 90ish days. -<br/><br/>When attempting to re-connecting to the Wi-Fi, customers immediately might experience unanswered questions; “bot-chats” that provide additional links to articles within the website that do not directly answer the question originally situation; and when finally getting in touch with “HP Support” (via phone call) are then confronted with irrelevant questions - unrelated to the product malfunctions - and then are continued to be ridiculed with various recommendations of “security systems” packages. Whether this is purchased or not, they have “control” or “access” to the computer. Unfortunately, the computer was unable to be revived due to the unexpended circumstance which led to a Product Technician (of a well-named company) reviewing the computer, and communicating “I have never seen anything like this before.”<br/><br/>With the original computer being hacked and shut down, a re-installation within a brand-new year-to-date computer, the attempt was made with HP Development Company, L.P (multiple.) No surprise, but once again was unable to connect to the Wi-Fi. (Within consideration for the company and due diligence of the Wi-Fi Provider, multiple other devices were able to reconnect within a blink, and multiple attempts to re-install the HP Development Company, L.P. “HP DeskJet 2755 All-in-One Printer” or  “HP DeskJet 2755e Wireless Color All-in-One Printer with Bonus 6 Months Instant Ink with HP+”.)<br/><br/>Buying items from Amazon is much more convenient, however, there is something really to be said of this product not being able to be returned, especially with the false advertisement and guarantees.<br/><br/>From a company perspective, can’t help but be concerned about the ethics and values within the HP business. Highly would recommend considering alternative replacements for the Product, Engineering, and Human Resources departments to be able to hold the brand standards and values we have all longed for when purchasing a product, especially one so accredited as such.<br/><br/>Additionally, if the machine is unable to correspond with basic security policies and password updates - the potential buyer and customer need to be made aware of this within the original description before moving forward with payment and further “challenges”.<br/><br/>Best of luck.</span>

<span>Light weight and compact enough to not get in the way. Prints fast for me. Easy to assemble but to setup you will need to install the App on your phone or PC for it to work. If you have trouble printing right with Windows 10 it is due to MS update and there is a patch for it, the link in the app so you can install the driver. Wireless and you can print from anywhere to the printer. Also an option for HP+ and Instaink so they send you ink when you are low before you run out, you pick your plan on how many pages per month you use or change it whenever. Never run out of ink. The basic low end is only 99 cents a month!  You can choose to opt out of it. Cannot comment on durability and life because I just go it the other day. But with HP+ there is a 2 year warranty included.</span>

<span>This would likely be great IF you only use it at home on a good wifi network and with just one computer. I bought this for travel while traveling in our motorhome.  Certainly not portable but the best I could find for a reasonable cost. It set up with only minor difficulty at home and once on the home wifi network it worked just fine from multiple laptops. .  It prints beautifully. You have to load its HP Smart app to use the features.  I think I would not use the auto-ink supply option as it complicates things a lot.<br/>  On the road.. I rate it a one star for the difficulty I encountered getting it "re-setup" to change to the RV Park's network, and getting it set up to "print direct" was just as bad.  One can't be both on a remote wifi network and print direct... one or the other it seems. Not too handy for printing things you are researching online.  Instructions are not clear and the Smart App is no help either.  I finally resorted to using an old USB printer cord which I got to work, once I learned the wifi had to be shut off on the input panel.  One would think you could just shift the USB cord and have it work on another laptop (wife's).  No.... that took even longer. And.... if you cannot connect it to a wifi network, the HP Smart app will not let it print as it wants to track your ink supply if you have signed up for the free ink trial period. The cartridges that come with the printer will get you started but may not last as long as some you purchase.<br/>  I have had computers since before they had hard drives.  The early desk jets were great. This one is beyond my willingness to fool with.  Of course, it could all be due to operator error, but this operator no longer has the patience to tolerate things that are not somewhat intuitive or at least well explained in documentation one doesn't have to search out online,  including obscure PIN settings and info provided only when the printer itself prints it out.  Still looking for a simple one for travel. This is not it.</span>

<span>Fast laser printer, even if a bit older tech, but definitely not outdated yet. I'm coming from years and years of Canon inkjet printers. Ink just doesn't cut it, it's not economical, it's messy, costly and generally hard to maintain overall. If you're looking for speedy two-sided printed, scanning, decent app menu and options as well as longevity and ease of use, this Brother HLL2395DW is the way to go. About as big as my Canon Pixma I'm replacing, no worries on volume. Manual feeding tray is no show stopper for me, I'm not printing loads of paper on a daily basis. Pretty happy with this printer, connecting to WiFi was easy, there is very good website support and downloads available and this printer is compatible with two Brother apps (at least on Google Store/Android).</span>

<span>Just ordered this to replace my Brother 5150D b/w laser which I've had ever since it was first sold and it served me well.  I would have tried replacing the parts as I really liked this model but the part that was needed cost almost twice what this brand new printer cost PLUS the new printer had more updated features and allowed me to also dump my Epson workforce 600 piece of junk that always had dried out ink  cartridges and just wasn't that great overall...after replacing expensive ink cartridges over the years and having them dry out I stopped printing on it and only used it for the scanning option to get PDF output since my Brother 5150d didn't have it.  Otherwise I would have trashed this one long ago.<br/><br/>That said, this Brother model had everything we needed-WiFi, Network port, scanning and b/w laser (we don't need color anymore as it is a waste of toner).  So far, this thing is fast, was simple to set up and I can even print from our mobile devices using the iPrint Brother app not that we have a need to print from phones or tablets often but it's a cool option if needed.  I also have this printer connected to my router to serve as a "print server" and all we need to do is install a little router application utility on PCs or other endpoints to easily connect.  WiFi is fine too but I like the router connection to the printer as it always works and is faster in my opinion but this is dependent on what router you use and some might not have this option.  WiFi works fine too though so pick your poison :-)<br/><br/>You can also use NFC if your device has this option.  Supposedly, NFC works only in close proximity to the printer but my wife tried it from the other side of the house and it printed fine so NFC could just work anywhere in your house and doesn't need you close to the device per se as much as on the same network in your house. Either way it worked fine.<br/><br/>This brother printer also is a nice footprint and only takes up a small amount of space.  It can also COPY and SCAN TO APPLICATIONS like dropbox, google drive, one drive and others if you need that capability.  The SCANNER is only a FLATBED type...no ADF but the Brother application that you use for printing and scanning is nice and you can easily do multiple pages but manually.  That works for me as I don't often need the ADF (would be nice to have though) so it is something I can live without.  There's probably another model with both ADF and FAX options but I have no idea.<br/><br/>We also did not get the FAX model but I don't think we've faxed anything in years so I'm amazed they even sell this option anymore but some folks might still have the good old POTS lines at home. I'm sure that would work but not something I can test.<br/><br/>I also bought a spare High Yield toner for when this needs it as I wasn't sure if they send a full toner with the device or not.  Many used to give you a starter cartridge but this toner seems fairly full so this initial toner might last us a while but I've got the spare when needed.<br/><br/>Highly recommend Brother brand as they seem solid and built to last.  Hope this helps.</span>

<span>A great printer which easily provides enough black and white laser printing for home use. Easy to use, and simple to setup, you will be printing in seconds. I recommend only using genuine ink and drums in these units as I used aftermarket ink and drums for years, and ruined multiple brother printers and finally decided to stick with only genuine Brother ink and drum units. Great Printer at a great price!</span>
