<span>Great camera for photo journalism or amateur photographers who love taking photos. I highly recommend using manual focus tho, it really does get you the picture you want. Also recommend looking over the manual and watching a couple of youtube videos to learn the camera more. Best way to learn is to go and try it. Also, essential that the bundle comes with two lenses, adds to versatility, you won't regret it.</span>

<span>This camera is my first DSLR and it has been an incredible experience shooting in a variety of contexts and formats. I brought this camera on my trip and used the automatic presets for the majority of the trip but started learning from YouTube how to manually adjust each camera setting and realized how powerful this camera can be during photo shoots.<br/><br/>If you’re looking for long range high-depth shots, the lens that comes with this camera will be a let down. I suggest researching lenses before purchasing this camera so you can understand the full scope of costs associated with what you’re looking for as accessories can quickly up the costs. Additionally, consider purchasing a camera bag and definitely purchase an SD card.</span>

<span>Very pleasantly surprised. I needed a good quality camera on a budget and this one fits the bill perfectly! I started playing around and shooting after the battery fully charged. You will need to purchase an SD card, as one is not included. I am not a photographer, I actually bought this camera to record 4kHD videos of workouts/fitness content. After taking a few pictures, I am blown away by the quality and different settings. Manual is really awesome for fine tuning and really personalizing a shot.

<span>Overall this is an excellent camera. It feels great in the hands and the zoom and image stabilizationis phenomenal. a few problems i have is that if youre shooting professionally, or even semi professionally, do not get it. The camera does have quite a few filter features which are each individually able to be customized as well. the only reason why i am giving the camera a 4 star rating is because i am a sucker for detail, and when cropping the images you do get a decent amout of grain, even with the ISO set for 100.  When you use the function for shooting in raw,there is alot of grain and discoleration when aking light and color adjustments, furthermore, you get alot of chromatic light abberations in your shots when using the zoom feature in sunlight. other than that it is a great camera. this camera is excellent if you just want to take memorable shots on a trip or vacation and it is very versatile as far as the functions it has. it is highly customizable which ia also a plus but at the same time does take some time to get used to. One really good feature this camera has is continuous 4k burst mode, but i highly recommend getting a high speed memory card due to the fact that if you dont, the camera will stop recording 5-10 shot inso the process. The vidio quality and sound quality is excellent on this camera, and if you enjoy taking video as well as shots, this is the camera to get. also, the screen swivels 180 degrees so it makes it easy to get shots above your head, or close to the groung in a crouched position. The camera also comes with a lense hood for blocking sunlight that might cause haze or light leaks in your shots. So to summerize, proffesionally, not a great camera to have, but if you just want something versatile and quick and easy to use that takes good quality shots and video for traveling etc, this is the camera to buy. I provided some example pictures above so you can see what it is capable of.</span>

<span>For me The zoom was great !

<span>I  bought the FZ300 as a present for my wife. She loved the FZ150 she was using but found it's limitations discouraging. She didn't want my FZ200 and didn’t like the FZ1000 I bought her at first because it was too big and heavy . I ended up adding it to my camera collection (it's a great 5 star camera that I enjoy using and I highly recommend). The FZ300 is smaller and lighter than the FZ1000 and seemed like a good upgrade for her to use.<br/><br/>Before I gave my wife the camera I tested the camera out and was extremely impressed with the huge number of improvements in the camera over the FZ200. The FZ200 has the same lens and sensor as the FZ300 but the difference that the improved processor, much better EVF and touch screen, much better build quality, weather proofing make this camera a terrific buy. There are so many other features, neither of us has tried will make this camera useful for just about any occasion<br/><br/>She likes to use just the IA setting like many users and the FZ300 works just perfect in that setting. She used the camera on our just completed cruise and was so enthusiast about it's performance, I kept hearing , "I love this camera", . "I love this camera". . In viewing her images they were coming out sharp, detailed, and perfect exposure. We were both amazed that even the lower light indoors images and video showed great detail.  I set a 1600 ISO limit and images showed very good dynamic range, much better than the FZ200 I had used previously. The best features she liked were the beautiful bright sharp EVF, the fast accurate focus and the touch screen was a WOW, She also loved the many extra features. She found the handling superb. It does feel great in the hand and the new styling matches the newer Panasonic cameras. The menus are easy and the super control panel seen on expensive cameras is terrific. You can quickly adjust any setting on the LCD without going through extensive menus like most cameras. The touch focus on the LCD screen is also a great feature. Macro images are also much easier to take and look great.<br/><br/>Some really great points and extra features that make the camera very special<br/><br/>1.  The camera has an excellent grip, it  feels good in the hands. Easy to use.<br/>2.  Very good camera build, feels more solid than the excellent FZ200<br/>3.  Camera has weather sealing and can be used in inclement weather. Not waterproof!<br/>4.  Great zoom range. From 25 to 600<br/>5.  EVF is larger and improved over FZ200 and can view scenes and info better<br/>6.  Touchscreen LCD is a great improvement which allows easier use of camera<br/>7.  Can set the focus point while viewing through EVF, focus area, extra functions buttons.<br/>8.  Constant F2.8 aperture throughout the entire zoom area. Allows more light, better low light<br/>9.  Has mechanical shutter (quiet) and electronic shutter (noise free) great in museums<br/>10. Extremely fast focus, much improved over the FZ200. Depth from defocus process?<br/>11. 4K photos, 30FPS images come out 8mp, can easily select perfect photo on LCD<br/>12. 4K video now possible. Carefully done and results are excellent.<br/>13. Camera appears very fast. Fast startup and ready to use.<br/>14. Microphone port allows adding external Microphone. Useful when windy conditions.<br/>15. Improved low light images even with the small sensor. Up to 1600 with some noise<br/>16. Camera while small dSLR sized is fairly light even with the big zoom lens.<br/>17. Can easily add filters, including Polarizers, ND filters and super closeup filters<br/>18. Includes a very good lens hood that can protect the lens without adding a UV filter<br/>19. Image quality is excellent in good light, shows good dynamic range and lots of detail.<br/>20. Wifi allows easy transfer of images. And camera control through app.<br/>21. Images and video overall is excellent with lots of keepers.<br/>22. F2.8 constant aperture lens allows improved Bokeh (background blur not usually possible with small sensor.). Mostly seen in macro images.<br/>23. Good quality macro images possible.<br/><br/>What isn’t so great with this excellent camera and could be improved.<br/><br/>1. Camera uses a very small sensor, so low light images and video are limited<br/>2. Small sensor has lower dynamic range and less detail in images.<br/>3. Could use a headphone jack for video.<br/>4. Missing extra wide angle because of fixed lens.<br/>5. Not pocket able, so camera needs a bag or strap.<br/>6. Low light images and video while tops for small sensor are still limited and can be noisy.<br/>7. Lens is integrated in camera so you really can’t change the lens.<br/>8. Camera is not inexpensive but considering all the features, it’s a good buy.<br/><br/>If you love super zoom cameras or you are a birder, this is a must buy. It won't replace the FZ1000 which has a much larger 1 inch sensor with better image quality, better low light quality and better dynamic range. But the FZ300 is a true super zoom; it stands in a class all it's own and it is well worth upgrading if you have a FZ150/FZ200 or other older Canon or Nikon super zoom. Right now as of 2016, it's the best small sensor super zoom you can buy. If the camera seems too big or expensive for you,  consider the Panasonic ZS50 which is a great pocket super zoom with an EVF or the new ZS100 which now has a 1 inch sensor and touchscreen EVF..but costs more than the FZ300..</span>

<span>I've only had this camera for 2 or 3 weeks so my experience is limited, but so far I'm very happy with it.<br/><br/>I had a fairly cheap digital camera before this (GE X550), and I was looking for something that was a step up while trying to stay to $500 or $600.<br/><br/>This camera has a lot of fancy features. It has what you'd expect from any camera that's above the point-and-shoot level. You can set it to full auto exposure, manual, aperture priority, or shutter priority. Etc. The features you'd expect to find in any DSLR or mirrorless camera.<br/><br/>It has a bunch of handy features. Like a burst mode, where as long as you hold the shutter button down it will keep clicking pictures. (Choice of speed ranging from, don't quote me on the numbers, I think something like 5 shots per second up to maybe 20.) Auto-bracket mode: Click a picture and it will automatically take 2 more, one with a slightly darker exposure and one slightly lighter. (How much darker or lighter is a setting, and while I usually use 3 you can also do 5 or 7.) Image stabilization that works very well. I did some night shots hand held with shutter speeds of 1 or 2 seconds and they came out with no obvious blur. Option to have a constant brightness on the viewfinder or to have the brightness reflect what the picture will look like. One thing that you may think of as cute fluff but I think is pretty handy: You can set it so that the image shows up on the LCD panel, in the viewfinder, or you can have it use the LCD panel but then automatically switch to the viewfinder when you put your eye up to it. Or to me handiest option of all: the LCD panel folds out (I presume to protect the screen), so if the LCD panel is "open" it uses that, if it's closed it uses the viewfinder. Auto focus or manual focus. (It has a feature they claim will keep a moving object in focus, I haven't tried to use that.) Lots of other settings and options that I haven't played with much (or don't understand :-)<br/><br/>It doesn't have changeable lenses, but the built-in lens has like a 20X zoom.<br/><br/>Aperture ranges from F/2.8 to F/8.0. Shutter speeds range from open until you release the button to I think 1/4000 of a second. There's a choice between electronic and mixed electronic/mechanical shutter. If you use the electronic shutter the shutter speeds can be even faster but there are some limitations with it. (The "mixed" mode opens the shutter electronically but closes it mechanically.)<br/><br/>The camera will also take video. I've only played with this briefly, mostly I wanted a still camera, so I can't say a lot about that.<br/><br/>There are a bunch of "creative" options, like you can take pictures in sepia tones, very high contrast, soft focus, etc.<br/><br/>The menus can be accessed with buttons to scroll around or by using the touch screen. The controls you're likely to want to use all the time, setting the basic mode (S/A/M/P etc), shutter speed, focus, zoom, couple of others, are buttons or knobs. Common options are quickly reached from a few main buttons, like ISO speed, white balance, and focus mode. And there's a customizable "quick menu", so if you routinely use some feature you can set it to be reachable fairly easily without having to scroll through all the menus.<br/><br/>Drawbacks I've noticed:<br/><br/>You can't swap lenses. It's got a zoom lens that's permanently attached.<br/><br/>It's ability to give a shallow depth of field is limited. If you like to take portraits, for example, with a blurred background, you may have difficulty achieving this. I want to play with this some more.<br/><br/>I'm sure a professional photographer could point to more limitations but that's all I've really noticed so far.</span>

<span>I'm one of those photographers who while on a budget still likes to have toys to play with. This camera is one of those many toys I've purchased over the years. It was never intended to be a daily shooter for me just something I took out on occasion to take some pictures with for fun. Like, for instance, the train yard not far from my house is a fave place to go take pics. The tracks that lead to them and yard itself provide some fantastic opportunities. Lots of great shots. It actually does perform quite well and I was pleased at the quality of the resulting pictures.<br/><br/>But there is one major drawback and that's the processing time between shots. And if you're the type of person who wants to take that next shot immediately this is not your camera. I used it in sport mode the time at the yards so I'd get get between 3 and 5 shots per click of the shutter. And the downtime between shots is anywhere between 5 to 20 seconds. So you get this spot on shot of a bird sitting on the caboose and then want to get a shot of the bird closer up you'll be waiting for a few moments. Which will likely mean the opportunity is gone by the time the camera is ready again. This makes it nearly impossible to use in a setting such as sports where you have to be ready at all times.<br/><br/>That aside the pictures you get are pretty great. The zoom is fantastic (especially with a tripod) and will get you close to places that you normally can't get too. I'd say it's definitely worth the money. I'm very pleased with the purchase overall. But definitely upgrade the included memory card.</span>

And a long lens it does have!<br/>  After receiving it on the first day I charge the battery and went into the backyard to take some pictures. We Are blessed to have a beautiful pond in the backyard and a Male Mallord duck just happen to be standing out on a rock at 25 feet. Took a couple pictures of him and then zoom right into his face including his beak head and neck.

<span>I have a few cameras and I’ve been using digital cameras since the 90s. Most of them are fairly similar and user-friendly. I’ve only been using it for two months and I’ve already had a lot of problems setting it for macro and for close-up shots. If you go into the settings and start changing things you’ll notice that there is so many settings that you really don’t need or would never thing to use. I don’t want to have to take a course to use a simple digital camera. Even though I have taken a course! As with most digital products it’s all in the software. I would say this has a poor user interface and confusing directions and you can blame it all on the software. I’ve taken some very beautiful pictures with this. But I’ve also spent hours trying to figure out why it won’t focus on macro. If you just want a Camera to take nice shots I would probably steer clear of this one. Get a Nikon.</span>

<span>This is the third Kodak I've purchased in the last 10 years. The first two were Kodak Share's and were great, but no longer produced. When I say the third camera a person has to realize that I use my camera heavy duty 7 months out of the year. I'm a field appraiser and do real estate tax appraisals for three different counties every year. As I'm doing my work I take pictures of any new structures or anything that would affect value of properties. Often that can mean as many as 50 per day. They took lots of wear &amp; tear but held up really well. The first I dropped on a concrete walk. Needless to say, not the fault of the camera. The last one developed a problem in the spring lever that holds the batteries causing it not to stay closed well. I've spent the last three weeks with packing tape holding it shut! 🤣<br/>Then I decided to try the new PixPro, which I ordered through Amazon with very quick service from the dealer. It's so closely made to my others that I don't think it will take any time to master! And even better magnification! 40x where my others were only 20x. I use this feature a lot as many properties are inaccessible with a normal range.<br/>My only problem that is preventing using it right away is the camera to computer downloading. With my previous cameras I could download my pictures with the days pictures dated and numbered 1 through the end. I could delete those pictures then start over the next day with 1 . I've not figured out how to master this and am planning on calling the company for help. Right now, if I delete 12 and delete, the next day will be 13, etc.<br/>I know there are lots of $$$cameras out there but for my use, Kodak can't be beat! I'll follow up with my service form the dealer if my concerned can be addressed.</span>

<span>I bought this camera for $209 for a vacation I was planning. I think it is good to rate an object proportionately. For example, it is not realistic to expect SLR results from a $200 camera, which I was tempted to do, because of my (high) expectations.<br/>This is a wonderful camera for its price. The pictures are very clear (I am very demanding when it comes to pictures, but I want a simple camera to use for a short period), especially if you use the Automatic setting. The videos are very good. The automatic resolution is set to 1280; so, if you want a 1080 resolution, you have to change it. Over all, this a good camera and I love it.</span>

<span>Camera is gorgeous to look at.  Needs four batteries instead of two.  This will cost more to run.  Can put together easily and take some pictures.  So far it works.  Pics turn out blurry. Thanks for fast shipment.  Will be a big challenge and everyone knows me that I take too many pictures.  It is going to take months to figure this one out.  I take pictures all the time.  The manual is not inside I have to go look it up online and it has very many pages.  Should be a printed manual and put inside the box.  Why not?  Kodak do better next time!  Complicated.  This camera is very heavy and I have arthritis so I had to go by a used, cheaper Kodak old camera so I could hold it in my hand.  My other Kodaks lasted many, many years but mine broke finally.  This one is too fancy better for a professional camera not one if you want a easy camera.</span>

<span>I think most, if not all, of the negative reviews talking about issues with auto focus have been user error. This is not exactly a point and shoot camera. The main thing that's easy to overlook is that you have to hold the shutter button down halfway until the square on the screen turns green, then you push it the rest of the way down. If you don't do that, the AF doesn't work as intended. If a standard point and shoot is what you're looking for, you probably won't love this camera. But if you don't mind learning how to play with the settings a bit and recognize that its a learning process, this camera is capable of really amazing pictures. I definitely didn't want something too complicated, but I wanted more than a point and shoot, and this is a nice compromise, especially for the price. Of course I'm sure its not going to produce the quality of the more expensive DSLR cameras, but I'm not a pro, I just want decent pictures of my son that my generic Android smart phone can't produce, and this more than fits the bill. And like I said, I wasn't impressed with the point and shoot cameras in my price range, especially with a fast moving toddler in a variety of scenes. I needed something with more customizable features and this camera fits my needs exactly.</span>

<span>I bought this camera so that I could take better long-distance photos with the higher-power optical zoom, and it works just fine for that purpose.  I also wanted a camera that would work on AA batteries, since these batteries are plentiful and can be purchased almost anywhere.<br/><br/>The one time that I did go out to shoot some photos with a different camera that used a rechargeable battery pack, I think that I was able to shoot perhaps 50 images before the battery gave out, so after that, I use AA batteries only, until something better comes along.  With this camera, I was able to shoot 1014 images and videos with my first set of batteries, and being able to carry several spare sets of batteries gives one peace of mind while shooting photos.<br/><br/>This camera has several discrete modes for different situations, such as portrait modes and night-photography modes.  The night modes seem to require the use of the flash, which would not be useful at any distance beyond about 20 feet (6 meters) or so.  For night photography, I prefer using one of the other modes, then adjusting the light exposure level to adjust the brightness of the image.<br/><br/>I would advise new users to familiarize themselves with the various modes, and explore the menu options that are included with each mode.  For example, the user can manually adjust the color saturation and the light exposure of the image, but finding this feature requires the user to navigate through the menus, so by all means, do some exploring and learning before going out to shoot some photos.<br/><br/>The one issue that I have had with this camera is with the auto-focus when shooting video of moving subjects.  In video mode, the auto-focus feature has 2 modes, one of which is a continuous mode that continuously adjusts the auto-focus while shooting video.  I would recommend against using this mode, because the continuous auto-focus tends to lose its lock on the subject and causes the video image to lose focus entirely.<br/><br/>I would have preferred to see some more manual shooting options, such as the ability to manually adjust the aperture, the shutter speed, and especially manual focus, but one can use the various settings and modes in this camera to compensate, at least most of the time.</span>
