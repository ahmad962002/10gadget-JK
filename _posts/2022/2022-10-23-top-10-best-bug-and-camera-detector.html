The RD-30 Bug and Hidden Camera Detector helps you locate hidden cameras and RF transmitters using visual and signal detection methods.Detect hidden cameras that use pinhole lenses with the RD30’s super bright and focused LED array. Simply choose steady or flashing mode while looking through the red viewfinder as you sweep the room.When you see a focused flash of light it could indicate the presence of a hidden camera.The RF detector senses signals in the 20 MHz to 6 GHz range. This covers a major portion of the frequencies that most common wireless transmitters use. A sensitivity level helps sweep the area for RF transmitters.Will Detect Transmitters In the 20 MHz to 6 GHz RangeDetects Pinhole Cameras With RED LED Light Concentration10 Level Signal Strength Meter For Signal DetectionTelescopic Antenna and Signal Attenuation Switch Helps in Narrowing down Hard-To-Find Signals3" x 1.75" X 0.5” Super Small Size

<span>OK as a toy, but worthless as a device as advertised. Red light did not help to detect any camera (I placed 5 different including from cells and hidden too). Flashing red light you can probably use for your car as alert, but not for camera detection. Did not meet my expectations in detecting bugs either.  Detected for example my cell from no further then 10-15 cm. Do not waste your money.</span>

<span>This arrived quickly, and does work exactly as described and shown in the videos. It doesn't seem "cheaply" made as some describe, the material isn't much different than the casing on my Kindle Fire. The only problem I am having with it is that it does NOT stay charged. Otherwise I would have given it 5 stars. It works great if you can use it right away after charging, but if you intend to carry it with you and pull it out of your purse or pocket to use on the go, forget it. I don't know if its just mine, or all of them that have this problem. I didn't return it because I waited too long to realize this was a problem. I used it right away and found that it worked, it wasn't until I tried using it again and more frequently that I realized it wasn't holding a charge. I tried charging it several times thinking maybe it just needed recharging a couple of times to get going, but nothing changed. It only holds a charge for maybe a half an hour to an hour at best. If that's all you need it for, then I say get it, If you want tot ravel with it, use it at work, or on the go, skip this one. </span>

<li class="a-spacing-small"><span class="a-list-item a-size-base"> BEST DETECTION: Detecting devices, whether small or large, is what this hidden devices detector and scanner does best. This Spy-Hawk Pro-10G hidden camera finder and GPS detector can detect any GSM alarm, GPRS, wireless video camera (up to 5.8 GHz), listening bug, GPS tracker, Bluetooth active bugging device, and spy phone transmitter. The PRO-10G has a detection range up to 35-40 feet depending on the power of the transmitting source. </span></li>
<li class="a-spacing-small"><span class="a-list-item a-size-base"> BEST FREQUENCY: With upgraded 10 GHz frequency, the Spy-Hawk Pro-10G Bug Detector offers the widest detection range of any handheld portable bug sweeper. We have one of the highest detection ranges of any RF signal detectors in the industry, able to pick up frequencies between 10 MHz and 10 GHz. Other hidden camera detectors max out at 6 GHz and are not able to detect modern surveillance equipment. </span></li>
<li class="a-spacing-small"><span class="a-list-item a-size-base"> COVERT: Exclusive proprietary circuitry was created to keep the antenna completely concealed inside this anti spy hidden camera detector. Most other detectors require an external antenna which makes it virtually impossible to conduct a covert sweep, especially when sweeping in sensitive areas that have hidden spy cameras. No covert video camera will stay hidden from this Pro-10G camera detector. </span></li>
<li class="a-spacing-small"><span class="a-list-item a-size-base"> WHITE NOISE GENERATOR: The 40 to 50 dB range white noise generator works as a suppressor of hidden listening devices to stop unwanted eavesdropping. Become your own signal &amp; WiFi scrambler spy camera finder detective by identifying the locations of and manually putting a stop to all sorts of unwanted surveillance devices. Mini and mobile, the Pro-10G is perfect for your car/vehicle, home, or personal office! </span></li>
<li class="a-spacing-small"><span class="a-list-item a-size-base"> "INFINITY" DEVICE DETECTION: Unlike other bugging devices that have only a finite signal range, an infinity transmitter can work at an infinite distance by using a telephone line as a transmitter. By using new electronic methods, eavesdroppers can now call your cell phone without it ringing and have it answered automatically. By doing this, they turn your cell phone microphone into a listening device. Use the Pro-10G to detect and put an end to this scary and unwanted surveillance. </span></li>

<span>Had suspicions I was being tracked, so I got this to be sure. I was told to take the car to an open field, drive it around while using the device because its will activate the tracker. Sure enough, the lights went off letting me know something was around me. I turned off my phone, forgot to do that at first. Then there is a button that lets you hone in to specific locations on the car. Just like the movies, there it was, under the right back tire. Hard to see at first. Keeping this around just in case.

<span>After doing some research I ended up buying this from Amazon, which arrived super quick. Literally in a day for no extra cost. Love amazon prime! I got this because of some concerns I had with possible spy GPS trackers on my friends car. After opening it, it was already charged so I started walking around the house and it went kinda crazy near my router and cellphone when I got a call. Makes sense I suppose since this is what its supposed to find, only hidden. Tried it near the car, but nothing was happening except when I was on the phone. Called their support and spoke to Jeff who was really nice and helpful. He walked me through what I need to do and be aware of to I knew I was using it right. Basically I needed to drive the car into an open field where there was no other cell phones or wifi, otherwise it would pick up other signals. There is a homing button I had to push too which is supposed to make it easier to find the signals that are closer because it cuts out the noise of other stuff. Suffice to say, I did not find anything hidden on my friends car, or other cars that I tested it on, But It does find all kinds of signals. Very happy with the purchase.</span>
