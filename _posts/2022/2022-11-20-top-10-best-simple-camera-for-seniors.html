<blockquote><em><div class="a-row a-spacing-small review-data"><span class="a-size-base review-text review-text-content" data-hook="review-body">
<span>I have several of both the Minis and the outdoor models, and this Mini is almost identical to the outdoor and indoor models in terms of quality and features. The only real difference between them is the Mini isn't weather-proof, cannot handle the extreme temperatures of the outdoor models (-4 to 113 F), has a better mount, can be image-flipped, and runs solely on a power adapter instead of batteries.<br/><br/>* Not Weather-proof: DO NOT use this mini camera outdoors or in an uninsulated building. It is not water-proof and will likely be damaged by humidity and high or low temperatures.<br/><br/>* Mount &amp; Image Flipping: this mount is great and allows easier installation locations than the indoor and outdoor cameras, because it's mounted from the bottom/top instead of the back.  Since this Mini can be mounted from the bottom or top, this means it can be turned at many more angles on all 3 axes than the Indoor/Outdoor. If you have to mount it upside-down, such as from a ceiling, the app simply allows you to flip the image vertically. The problem with the indoor/outdoor models is the mounting is on the back, which means you can't "hang" it from a ceiling and point it in any direction. Instead, if you want to mount the Indoor/Outdoor on a ceiling or near the ceiling, you have a very small angle to point it. This makes the Indoor/Outdoor cameras inconvenient to install from above in most situations because you'll end up having to point the camera directly outward from your mounting surface. If from a ceiling, it'll face down. If from the top of a wall, it'll face outward along the ceiling. The Mini's mount is much better.<br/><br/>CONS:<br/><br/>* The "Talk" feature is totally useless. Regardless of bandwidth or proximity to the router or a sync module (purchased separately), the Talk feature produces broken sound that is impossible to understand. Plus there's a long delay of 3-6 seconds, making this feature useless for conversations, even if the other person understood anything you were saying. Over several tests with all of our different Blink cameras, none of them produce clear enough speech that someone can understand you, no matter where the cameras are located.<br/><br/>* No wired Ethernet option. This camera can only be used with a wireless router and Internet connection. There are no other options.<br/><br/>* Cannot be used as a USB web cam<br/><br/>* Cannot be used for continuous live feeds. The live feed only allows up to 30 seconds of viewing, and you must hit a Continue button every 30 seconds to keep it going. So if need a camera to leave running for frequent live video, Blink isn't what you're looking for.<br/><br/>* Cloud Storage Subscription semi-requirement: the Blink Home Monitor App's features become limited if you don't purchase a cloud storage subscription. If you stick with the Sync Module for local storage and do not purchase any of the cloud storage plans, VIDEO CLIPS CANNOT BE VIEWED THROUGH THE APP. The app will only allow you to view the live feed, adjust camera settings, and use the Talk feature. Without a cloud storage subscription, the only way to view your camera's video clips is by physically taking your USB storage device (purchased separately) out of the Sync Module (purchased separately) and placed in a USB port on a computer (purchased separately).<br/><br/>To be very clear here, if you do not purchase a cloud storage subscription, you will not be able to view any of the stored video clips (including motion-activated clips) from your phone. Period. This point has not been made clearly anywhere in the advertisements, support screens, Amazon product pages, or Blink Web site, but it's a crucial piece of information that the company is being very ambiguous about.<br/><br/>To repeat, IF YOU DON'T PURCHASE A CLOUD STORAGE SUBSCRIPTION, YOU CANNOT VIEW YOUR VIDEO CLIPS THROUGH YOUR PHONE. I have seen some reviewers assert that this isn't technically possible, but as a software engineer I know this isn't true. The Blink developers clearly focused on developing the cloud storage and subscriptions, using the mobile app as the user's "portal" app to access and view the cloud-stored video clips, and have simply decided not to develop a mechanism for the mobile app to access the video clips stored in your Sync Module. I want to be very clear here....this IS POSSIBLE and would require a lot of development to accomplish, but Blink just doesn't provide this functionality (yet). Whether they are working on this feature and plan to add it in the future is unknown. But the lack of direct integration between the mobile app and the Sync Module's local storage (over the local network, especially) is a significant shortcoming in the entire Blink system. This also means that if your camera loses its internet connection, it will not capture video, you can't view the live feed, the Talk feature won't work, and you can't change the camera's settings.. The Blink system simply does not allow the mobile app to connect directly to a camera or Sync Module on your local network. It is designed to use the Internet only. This is a very important point that customers must understand. Both the camera and the Sync Module require an active Internet connection to function. They will not work independently or with just a wifi router. Internet is required.</span>

<span>UPDATED: When I saw these smaller cameras announced I was excited and looked forward to adding them to my existing 5 camera Blink system. I figured these would be a great replacement for the XT/XT2 cameras that I had inside my house so I could then re-purpose those for additional outdoor locations. I thought this was a brilliant addition to the Blink camera ecosystem, adding a lower cost camera for indoor applications like mine where the benefits of the battery power and weather-proofness would be overkill. Soon as they were released I ordered up a two-pack to add to my system. I installed one of the them and found that the picture quality right out of the box wasn’t the best but once you change the video quality setting to “Enhanced” it’s right up there with the XT2 quality. The motion detection is a little spotty, as they use a new digital method of detecting motion (AI compares one frame to the next to check for changes). Some very subtle movement will show up, like a shadow moving across the viewing area, but then actually walking across it won’t (sometimes). A rep I spoke with said that they are working on an update to improve the consistency of that feature, which will be available as an over-the-air update since it is a digital-based feature, which I think is pretty cool. So originally my poor review was based around the cloud storage feature on these cameras. After I purchased these cameras I looked into the cloud storage feature as all of the literature I found on them stated that a subscription would be required. Since this is different than the previous XT &amp; XT2 systems I was not pleased about this. After I posted my original review a rep from Blink reached out to clarify the cloud storage situation. So here is what I learned: If you already have an XT or XT2 system, then you can add these cameras to it without having to get a paid subscription. If you do not have a Blink system at all, and these cameras are the first ones you get, then you get a free subscription until December 31st, 2020; then you will pay $3/month per camera after that. By then though, they plan to have released a new sync module with an SD card slot so that you can locally store video clips without having to pay for a subscription at all. Personally I don’t think they intend to have too many people on the subscription plan, I think they see the SD card functionality being more of a selling point but they had to piggy-back the first adopters of these Mini cameras onto the cloud storage until the new sync module gets released. Maybe they had delays in getting the new sync module released at the same time as the Mini due to factory closings around the world right now. I am much happier after this getting cleared up, but hope that they update the cloud storage &amp; subscription info on the product pages to make it much clearer how this all works. Had I looked at all of the available info before buying these, then I probably would not have purchased them based on the unclear info that’s out there. In the end, the savior of the situation was the rep that contacted me from Blink. He clarified all of my concerns, gave me a great amount of info on the product, and answered all of my questions (I had lot of them). To be clear, the rep did not once ask me to change my review, take it down, or in any way artificially influence me to do any of those things. The great job he did led to me to change this of my own accord, as they really took care of my concerns. One star deducted for the confusion but three added back in for the great CS experience. Good product can get you a buyer, but good service gets you a customer for life. Blink has done a fantastic job turning a disappointed (and misinformed) buyer into a satisfied customer. So to recap, if you have an existing Blink system, buy these and use ‘em where you don’t need the wireless ones. If you are looking to get these as your first Blink setup, get them knowing you will have the option of paying for a subscription starting in 2021 or a one-time purchase of a sync module with SD card slot to store your video clips.</span>

<span>My review is for the customer service. Yes- the cameras are a great deal and quality for the price. I have indoor cameras, but I have them facing out towards the outdoors. A few weeks ago, there was a murder. Trying to help the police, I knew my cameras caught it all so I went to review and could not log onto my account. I realized that my old phone was connected, not my new phone number. Long story short, it was a mess to get my number updated. Having said that, the Blink team members Dane and Dominic came through for me and are heros. They got me logged in, I was then able to locate the sickening event, all of it. I sent the evidence to the police this evening and will have to play the waiting game to see if there’s anything else I can do. What happens was truly tragic, but the images were clear, the night vision was crisp and the cameras detected every move. Please extend my gratitude to these two team members.</span>

<span>I bought this to use as a baby monitor, thinking if the quality was good I would end up purchasing an outdoor set as well. I got it in this afternoon, and set up was super easy. The picture quality is excellent for the price point.<br/><br/>The main issue for me is that there is no option for continuous viewing. The live view from the app will automatically shut off after 30 seconds if you don't tap the "continue?" prompt. If I had known this ahead of time, I would have never purchased a Blink camera. I watch my daughter on a Fire tablet while I work at night, and it's really not feasible to stop typing every 30 seconds to press a button.<br/><br/>Maybe it's my fault for not realizing it, but I don't remember reading any information about the length of viewing time, so I assumed it would be like the Foscam I had sought to replace. If Blink ever adds an update for continuous viewing, I would repurchase in a heartbeat, but for now, I'm sending it back.</span>

I got a crisp and clear video, posted to the Ring app, other neighbors checked their video and found the same man on their property, the police were involved immediately and the perp was taken back to jail.<br/><br/>From the press release of our local PD:<br/><br/>"On 5/11/20, [city] Police Department Patrol responded to a residential burglary that occurred the night before. The victim had left their garage door open and went for a walk around the neighborhood. During that time, from about 8 pm to 8:30 pm, an unknown subject later identified as [nam,e] entered the garage, rummaged through the cars and stole the victim’s mountain bike. While [name] was in the garage, the victim’s family was at home in the house.<br/>...<br/>When the victim realized his bike had been stolen, he checked his Ring Camera video and saw that the suspect had been inside his garage. He posted the video onto the Ring Camera Neighborhood App, warning others in the area.<br/>Many community members had seen the video of the suspect and had been in contact with the [city] Police Street Crimes Unit (SCU). SCU and PROS (Post Release Offender Supervision) Detectives along with Patrol officers began looking for the suspect.<br/>...<br/>This was an excellent example of the community working together to put a criminal back into jail.<br/>...<br/>A review of the [city] Superior Court website shows that [name] has prior convictions for stealing a vehicle, robbery, using pepper spray to commit a violent felony, being under the influence of a controlled substance, possession of drug paraphernalia, and possession of narcotics. [name] is currently on PROS/AB109 and was in custody and had recently been released from jail on May 8th by Probation due to Covid-19 concerns."<br/><br/>For a $60 camera, this was a great investment.<br/><br/>Original Review<br/>----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>I had 5 of the Amazon Cloud Cams, purchased about 18 months ago.  Amazon then acquired Ring and Blink, and discontinued the Cloud Cams, although they still provide support (for now).<br/><br/>I needed two new cameras, so I went with the Ring.  Primarily because I heard nothing negative about the security, as opposed to Wyze.  However, Ring has some real downsides relative to the Amazon Cloud Cams.<br/><br/>1. More latency.<br/>I have great WiFi.  I have multiple wi-fi mesh routers throughout the house with no dead spots.  Still have to wait ~5-7 seconds to connect to live view.  Cloud Cams was 3-5 seconds.<br/>2. No zoom<br/>I could tap and zoom on Cloud Cams.  Can't do that with Ring.<br/>3. No live view via Web Browser.<br/>Apparently you can download an app on Windows 10, but I'm on a Mac and wonder why I can't view the video in a browser.  I could go with Cloud Cams.<br/>4. I can't see multiple Cameras at once.<br/>With Cloud Cam, I could stream audio and video from all five cameras at once over the web.  It was great. Having to switch between cameras, one at a time, and having to wait 5-7 seconds per camera, is a big downside.<br/><br/>I get that Amazon needed to simplify its product portfolio after their two most recent acquisitions in this space, but it's a shame the Cloud Cam isn't sold anymore.  It was a superior product offering in this space.<br/><br/>Design, Packaging, Ease of Setup, and from what I can understand, Security is all excellent in Ring, and I have no complaints.  The app, in spite of the one camera at a time limitation, is well-designed too.<br/><br/>*** UPDATED 3-Jan-2020 ***<br/>I found the Rapid Ring app.  It works in conjunction with the regular Ring app.  Rapid Ring has limited functionality, but it does everything I need.  Somehow, it manages to reduce latency to connect to the cameras.  When I pull up the Rapid Ring app, I can connect to anyone of my cameras in &lt;1 second.  The app will also continuously reconnect to the camera after the 5 minute timeout period, so I can stream a camera indefinitely.  I have upgraded my review to 4 stars.  If Ring ever develops a generic web interface to view all cameras simultaneously, I will give 5 stars.</span>

<span>I had an incident several months ago that prompted me to add an additional camera facing my driveway. I already have a Ring doorbell. I chose this model because i can face it outside from a window and still get good coverage without the possibility of someone trying to remove it or the elements shortening the life. Set up was a breeze. It took me all of 7 minutes to add it to my app after I plugged it in. Thinking about getting one more facing my back yard. Picture quality is grainy when you maximize the image.</span>

<span>I own 5 Ring indoor cams, along with a Ring Elite doorbell and a stick up elite POE cam.  This is just my input regarding these cams as I have been testing them and using them for quite sometime.  First thing is not every indoor cam works the same, some arrive with older firmware and need updating.  Plug in close to your router and do the full set up and do your updates.  Once you add the cam to the app and it’s working well, unplug it and move it to the area you want to monitor.  Do your set up either by mounting it or setting it on a shelf.  Get the angle of view your looking for and then set up your motion zone and sensitivity.  Make sure you check the “health” box to see your signal sensitivity.  If you are using a mesh router network, you should reconnect to the closest link for it, if not you may have to reconfigure to the nearest of it isn’t automatic.  Make sure you turn on the snapshot option as well.  If you don’t want to have the indoor cams record or send alerts while your home, you can turn that ability on and off with the new quick access buttons in the app.  You will get 30 days of free recording for ALL your cams, with each cam you buy. So if you decide to buy one a month, till you cover all your angles in the home, you will literally get an additional 30 days for every cam on your network covering the 50 days of cloud storage for free.  Why not use this option while it’s still available.  After you cover your needs, opt for the yearly service.  I have 5 indoors cams, covering almost 4000 sf.  I love that I can drop in and watch over the home as well as hear and talk through the cams.  Night vision in a room is great too. Makes a great baby cam as well.  I have had 2 indoor cams give me problems in the past, either dropping off my network, or the snapshot option not working.  If you have read my ring reviews before, I am well versed in networking and I have found that some ring reps want to always point the finger at every else but their devices.  I can say I have found problems in a couple of their devices and once they were replaced, the problem was solved.  Don’t allow them to drive you insane, the community forums are good but they only can go so far for help as well.  Sometimes a quick swap of the unit with a new one solves the problem.  Amazon has always backed me and they are truly behind their customers.<br/><br/>4/2020:  I wanted to be able to watch the main entrance and hallway in my home, have an eye level view, no wires at all showing, and nothing that stood out of place.  So review the attached pics, maybe this install will gravitate people who are inclined to custom installs, know there is no limit to what you can do.  Just plan out your work and never rush.  I was able to recess an indoor cam into my wall, and still provide me with all the aforementioned needs.  I used a double electrical box as it provided me the necessary room without modifying the box.  I used an indoor/outdoor ring power supply and reused the indoor cam plug on the power supply as it fits perfect and locks in.  I obtained 120v power from a nearby electrical outlet, and brought my wire into the box from behind the wall.  I mounted the ring power supply on the back of the electrical box, and prepped the box to accept the camera.  I created a clear acrylic template and was able to use that to cut out the blank wall plate.  What’s really nice is I can still unscrew the wall plate and easily remove the cam if I need to do a reset or adjustment.  This solved many issues for me and still provided an eye level video shot of persons entering the front door.  Since the ceilings are 12’ high, mounting the cam at the ceiling with a downward angle wasn’t conducive in getting a good facial shot.  This is just one example of several I have designed myself to combat issues most of us have dealing with wires, angles, placement, etc.<br/><br/>11.21.20:  After almost a year of Ring use, I have to say I am disappointed in the Ring community forum, their tech support, and products.  Just recently, I had two of the ID cams drop offline.  No matter what I did, no luck getting them back to work.  I actually unplugged a back up ID can and went to move it, that one also dropped offline and never came back up.  Tech support was of no help, and the community forum mod just tells you to call in.<br/><br/>I would think using 10 ring cameras, I know a little about them.  Based on my research, they connect to WiFi, but can’t get to the internet.  It appears that there is a high probability that my ISP is blocking the camera for possible threats, even though I turned off my firewall, set up a DMZ zone, and just about created a WiFi bridge to push the Ring cameras too, they still won’t work.  They don’t play nice since the last firmware update.  So as they fail, I am replacing them with another company.  Honestly, I don’t care what brand I use, as long as it works.  Read the community forums, and see for yourself.  Setting up cameras is not really that difficult, troubleshooting isn’t either as long as you have full control of all devices.  Ring doesn’t allow for device control outside of normal settings.  Also, Ring devices CAN NOT, be wiped clear of stored memory setting for your home network.  It’s embedded in the device.  Even if you remove it from your home network, and sell it.  It still has your network mirrored in its memory.  Found this by pure chance.  At the very lease you should have the cams IP address to clear out stored info and reset it.  Wow</span>

<div class="slideshow-container">
<blockquote><em><div class="a-row a-spacing-small review-data"><span class="a-size-base review-text review-text-content" data-hook="review-body">
<span>So far, we could not be happier about these cameras. We bought a 5 pack and then added more. They are easy to use and work either using your phone app or the Amazon Echo. I can't imagine that the batteries will last two years at the rate we are using the cameras, but the batteries are easy to access. I think on the ones I mounted on the roof eaves, I will eventually get a solar panel to run them so I don't have to worry about changing the batteries.<br/><br/>What I like best is that you do not need wires. I have a small 1000 sq/ft house and the single unit will reach cameras from the front yard to the back yard.  We keep two cameras as portable. We put them down next to our cat when she was sick to keep an eye on her.  For a while I put one outside at the backdoor enough to see that we have regular visits from raccoons.  One on the front porch so I can see if we get deliveries.<br/><br/>The motion sensor mostly works well if you position it correctly to catch motion going across the field of view.  Haven't set up the latest set, but I'm going to put one in the garage looking at the door lock positions. I can never remember if I locked the garage and it's a pain to go out in the rain at night, just to find out it was already locked. One of these would be perfect to just look at the lock positions. Our friends that also bought them, love them.</span>

<span>I do not know where should I start. First, I have never ever seen a security or surveillance camera which does not have date/time on the recorded/live video. This camera has neither. This is why is not not referred to as a security camera by Blink. They just call it an outdoor camera. This is why it is also so low priced.<br/><br/>Local storage: Since the Blink Sync module is included with this camera, I only needed a good quality USB flash drive for local storage. The recorded video at highest quality is max 4-12MB in size, so even a 8GB flash drive would record for months. The caveat with local storage is that the camera will record ONLY when armed AND movement is detected. That's it. It will not record anything else. This is mentioned clearly in the Blink cloud storage plans. With cloud storage, it can do live recording but only on demand.<br/><br/>Movement sensing: Horrible. Absolutely horrible. The camera setup describes that the camera should NOT be pointed to any moving objects like streets, trees, plants and shrubs, areas with lot of movement etc. Where does that leave us? I mounted it to watch over the car parked on the driveway. Then I masked off the street and trees and everything else. But, the driveway gets lots of sunlight. So, shadows cast by moving cars cause false notification so any times. I tried to reduce sensitivity to 3 but then, randomly, the camera would ignore movement when my wife's car pulls on the driveway. It is a Honda Accord, so not small in size. Now I have to live with so many false notifications. Even in the night, if a car's light shine on my parked car, the camera causes false notification. If any slightest movement is detected, for example, by a shrub swaying in wind, the camera will detect motion and send notification. If running the camera on battery, these false alerts will cause battery to deplete quickly.<br/><br/>A word about zones: The motion detection zones are only rectangular. With Advanced setting, the rectangle size only gets smaller but they are still rectangular, so either I have to mask off everything in the entire rectangle or leave it unmasked. So, if a rectangle covers some part of my car and some part of the street, I have to mask off the car because otherwise the movement on the street triggers a false alarm. Compared to Ring camera, where I can define non-rectangular zones, this is a huge negative. Now, most of my car's rear is masked off to prevent false alerts from the cars on the street. Even if the rectangle covers 99% of car but only 1% of street, it will trigger false alert even on sensitivity set to 3. Major problem.<br/><br/>Recording: The recording starts after camera senses a movement, so there is no pre-movement recording. I have cameras which record 5-10 seconds of pre-movement video so when watching the recording, I can clearly see what triggered the camera. With Blink camera, since recording starts after it detects movement, only first one second of video has the event which triggered the camera. If it is a quickly passing object, almost impossible to figure out what happened. You have to have really sharp eyes to catch that.<br/><br/>Recorded Files: Since there is no date/time stamp on the videos, the only way to see the date/time of recording is by downloading the recorded files. The file name contains the date/time. However, if the USB flash drive is removed and connected to a computer, these files do not have date/time and their creation date is in UTC time. Unless someone carries a UTC to local time converter in their heads, impossible to know the date/time of recording. Absolutely horrible design. The recorded files can be deleted one at a time from the Blink app. This is extremely slow and frustrating process. I tried to remove the USB flash drive and delete the recorded files by connecting it to a laptop, but ran into the issue of UTC timestamp instead of local time.<br/><br/>Speed: This camera is slow, slow, slow. I am guessing that the live video viewing and accessing recorded files passes via Blink cloud, it takes long time to see the live video or access the recordings. After viewing maybe 30 seconds of live video, the app asks me to press the continue button to keep watching. This is a major annoyance.<br/><br/>Live video: The camera does not automatically show live video when the app is launched. It shows a static picture of the monitored area which I took when setting up the camera. So, if the camera is later moved (say it moves during battery change, it will definitely move during battery change and there is no way to position it exactly the same), it would be a good idea to take a new picture and readjust the motion zones. Another major annoyance. So, I purchased a power adapter. Now the camera is powered from the USB and does not require battery change.<br/><br/>Battery operation: There are some settings which Blink recommends for optimal battery life. If left on those settings, the videos recoded with IR on would be so poor quality that you won't be able identify any person. They are grainy and pixelated. Good idea to power it by USB power if possible.<br/><br/>Mounting: Again, plain horrible. It takes a ton of strength to push the camera into the mount but it gets knocked out very easily. When doing setting, if I moved the camera beyond the mount's limit, it would just pop-out and fall off. Then I would have to push it again into the mount and restart the process. Same thing will happen  when the camera needs a battery change. Entire setup and motion zones would need to be setup again.<br/><br/>I only got this camera because it is inconspicuous when mounted on the front. Other cameras are bulky and have a snout protruding out. We do not have much crime in the area, only sporadic, petty car break-ins have been reported in the recent months, so I am keeping this camera. Otherwise, I would have gone in for a more robust, real security camera.</span>

<span>I must preface this review by telling all that I am a mechanical klutz but semi-tech savvy.  I should also advise that I only received and assembled this product a few hours ago so I will certainly learn more as time passes and I will amend this review accordingly.  Having said that, there are a few things that I should mention for the benefit of all other klutz's out there.  The first thing I noticed is that there are no detailed instructions!  Everyone noted in Amazon revewes how easy installation was so I wasn't all that concerned when placing my order.  I should have been.  Inexcusable that there were no instructions.  I resorted to going to You Tube and found a couple of videos that were very helpful.  But even with the videos, I had some very simple but troubling issues.  I am after all a klutz.<br/><br/>The first step in installation is to download the Blink app.  Much to my surprise, the free Blink app is not compatible with a desktop PC Windows computer.  It is primarily an Android app so I was compelled to download the app to my Android phone.  Now I realize that most would not have an issue doing that but I wish I had known that because I prefer to control my surveillance systems on my PC.  I suspect there may be 3rd party companies that offer Blink compatible software for PC's but again, I wish I had known beforehand.  I am still investigating and will likely find a solution to use the app on my PC but for now, can only use compatible devices.<br/><br/>The cameras and the module are all wrapped in a thin and almost invisible plastic wrap.  One of the first steps is to install the provided 2 Lithium AA batteries in the rear of each of the cameras.  I finally figured out how to get the back plate/cover off the camera and it was a little frustrating.  First, you should know that there is a rubber plug that covers the screw which holds the back plate.  You need to take that plug out to access the screw.  The kit provided a plastic key that fits into the screw and can be used to unscrew the screw.  Simple right?  Well, I turned and turned and turned the screw but the back plate would not come off.  I finally figured out that there was a very thin and invisible plastic that wrapped around the edges of the camera body and that it had to be removed because it otherwise prevented the back plate from releasing once it was unscrewed.  Yes, you have to have had eagle eyes to have seen that plastic film and it was a little tricky getting it off.  (I warned you that I was a klutz.)  Ok, so now that I removed the plastic, I found a notch in the back plate to help lift it out of the camera body.  That now revealed the slots where to install the batteries and the slots were adequately marked to show polarity positions.  But after you install the batteries - do not screw the cover back on.  Why?  Because you need to access the camera ID serial numbers.  Again, I had to find this out on my own because there were no instructions! Also know that once you do screw the back plate back on, it should be orientated properly and there is only one way that will happen even though the cover will go on any way.  The easiest way to orient the plate correctly is to ensure that the USB C port opening lines up with the USB C port on the camera.<br/><br/>Synching the module and each of the cameras was relatively easy so I won't belabor these steps.  The You Tube videos were very helpful to get through these steps.  But here's another setup klutz problem I came across.  To mount the cameras, there are mounting bases that attach to the back of the camera body by snapping into that area where the screw is located.  Sounds easy enough but it is a little tricky.  First, understand that the mounts need to be screwed into whatever house structure your attaching the camera to.  But the holes in the mount are situated in such a manner that it is impossible to access the holes once the camera is attached.  So you need to first screw the mount on to the wall before attaching the camera.  The only problem with that is you now have to snap the camera on to the mount and as I mentioned above, that was a little difficult.<br/><br/>OK, now that I had the cameras set up, figuring out how to work the system was another stumbling block.  Again - no guidance because no instructions.  Even being a little tech savvy, I had some difficulty. I found that the software was not as user friendly as I would have expected.  OK, I am still playing with the system and learning but once again, it sure would help having instructions.</span>

<span class="cr-original-review-content">Empecemos por decir que lo que ofrece el producto es lo que vas a obtener ni mas ni menos.<br/><br/>El producto es totalmente inalámbrico , lo que le da ventajas a la hora de una instalación limpia rápida y sin cables a simple vista.<br/><br/>La conexión vía remota desde el celular a través de app es genial y muy fluida, cuando quieres ver los videos, aunque la conexión con mi dispositivo echo show 5 a sido casi imposible para el control de voz y para la visión en vivo tiene un delay bastante desagradable.<br/><br/>La duración de las baterías es excelente tengo 5 camaras instaladas y una de ellas esta en la entrada del conjunto residencial, lo que hace que diariamente este por las 70 notificaciones de movimiento promedio con sus respectivos videos y aun después de un mes dice que esta sobre el 70% de vida.<br/><br/>Las notificaciones son casi que en tiempo real max unos 10 a 15 seg después de la detección de movimiento llega la notificación a la app de celular, pero la conexión con alexa en mi caso a sido terrible y bastante deprimente porque me decidí por el producto justo por esa función y no he podido darle solución a los errores constantes entre alexa y el skill de blink.<br/><br/>Ahora indaguemos mas en lo tecnico y por lo cual me ha decepcionado un poco el sistema.<br/><br/>Este no es un sistema de vigilancia de video es mas en mi opinión un sistema de alarma de movimiento con capacidad de grabar el evento que activo la señal de alarma, aunque muchas veces ese video termina por frustrarte mas y a continuación explico el porque<br/><br/>El sistema solo puede grabar entre 5 seg y 60 seg de grabación y aunque a veces 60seg es mucho tiempo, tiene una opción que permite parar el video antes si el movimiento se detiene, pero aca es donde comienza el problema en realidad, si activas esta opción, el sistema tiene una contra que la camara al desactivarse tarda 10 seg en volver a estar lista para registrar otra alerta lo cual hace que a veces pierdas información valiosa en cuanto a seguridad, si el movimiento para y luego se reactiva mientras la camara esta en el reposo de los 10seg, la camara no registrara nada en video y si el intruso sale fuera del rango de detección ya no podrás saber que paso luego, incluso si el movimiento llegar a seguir después de los 60seg max de grabación por alerta, la camara entraría en ese mismo tiempo de descanso de 10seg.<br/><br/>Aunque las alertas en la app son muy rápidas este Tiempo se puede ver afectado si la opción  de alertas rápidas no esta activada, ya que esta viene desactivada por defecto y si no se activa en cada camara puedes tener unas que te avisen y otras que las notificaciones llegue siempre tarde o después que ya se detecto el movimiento.<br/><br/>En resumen si lo que quieres es un sistema de alerta de movimiento o cercanía este es el sistema que debería comprar pero si quieres un sistema de vigilancia de video busca otras opciones.<br/><br/>Dentro de amazon hay varias opciones de camara ptz wifi con grabación continua, detección de movimiento, alarma sonora y audio doble vía que trabaja muy similar a este sistema y con una memoria de 32gb tienes hasta 4 dias de grabación continua y son mas económicos, aunque no son tan excelentes como este en visión de video en vivo o revisando archivos de alarma te serán mas útiles si lo que buscas es un sistema cctv, por lo menos en mi opinión.<br/><br/>Postdata aun no se como funciona el sistema sin la membresía a Blink plus aun estoy dentro de la  prueba gratis y aunque ya tengo todo el sistema para grabación local pronto volveré con mi opinión de como se porta el sistema una ves no tengas el soporte de Blink Plus.<br/><br/>--------------------------------------------------------<br/><br/>Let's start by saying that what the product offers is what you are going to get, no more, no less.<br/><br/>The product is completely wireless, giving you the advantage of a quick clean installation without wires at a glance.<br/><br/>The remote connection from the cell phone through the app is great and very fluid, when you want to watch the videos, although the connection with my echo show 5 device has been almost impossible for voice control and for live viewing it has a delay quite unpleasant.<br/><br/>The duration of the batteries is excellent, I have 5 cameras installed and one of them is at the entrance of the residential complex, which means that every day there are 70 average movement notifications with their respective videos and even after a month it says that it is over 70% life batteries.<br/><br/>Notifications are almost in real time, max about 10 to 15 seconds after motion detection, the notification arrives on the mobile app, but the connection with alexa in my case has been terrible and quite depressing because I decided on the right product for that function and I have not been able to solve the constant errors between alexa and the blink skill.<br/><br/>Now let's dig deeper into the technical and for which the system has disappointed me a bit.<br/><br/>This is not a video surveillance system, it is more in my opinion a motion alarm system with the ability to record the event that activated the alarm signal, although many times that video ends up frustrating you more and I will explain why below.<br/><br/>The system can only record between 5sec and 60sec of recording and although sometimes 60sec is a long time, it has an option that allows you to stop the video earlier if the movement stops, but this is where the problem really starts, if you activate this option, the system has a counter that when the camera is deactivated, it takes 10 seconds to be ready again to record another alert, which sometimes means that you lose valuable information regarding security, if the movement stops and then reactivates while the camera is At rest for 10 seconds, the camera will not record anything on video and if the intruder goes out of the detection range, you will no longer be able to know what happened next, even if the movement continues after the maximum 60 seconds of recording by alert, the camera would enter that same rest time of 10sec.<br/><br/>Although the alerts in the app are very fast, this Time can be affected if the quick alerts option is not activated, since it is deactivated by default and if it is not activated in each camera you can have some that notify you and others that Notifications always arrive late or after motion has already been detected.<br/><br/>No me In short, if what you want is a movement or proximity alert system, this is the system you should buy, but if you want a video surveillance system, look for other options.<br/><br/>Within amazon there are several wifi ptz camera options with continuous recording, motion detection, sound alarm and two-way audio and lights that works very similar to this system and with a 32gb memory you have up to 4 days of continuous recording and they are cheaper, although They are not as excellent as this one in viewing live video or reviewing alarm files.  They will be more useful if you are looking for a cctv system, at least in my opinion. Postscript I still don't know how the system works without Blink plus membership I'm still in the free trial and although I already have the entire system for local recording I'll soon come back with my opinion on how the system behaves once you don't have Blink support Plus.</span><span class="cr-translated-review-content aok-hidden"></span>

<span>We purchased this camera for work purposes and have to say, it does do the job. I was able to zoom a pretty good distance (more than what is actually needed). The flash is not the best BUT after walking the property and taking random photos - the camera did pick-up lowlight areas and did brighten the scene, so the photo did come out clear and brighter. I wouldn't recommend this camera for a person who is experienced and is used to a more sophisticated DSLR camera as it would be a disappointment to you. This is great for someone wanting to learn how to take photos and doesn't want to carry multiple lenses around at the same time. Although these cameras were purchased for work, I did catch some pretty nice shots. The main caveat I will say is the LINK123, APP. Unfortunately, the app does not always function when you want it to. Also, it would be nice to be able to open the app without syncing your camera to view older saved photos in your camera gallery.<br/><br/>Overall, if you would like an introductory camera with pretty neat options - I would recommend this camera.</span>

<span>I bought this camera for $209 for a vacation I was planning. I think it is good to rate an object proportionately. For example, it is not realistic to expect SLR results from a $200 camera, which I was tempted to do, because of my (high) expectations.<br/>This is a wonderful camera for its price. The pictures are very clear (I am very demanding when it comes to pictures, but I want a simple camera to use for a short period), especially if you use the Automatic setting. The videos are very good. The automatic resolution is set to 1280; so, if you want a 1080 resolution, you have to change it. Over all, this a good camera and I love it.</span>

<blockquote><em><div class="a-row a-spacing-small review-data"><span class="a-size-base review-text review-text-content" data-hook="review-body">
<span>I recently adopted a one-year old dog through a local rescue agency, and, very dishearteningly, I soon learned that the situation from which my dog had been pulled was an extremely abusive one, where most of the dogs were left to fend for themselves or kept in groups in cardboard boxes. At only five pounds, Lily, my new (and most wonderful) friend, has had a great deal of anxiety as a consequence of these early-life experiences. When I leave my house to run errands on which she cannot accompany me, I crate her, and I have been (out of my own dog-guardian anxiety!) worried about how she handles my absence during those periods. A colleague of mine suggested Wansview, and she could not have been more correct.<br/><br/>Reviews of the application through which the Wansview camera works (I will discuss set-up momentarily) paint a curiously negative picture, some saying that recent changes in the application have made it difficult to sustain a connection with the camera. I downloaded the application, as the instructions requested, and I began the setup process. I thought I had done it properly and was thus surprised when the camera could not seem to establish an audiovisual connection between its recording lens and my cellphone. Here, two points must be noted, both of which will hopefully gesture toward the quality of the product and the excellent customer service Wansview offers.<br/><br/>First, the error on my part--the instructions say clearly that a new user must wait to hear certain phrases emitted by the camera's microphone to confirm that it is completely operational. Due to hasty reading on my part, I did not notice the final phrase for which one was supposed to wait, the content of which offered confirmation of a secure, steady Internet signal. Within about ten minutes of the camera having been installed, I received a notification to update my firmware to the latest version (this notification was not the consequence of any complaint I had registered; it was simply the application informing me that new firmware was available). I downloaded the firmware, and the feed began to work. Since then, I have never had a problem with accessing the feed, and I am able to check in on Lily while I am running errands. Never having owned a dog, I have had my fair share of first-dog anxiety, and I am now able to determine how long after my departure Lily whines (steadily decreasing and now only lasting a few minutes) and check in on her while she is in her crate to ensure that she is sleeping and safe. The relief of that knowledge alone makes the product worthwhile. The quality of the feed is also excellent, so much so that I play it in its SD variety (I haven't needed to go the HD route because everything is already clear as crystal). The application is incredibly easy to use, and since the successful installation I have not had to do anything.<br/><br/>Now, for the second point. Between my initial installation of the application and the ten to fifteen minutes it took for the firmwarm to update and for the camera to start working (during that time I could not maintain or open a connection between the camera's feed and my cellphone), I sent an e-mail to Wansview's customer service department. One of their agents, Melody, responded within 24 hours. Not only did she provide me with instructions on how to begin to assess what the potential issue might be and how she could help me address that, she explained that Wansview so stands by its products that if my camera proved defective I could return it at no charge or have it replaced. Because the camera was already working, I made a note to myself to reply to her e-mail later in the day.<br/><br/>When, due to my own error, I forgot to reply to Melody's message, confirming that the camera was indeed working, she followed up me with via e-mail to confirm that I had received her message and to ask what she could do to help ensure that the camera was working. I do not know if I have ever had a customer-service experience during which a company representative reached out to me a second time because I mistakenly failed to reply to their first message. In her second message, she reiterated her commitment to helping me ensure that the product worked properly and that Wansview's ethic was one that stood behind the quality of its products and the quality of customers' experiences with those products. I immediately replied, thanked her for her message, and explained how happy I was with the quality of the product.<br/><br/>In short, even if you experience any issues with this camera during setup, it seems like Wansview takes very seriously its commitment to customer service. As someone not altogether fluent in techno-gadgetry, the abundant interest in helping to ensure that I could use the camera with use certainly marks out Wansview as unique in my experience. And, the price is a terribly affordable one. All in all, I would encourage anyone to consider buying this camera, and, if they choose to do so, to buy it with the ease of knowing that there is an active customer-service team happy to interface with you and help resolve any issues.</span>

<span>I got these cameras on sale a few weeks ago and so glad I did! I have one set up in my main living room as well as my basement living room and LOVE how clear the images are!  The app is super easy to use and I really enjoy being able to move the camera to see around the rooms.  The night vision is fantastic, almost looks like daytime with very clear images.  I have blink cameras and I like these Wansview cameras much better - better picture quality, easier to use and can continually watch without being asked to “continue watching?”  In general these cameras were easy to set up, the app is easy to use and I enjoy the quality of the images - highly recommend.</span>

<span>I'm no security camera expert so take my review as you wish lol<br/>This is the first camera I've bought for security purposes indoor. The quality of the video and sound is good. I liked how the camera could move around and the real-time kept up with the app when watching from the video feed.<br/><br/>The app itself crashed 50/50 when used. I wasn't a big fan. The layout of it was decent, so it was pretty user friendly, I just felt like it was a bit unreliable.<br/><br/>I'd say if you are looking for something to casually keep an eye on an area this is a good cheap buy but if you want something more reliable, look elsewhere.</span>

<span>Installation was simple: I followed the instructions, and it all worked at the first try. (I use android phone).  Motion detection works, I did not play with it much so far, but it is nice that one can choose the portion of the screen where it is active and adjust the sensitivity.  The most impressive feature so far is that at low light the camera automatically switches to infra red and turns on IR lamp to illuminate the room.  I also like that some of the additional features such as cloud storage, etc. for which one needs to pay separately -- are optional: if you don't want them -- you don't pay.  And most amazing is the price.  I will buy more.</span>

<span>Unfortunately, I have to return this item. I want to make this concise but comprehensive.<br/><br/>Pros:<br/>- The camera is inexpensive but not shoddily made.<br/>- The app isn't the worst I've seen and there are a lot of options to change.<br/>- The camera pans and tilts remotely, via dragging your finger on the app. It also zooms in. This is cool and useful.<br/>- For an inexpensive camera, the actual camera hardware (i.e. quality of the video) is pretty good.<br/>- Aesthetically, it is inoffensive and subtle, and fits in with today's tech (even if it's more cheaply made).<br/><br/>Cons:<br/>- The viewing angle of the shot is restrictive and close up. You have to place the item far back to get a wide angle unlike with some other cameras with better hardware. Still, for this price point, I have no complaints about the hardware of the actual camera.<br/>- Connecting the thing. This is where I just couldn't take it anymore. I was able to connect via the app when I connected the camera to ethernet. I could not get it to connect to my wireless network. It has pretty strict demands for connecting to wifi (e.g., no 5ghz network, which is common I guess) but even with those demands met, I should have been able to connect.<br/><br/>When attempting to connect, the app asks you to turn the volume up on your phone and bring it close to the camera's microphone. It states that wifi needs sound to connect. Your phone then proceeds to emit a truly horrendous repeating beeping/connecting/static sound pattern for two full minutes. I'm just sitting there with the camera right next to my router (as it says, "Close your camera to the router") and this terrible noise blasting from my phone, my dog going crazy and my patience running thin. Over and over. And I can't connect to wifi. What kind of an app makes you go through a process like that? I've never seen anything like that before.<br/><br/>Conspicuously, none of the reviews here mention that. I wonder if that's because, as another reviewer noted, they claim to offer you a free microSD card for your review. Let's find out if they give me one for my honest review of this item.<br/><br/>Ultimately, despite the camera's fairly impressive hardware (for the price), inoffensive aesthetic, and successfully functioning features such as pan/tilt remotely, motion detection, and night vision, the wifi connectivity problems and wrist-slitting process was the deal breaker for me. I wanted to like this guy, but I have to return it.</span>

<span>Nice camera. Have not had a chance to check out the night vision yet since I am not home most nights and I just finally had the time to get this set up today . The rest of this camera seems to work great. The picture is very clear and crisp. I will be taking a trip out of state soon and I hope to be able to check on my cats and my care giver that will be feeding them while I am gone. This was a very easy and quick set up. The bar code scanner, that comes with it, would not scan in my phone, no matter what, but going to the site to download the app was no big deal though. There are a lot of features in the app to use to set up a lot of different settings that you want. So far I am quite impressed with this camera and the 360 scan along with the up and down tilt movements so you can view everything. Just swipe the picture in the app on your phone in the direction of where you want to look and the camera turns there. This all seems like a really great camera and a really  great idea.  I'm Pretty Amazed that a "NON-PC guru," like myself, can actually understand the directions and set this all up by myself. Now there's a first for me! Thanks so much for for making such a great product that anyone can use!</span>

<span>I can’t believe how far baby monitors have come! With our firsts child it felt like I was looking at a black and white TV from the eighties. Now they are clear and don’t cutout all the time. Reception is really good too. Upstairs is no issue in our house. We sleep so much better knowing that we can see our child when we need to if something happens.  Very happy with this monitor and I think you will be too!</span>

<span>I was super hesitant buying this because of some of the reviews. first of all I’d like to say, the picture quality is not horrible. You’re pay $50 for a baby monitor that doesn’t need wifi and has night vision and has an excellent range, you shouldn’t expect a top tier camera for $50🤷🏼‍♀️. I can see my baby just fine with both the color and night vision. Also, there are reviews saying that the sound doesn’t work. It has a mute setting!!! If you turn the volume all the way down it mutes it! There were also reviews claiming that it just turns off and you can’t hear anything. YES. It has a power saving mode which I have absolutely loved. The power saving mode DOES NOT stay on if your baby starts crying! Once it picks up any kind of sound, the screen comes on and so does the noise. I have absolutely loved this thing. I hadn’t used it or charged it in like 3 months and decided to turn it on to see how the battery holds up. I only had one bar the way I left it but that one bar lasted 3-4 hours. And the range on it is amazing. I can go out to the barn and feed my horses (about 1,000ft)  without having to worry about wifi connection or any of that as long as I’m in range! Love love love it. Won’t ever waste money on a fancy one again. It gets the job done.</span>

<span>For the price a great camera!  I like to take pictures of the kids playing sports and whether zoomed in or not I’m not disappointed.

<span>Pros:<br/>The zoom is truly awesome in this.  No SLR lens can compare.  It's great for birdwatching, zooming in on a face in the crowd, wildlife shots, and even just cool stuff that's a long way away.<br/>4k video is great.  I'm a Canon SLR person and they don't have 4k in the low or mid-range for an SLR, so that's why I got this and it is great.<br/>Fast FPS.  The camera can take 4k video, which is 8mp at 30fps.  It claims it will do it in 4k Burst mode, which really means it takes a 4k video and will show you frame by frame and let you select ones to make photos.  Horrible to do on the camera's screen, I wound up getting software that would do it on my PC and just pulling all the images out.  Which you can do from any video, so this is an ineffective feature (at least for me).  I wanted something that would create 30 images/second, which I could go through on a real screen and post quickly.  As this feature is why I chose the Lumix over a Nikon, I'm a little annoyed at their implementation.<br/>Cons:<br/>Low light conditions for moving subjects are awful.  To the point that you will have low light issues in places you didn't realize were low light, and there is no "action" choice on the selector.  The F2.8 for the lens in wide isn't matched by a very sensitive sensor, or it's not automatically upping the sensitivity as needed.  I have a ton of blurry shots of my kids because of this.  I've played with the light levels and it is cludgey at best, completely ineffective at worst.  I've hit a sweet spot a couple of times by setting it to 1/60th of a second, but it still has issues (and my kids aren't that fast).  This is an AMAZING outdoor daytime camera, but for kids in a bounce house it doesn't work for me.<br/>No Focus Ring, so obstructed zoom is hit or miss.  Generally, zoom and autofocus are fantastic and FAST.  This means that taking a picture of wildlife that is partially obstructed by a branch means that you may get a fantastic shot of a leaf instead of the Pileated Woodpecker you were trying for.  Also, since the aperture only goes to F-8, there's a limit to how much depth you can get so that crystal clear leaf may only be 6 inches closer than the woodpecker, but, oh well.<br/>Very limited options on the selection wheel. They've got the fab 5 (auto, P, A, S, M), then Expressive (for filters), Portrait, Panoramic, C? (maybe custom, but defaults to 1080p/60fps), and then Video (for adjusting settings in video mode)<br/>My last complaint is the smallest, the features (like C above) are poorly explained on screen (aperture is only "A", which isn't useful to noobs), which means that Panasonic style features are not understandable to people with more experience.  I accidentally turned on the feature of take 3 shots and merge them which doesn't work for kids moving (but would be great for landscape shots).  Missed 1/2 of my kids' Karate class trying to fix it instead of taking pictures.<br/><br/>Overall, this is an AWESOME camera if you are taking zoomed pictures or videos in sunlight, or of non-moving subjects.  The autofocusing on a leaf can be annoying, but survivable.  The wifi, etc. is nice but not particularly useful for me.  I have tested it and it'd be great to put on a monopod and use your phone to selection shots in a crowd.  And for $300, no SLR can compare on value.  However, once Canon comes out with the T8i, if the 4k is good, I'll likely put this on craigslist.  Because of the crappy low light, I still use my Canon T4i if I'm going somewhere like the Baltimore Aquarium or Natural History Museum with my boys, and this camera should have put my T4i to bed.</span>

<span>My husband and I relocated to Michigan this past spring and it didn’t take long to realize that my I Phone11 camera was woefully  inadequate when it came to capturing the beauty of the Upper Peninsula! I did my homework (lots of reviews from several sources!) and settled on the Panasonic LUMIX FZ300. It’s my first ‘real’ camera and I love it!<br/>There is a bit of a learning curve if you’re a beginner, I got it in May and I’m still learning how to use all the settings, but there are YouTube videos by Graham Houghton that are very helpful! The zoom is, in my opinion, incredible, the picture I took of the frog eating a minnow is amazing…you can see the grains of sand on his fingers! I had no idea that frogs even HAD fingers! It was worth every penny!</span>

<span>I  bought the FZ300 as a present for my wife. She loved the FZ150 she was using but found it's limitations discouraging. She didn't want my FZ200 and didn’t like the FZ1000 I bought her at first because it was too big and heavy . I ended up adding it to my camera collection (it's a great 5 star camera that I enjoy using and I highly recommend). The FZ300 is smaller and lighter than the FZ1000 and seemed like a good upgrade for her to use.<br/><br/>Before I gave my wife the camera I tested the camera out and was extremely impressed with the huge number of improvements in the camera over the FZ200. The FZ200 has the same lens and sensor as the FZ300 but the difference that the improved processor, much better EVF and touch screen, much better build quality, weather proofing make this camera a terrific buy. There are so many other features, neither of us has tried will make this camera useful for just about any occasion<br/><br/>She likes to use just the IA setting like many users and the FZ300 works just perfect in that setting. She used the camera on our just completed cruise and was so enthusiast about it's performance, I kept hearing , "I love this camera", . "I love this camera". . In viewing her images they were coming out sharp, detailed, and perfect exposure. We were both amazed that even the lower light indoors images and video showed great detail.  I set a 1600 ISO limit and images showed very good dynamic range, much better than the FZ200 I had used previously. The best features she liked were the beautiful bright sharp EVF, the fast accurate focus and the touch screen was a WOW, She also loved the many extra features. She found the handling superb. It does feel great in the hand and the new styling matches the newer Panasonic cameras. The menus are easy and the super control panel seen on expensive cameras is terrific. You can quickly adjust any setting on the LCD without going through extensive menus like most cameras. The touch focus on the LCD screen is also a great feature. Macro images are also much easier to take and look great.<br/><br/>Some really great points and extra features that make the camera very special<br/><br/>1.  The camera has an excellent grip, it  feels good in the hands. Easy to use.<br/>2.  Very good camera build, feels more solid than the excellent FZ200<br/>3.  Camera has weather sealing and can be used in inclement weather. Not waterproof!<br/>4.  Great zoom range. From 25 to 600<br/>5.  EVF is larger and improved over FZ200 and can view scenes and info better<br/>6.  Touchscreen LCD is a great improvement which allows easier use of camera<br/>7.  Can set the focus point while viewing through EVF, focus area, extra functions buttons.<br/>8.  Constant F2.8 aperture throughout the entire zoom area. Allows more light, better low light<br/>9.  Has mechanical shutter (quiet) and electronic shutter (noise free) great in museums<br/>10. Extremely fast focus, much improved over the FZ200. Depth from defocus process?<br/>11. 4K photos, 30FPS images come out 8mp, can easily select perfect photo on LCD<br/>12. 4K video now possible. Carefully done and results are excellent.<br/>13. Camera appears very fast. Fast startup and ready to use.<br/>14. Microphone port allows adding external Microphone. Useful when windy conditions.<br/>15. Improved low light images even with the small sensor. Up to 1600 with some noise<br/>16. Camera while small dSLR sized is fairly light even with the big zoom lens.<br/>17. Can easily add filters, including Polarizers, ND filters and super closeup filters<br/>18. Includes a very good lens hood that can protect the lens without adding a UV filter<br/>19. Image quality is excellent in good light, shows good dynamic range and lots of detail.<br/>20. Wifi allows easy transfer of images. And camera control through app.<br/>21. Images and video overall is excellent with lots of keepers.<br/>22. F2.8 constant aperture lens allows improved Bokeh (background blur not usually possible with small sensor.). Mostly seen in macro images.<br/>23. Good quality macro images possible.<br/><br/>What isn’t so great with this excellent camera and could be improved.<br/><br/>1. Camera uses a very small sensor, so low light images and video are limited<br/>2. Small sensor has lower dynamic range and less detail in images.<br/>3. Could use a headphone jack for video.<br/>4. Missing extra wide angle because of fixed lens.<br/>5. Not pocket able, so camera needs a bag or strap.<br/>6. Low light images and video while tops for small sensor are still limited and can be noisy.<br/>7. Lens is integrated in camera so you really can’t change the lens.<br/>8. Camera is not inexpensive but considering all the features, it’s a good buy.<br/><br/>If you love super zoom cameras or you are a birder, this is a must buy. It won't replace the FZ1000 which has a much larger 1 inch sensor with better image quality, better low light quality and better dynamic range. But the FZ300 is a true super zoom; it stands in a class all it's own and it is well worth upgrading if you have a FZ150/FZ200 or other older Canon or Nikon super zoom. Right now as of 2016, it's the best small sensor super zoom you can buy. If the camera seems too big or expensive for you,  consider the Panasonic ZS50 which is a great pocket super zoom with an EVF or the new ZS100 which now has a 1 inch sensor and touchscreen EVF..but costs more than the FZ300..</span>

<span>This camera is my first camera ever (other then my phone). To say I’m absolutely in love with this camera is a under statement. Ever photo I’ve taken so far has came out crystal clear! The little things around my house including my kitten that with a phone doesn’t pop much absolutely come to life! I bawled when my camera came in. I have been scraping up every penny to be able to save up for this camera and I’m so happy I did. One thing I do wish it came with was a lense protecter. I have seen mentions of uv lense protecters that are supposed to be absolutely wonderful. If you do get this camera save a little extra to get one. Once I can save up I’m getting me one. It is a super easy camera to learn especially for beginners. It is not heavy at all, which comes in handy for if you are doing long photo shoots. Another thing I wish it came with was a camera cleaner. Or things that told you what was safe to clean the camera with. Obviously not water but are glasses cleaners safe? Or is there a specific camera cleaner? Not sure but other then that I’m beyond happy!</span>

<span>Let me say right now this product is PHENOMENAL!! I’ve had two other baby monitors with my oldest 4 years ago and this one is perfect! I had one that needed Wi-Fi and went though my phone it was horrible, always lost connection, didn’t alert me if baby was drying so I have to always have the app open, and now since having my first I really didn’t want a monitor that could possibly get hacked. This one has none of those issues and set up is literally just plugging it in! Easy to move room to room, great video quality and the price is amazing!
