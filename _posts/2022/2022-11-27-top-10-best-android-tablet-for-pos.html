<blockquote><em><div class="a-row a-spacing-small review-data"><span class="a-size-base review-text review-text-content" data-hook="review-body">
<span>Updated 9/21/22<br/><br/>Beware the model they send you.  There is more than one model of the TabA8.  Unfortunately I received model SM-X200.  The Samsung updates to this model are horrendous and as a result pose a security risk to the user.  it is still on Android 11, One UI 3.1 and Android May 2022 security patch.<br/><br/>I read somewhere, not confirmed that Samsung is not updating this model of the TabA8 to Android 12 and may update it to Android 13 at some point in time after Android 13 becomes available.<br/><br/>I also have a TabA7 released one year before the TabA8  and Samsung updated my TabA7 to Android 12 months ago.  Also, Samsung keeps the TabA7 up to date on Android Security patches<br/><br/>The TabA8 works fine that is why I am not giving it a one star rating  It is also very slow to charge.  A lot slower than the TabA7.<br/><br/>I can not recommend the SM-X200 model of the TabA8 at all.  Maybe if you are in a different location this model of the TabA8 will update.<br/><br/>Updated 3/22/22 See bottom of review<br/><br/>Not reviewed for typos.<br/><br/>I ordered a 4 x 64 version.  The box said 4 x 64.  The actual device as a 3 x 32.  I contacted Amazon about the problem and they sent the correct replaement immediately and I received the replacement on the same date that i was scheduled to receive the original<br/><br/>Now about the Tab A8.  I had previously purchased a Tab A7 3 x 64 from Amazon.  You should be able to find my review of it on Amazon.  This review is bascially a comparison of the A8 with the A7.<br/><br/>First off.  I recommend against buying the A8, 3 x 32  It wasn't unitl I had used Switch to copy over my apps and data from the A7 to the original A8 that I received that I discovered they had sent me a 3 x 32 intead of a 4 x 64.  If you order the 64GB version of the A8 it automatically comes with 4GB RAM.<br/><br/>In any case the transfer of the apps and data from the A7 3 x 64 to the A8 3 x 32 took close to two hours using Samsung Switch.  Transferring the data from the A7 to the A8, 4 x 64 took less than 15 minutes.  There is no doubt that the extra 1GB  RAM and 32GB of memory makes a big difference.  The Tab A7 with 64GB is a very nice tablet but compared to the Tab A8 with 64GB the Tab 8A is signficantly faster.  I opened multiple apps and switched between them without any lag.<br/><br/>As I have posted before I am no gamer so I can't comment of the gaming capabilities of either tablet but when it comes to everything else including downloading and installing updates the Tab A8 64GB is noticeably faster than the Tab A7 64GB<br/><br/>The display comparison is bit more complicated.  The sharpness of the display is better on the A7 but the Tab A8 display at 10.5" vs 10.4" of the Tab A7 is more boxy and looks more like a desktop display than a tablet display.  I put up a video on the Tab A8 and a 23" Samsung desktop display monitor.  While some of the picture is lost on the Tab A8 it isn't a lot compared to the Tab A7 which crops off a good deal of the top and bottom.<br/><br/>For some reason, the Tab A7 has a better; i.e., signficantly louder audio than the Tab A8 both running on Android 11 with Samsung UI 3.1.  The Tab A8 audio is good for watching videos etc but the Tab A7 can give you room type audio when you are listening to music.  I can't judge the distortion but in any case while the Tab 8A audio is fine the Tab A7 audio is better.<br/><br/>While neither the Tab A7 or A8 batteries will charge very fast I haven't noticed much diffenece between the two with the Tab A8 charging a bit faster using the Samsung charging block and cable that came with the Tab A8.  No comment on battery draing speed as that will always vary based upon usage.  I ams satisfied with the battery drain speed on both the Tab A7 and Tab A8,  Then again I don't play games.<br/><br/>Final comment.  The Tab A8 is year newer so it came with Android 11 vs Android 10 for Tab A7.  So it should get one more Android update and Samsung related UI update down the road.  Both are nice tablets but the extra GB of RAM along with a different CPU makes the Tab A8 a lot more enjoyable to use.<br/><br/>Update 3/22/22<br/>Heptics -  The heptics on the Tab A8 are super sensitive which makes for very light touches.  On the Tab A7 the heptics are not nearly as sensitive.<br/><br/>Startup -  With the Tab A8 there is very little impact on usage immediately upon startup after logging in.  Upon login you should be able to alsmost immediately begin doing whatever.  On the Tab A7 you have to wait for software like anti-malware to do their thing after login before you can do much of anything.  The wait time will vary depending on your software.<br/><br/>For that reason I don't turn off the Tab A7 except when I know I won't be using it for an extended period, like a day or more.  I think the extra GB of RAM in the Tab A8 makes the difference since both my Tab A8 and Tab A7 are loaded with identical software including Android 11 and Samsung 3.1 UI.<br/><br/>Battery - Samsung UI 3.1 does a good job of saving battery after it learns which takes a few days.  Therefore, leaving the Tab A8 or Tab A7 on does not drain much battery once the devices are optimized by the Samsung software as long as you turn off the display when the devices are not in use.  I also recommend turning off the display for playing music, streaming or otherwise if you want to save on battery drain.<br/><br/>In order to assure continuous playing of music when the display is off you have go to the music playing app and turn on allow in battery saving mode.</span>

<span>We are an Android family. We are a Samsung family. We have Samsung smart phones, and watches, so when my wife's old iPad finally gave up the ghost, I asked her if it would be OK to replace it with a Galaxy tablet, which made sense to me. We are both retired so I searched for a tablet that fit our budget and at the same time would fit her needs. She mainly streams and saves recipes, so I purchased the 128 GB model since it also included the 4 GB RAM, instead of 3 GB. What a tablet. The screen is bright, the sound with the quad speakers is fantastic, and it is quick. I have yet to set it up so she can make, and receive phone calls on it, which I think she will like.<br/><br/>A day after we received it there was a huge update. It is now running Android 12, the same as our phones. The only disappointment I have found so far is not being able to connect her watch to it. I hope<br/>Samsung addresses this in the future.<br/><br/>If you are in the market for a high-end budget tablet you might give the A8 a second thought. I believe you will be pleased.</span>

<span>My stepson loves his tablet. It’s so much better at evening than his last tablet which was the latest ONN tablet from WM. Better screen, camera, display, faster and plays games that lagged on his last tablet. No longer had to play on the lowest setting graphics. I know it’s not the flagship Samsung tablet but I don’t see why anyone would need the flagship honestly. This tablet is fast, looks good, works good and has great speakers and battery life! The tablet is worth the money. Glad me and my wife got it for him. He needed an upgrade and that’s exactly what he got.</span>

<span>Got a solid deal on this Galaxy tablet from Amazon. I bought this tablet mainly to control the apps for my audio system because using my iPhone or Surface ties those devices up and if I walk out the room with them Tidal and other apps will quit streaming.<br/><br/>Here’s what I like -<br/><br/>- Easy set up<br/>- clear screen<br/>- thin and lightweight<br/>- works great for all audio apps including Amazon Music, Tidal music streaming, SVS subwoofer control app, Sony headphone app, HEOS for Denon, BluOs for my BluOs Node 2i, and Audacy to name a few.<br/>-USB C connector - none of the annoying Apple lightning connector nonsense and expense. I think Apple is being forced to change the lightning connector in 2023 thanks to the European Union ruling.<br/><br/>What I don’t like<br/>-wish the battery were more robust. It seems to need charging more than I thought it would. It helps to close out all back ground apps when powering the tablet off.<br/>- Slippery case - I added a protective case<br/>- a little annoying to type on because the typing screen is not large. I have a Bluetooth keyboard for longer typing sessions<br/><br/>Overall, this is a slick tablet and it’s got exactly what I need for my audio system and the odd foray into the web. Hope that helps!</span>

<span>The box was opened, and the new tablet was replaced with a used/returned tablet with no wrapping and fingerprints all over the glass and back.  The tablet has a different IMEI number than what’s on the box. I have no idea if the tablet was new and returned, or refurbished. I paid for a NEW tablet!

<span>I had been looking for an inexpensive Android-based tablet for a while now, mainly to use specific Android-only apps for external devices. Mind you, I have already tried a few cheap Android tablets already, some from no-name brands and some from well-known brands... all of which I immediately returned after such a horrible experience. Basically anything available under $100 is such a compromise - these tablets are usually made from all plastic, with a super slow chip, a mediocre touch screen, economy-build quality, and a slow and unresponsive operating system. In other words, the literal definition of CHEAP.<br/><br/>However, the Galaxy Tab A7 Lite is none of those; for a little over $100 you get a much better experience overall! The build quality is nice, the aluminum body doesn't look or feel tacky, the touch screen is pretty responsive, and you get a smooth Android experience. Even if this is Samsung's lowest-priced tablet, it is a capable performer and a pretty good value. While it doesn't have 4k HDR and isn't powerful enough to play many AAA games, that isn't what I bought it for and that isn't what it was meant to do. I needed a simple, capable Android tablet and I found what I was looking for here; This is the difference between being "cheap" and being "low-cost"!<br/><br/>When there are deals (which is often) you can pick up the Tab A7 Lite for about $100-110. I can confidently say that the Galaxy Tab A7 Lite is the best bang-for-the-buck low-cost (not "cheap") Android tablet available!</span>

<span>I found and bought this tablet for a specific use: controlling a sound mixer. I do this inside and outside, and this past summer, using my previous tablet, I discovered that high temperatures (95-97F, in shade) made it get strangely hot in my hands as well as losing its battery life far faster than in the past. So, this Samsung "semi-ruggedized" and reasonably-priced tablet is undergoing long-term testing before I buy a second one. It's a bit heavy, but it has run for 10 hours straight so far (in shade and mild temperature), and that's the kind of lifetime I need. More experience will be needed to evaluate the display and high temperature performance.</span>

Performs similar to other Tablets in the same class but the touchscreen really sets it apart.

<span>...but it doesn't have to be one. Yes, I know, I'm comparing a $100+ device with one that at minimum costs several times more, but that's unavoidable. iPads are, after all, the gold standard of tablets, regardless of what those who stand firmly on the Android side of the fence think. Having said all of that, not everyone needs an iPad. For what it is, the Fire HD 8 Plus is a pretty decent device that will serve your content-consuming needs quite well for the price. In fact, you'll be hard-pressed to find any other Android-based tablet that even comes close to its functionality at the same price point.<br/><br/>So, a bit about the specifics. This device runs Amazon's Fire OS, which is basically a reskinned version of Android, minus the Google apps that come on most Android-based devices. If this is an immediate turn-off, fear not - installing the Google apps is a relatively simple procedure that takes no more than a few minutes. Even disregarding them, this tablet offers a surprising amount of functionality for one of its price point. The Amazon App Store has a decent selection of apps available, although I've noticed that a few of them seem to not be updated as often as their counterparts through Google Play. Again, though, if this is an issue for anyone, it's easily fixed. Needless to say, app availability isn't going to be a problem for most people.<br/><br/>Moving on, we have the specific focus of the device, which is consuming content, or more specifically, letting you line Lex Luthor's pockets. Fire OS is certain to take every opportunity available to shove content recommendations down your throat, which isn't necessarily a bad thing if you're looking for good stuff to read or watch. Fire OS includes a recommendations section at the top of the home screen that gives you recommendations based on your personal info and privacy that you signed away by using Amazon's ecosystem. For voracious readers, this can be a big boon, especially for those who like to discover new stuff to read. For others, it can be an annoyance, although really it's not so bad as it doesn't get in the way of anything.<br/><br/>So, let's talk about the hardware real quick. The overall design of this device is decent, especially considering the low price. The casing is all plastic, yet not overly cheap feeling. In fact, it feels surprisingly rugged yet is quite light, meaning that you won't be straining your hand or tiring your arm during long reading sessions. The 8-inch screen seems to be the perfect size for reading ebooks. In fact, I much prefer it to the 10-inch model for this very purpose, as the latter seems to be a bit too unwieldy for my tastes. The screen quality, while nothing to write home about, is quite sufficient and doesn't detract from the quality of your time spent using the device. Still though, unless you're a stickler for color content, those who prefer reading bog-standard books may prefer a Kindle or other e-ink based device. But really, that's all just a matter of personal preference.<br/><br/>The internals of this tablet are decent, again, for its price point. The key here, though, is the price point. You're not going to get an extremely powerful device for just over $100, so don't expect this tablet to expand your productivity options or to give you a riveting gaming experience. As an example of the latter, you won't be able to run Genshin Impact or Diablo Immortal on this device, as the hardware just isn't up to the task. For lighter games, though, it'll work fine. Just don't expect miracles.<br/><br/>Overall, there's more I could nitpick here, such as the typical laggy experience that cheaper devices suffer from when burdened by an Android-based OS, but I think most people can live with such things when it comes to low-end hardware. For what the Fire HD 8 plus promises, you'll get a pretty decent content-consuming experience.</span>

<span>Good: Inexpensive, high battery life, adequate performance, USB-C charging<br/><br/>Bad:  Hard to hold, thick and heavy for screen size, unacceptable button placement, wireless charging turns device into echo show with ads - a feature I would pay to remove!<br/><br/>I have owned three Fire HD 8 tablets and each generation has gotten more annoying to use because of compromises in the design intended to make them less expensive to produce.  I am extremely happy that Amazon has decided to market this upgraded version with 3 GB of RAM because that is now the minimum needed to run Android or Fire OS smoothly. The 1.5 that came with my second Fire HD8 never worked - it just isn't enough anymore, whereas the 2 GB that came with my first HD8  waa plenty for that era.  I think Amazon was foolish to make that change on the base HD8 because of the added frustration to the end user, but at least there is a choice to upgrade to this "plus" version with its frustration-free 3GB setup.  Is the experience as smooth or responsive as even the least expensive iPad?  Certainly not.  But those start at $400 and this was closer to $120.  What I really want is a $185 option that combines this specification or better with the physical design and form factor of earlier Fire HD8 generations, because when it comes to physical design this generation of Fire tablets is extremely annoying!  I am sure the changes are all designed to minimize cost but please find a better to do that than to put the power and volume buttons so close together with such a similar size and feel.  It is far too easy to press the power button to begin with because it protrudes to far from the case and doesn't have a very strong spring, but when you put it right next to an identical feeling volume button that is just unacceptable!  There is good reason why almost every phone and tablet in the world has these buttons in different locations ( often opposite sides or ends of the phone.)<br/><br/>I happen to believe that it probably would work to have both buttons on the same end as the charger and headphone jack but not if you put them this close together, and give them exactly the same tactile feel and the same overly light spring rate. Please at least recess the power button, use a different surface texture and a stiffer spring. Or better yet move it to the opposite corner where the headphone Jack is now.<br/><br/>And for users with the current, unfortunate design you could eliminate the worst effects with a software update. Just modify the software to require a longer press of the power key before it shuts down the display.  If a one-second press were required then it would eliminate 90% of the instances when I have accidentally shut down the screen trying n to change the volume.  With no security options other than a pass code, tis means I almost every time I try to adjust the volume while listening to a podcast or watching a video I have that experience interupted and I end up having to enter my pass code and physically restart what I was listening to just because I tried to adjust the volume.  This design choice just doesn't work.  Fix it, Amazon!<br/><br/>Another cost saving design choice is that Amazon has allowed the HD8 tablets to get thicker each generation, which I agree is probably reasonable.  But between the thicker body and the much smaller bezel compared to previous generations, I am finding this version much more difficult to hold.  I actually think the sensitivity of the screen might also be a factor because if I put fingers on the front edge if the glass at all this registers as a touch. So to prevent that my fingers must stay on the plastic, and there just isn't enough plastic on the front bit the tablet to get a good grip.  That gives the impression of the tablet being heavier and more awkward than it probably is.  And again this could be an issue that might be addressed with software if the screen sensitivity could be decreased a bit to reject unintended "touches" at the edges ( in this case beyond the edges). of the screen.<br/><br/>My final gripe is going to be about the behavior of the device when put on a wireless charger.  Oddly, when I want to use a wireless charger my intention is to actually charge the device.  It is not to turn my tablet, for which I paid extra to have ads removed from the lock screen into an always on Echo Show with advertising!<br/><br/>I'm sure there are some people who might actually use an Echo Show and for them this must feel like an amazing value.  Like getting a second device for free.  But I just want it gone.  I would never willingly use, much less purchase, an Echo Show, particularly one with a working camera, because I can't accept the privacy and security risk. And I certainly don't want another device showering.me with advertising.<br/><br/>That said, I don't object at all into Amazon including the Echo Show functionality with the tablet, or even having it run by default when you connect it to a wireless charger, but there needs to be clear documentation about how to control this feature and how to turn it off both permanently and temporarily.  Without that I am actually losing two features I specifically paid for on this tablet, wireless charging and freedom from advertising.  Please do a much better job explaining this feature and how to control it as you update the device software</span>

<span>I do not mean "Wild" kindly, but I'll get to that shortly. Sorry for the long read, but I have a lot of thoughts about this particular product to inform you, the end-user of your purchasing decision before you commit a purchase, and as a responsible citizen of the Internet, I've heavily tested the tablet hands-on to see what I can make it do, how I can make it work and where Amazon's hires could improve the overall experience for a multi-adult household.<br/><br/>The tablet itself is functional. What else is there to say about it? Inside a home or building, so long the sun isn't shining directly on it the display is bright, with a clear, crisp display and along with a decent battery much bigger than your current handheld mobile device, you also get anywhere between a mediocre and acceptable tablet use experience, depending on how much money you hand to Amazon. I painfully regret not going with the Fire HD 10, but I am a bit of a cheapskate and after having seen what comes with the Fire HD Kids' Pro 8 through an encounter with a daughter of my mother's friend, I figured the Fire HD 8 Plus would be the same exact experience — and I can happily say, it is.<br/><br/>The inclusion of a three-pole phone socket for headphones and TF / micro SD slot for extra storage practically makes it the ideal tablet computer… until you try to use it as a multi-user tablet computer. But we'll get to those gripes later. First impressions of the hardware makes it seem like the absolute perfect device for personal and work use, domestic and abroad. A simple tablet with great features. Except for a GSM / SIM slot but if you already have a mobile handheld, the Fire can use wireless tethering whenever the tablet needs access to the Internet where WiFi isn't available, and it can do calls via WiFi so that's something if your friends aren't using any of the supported social network platforms available through Amazon's app market.<br/><br/>Fire OS on the other hand, that's uhm — fun. Yes, fun. If you receive nothing else from this, should you be the sole adult of the tablet, then you have nothing to worry about. Everything just works — for you. For anyone else? Yeah, nah. Show mode is honestly a great inclusion, as well Alexa Hands-Free — it's like if you have a general-purpose tablet, Amazon Show desktop unit and phone (which can only do calls via WiFi) for what was at the time of Prime Day anywhere between sixty and eighty dollars depending on device capabilities. What a bargain!<br/><br/>…For the primary user. Second adult? Nah, can't do Show Mode, Alexa Hands-Free or WiFi calling. But children can do calls with approved contacts and permission from their parents! That hardly makes any sense — if you're not a child you don't get to make calls beyond the primary profile? Why? Speaking of kids, if you think that kids' launcher or adult settings will let you move off all of the kids' apps to an SD card, ha ha nope. So your child will very likely make using the tablet almost impossible after they stuff the internal storage with nothing but pointless games.<br/><br/>For a couple, it makes even less sense to buy this for the intent of using voice recognition features. Sure, auto guy and shop girl can keep their profiles separate, but only one of them get the privilege of using all of the tablet's features. A second adult profile is like a grown-up kid, and feels almost demeaning, which likely means whoever wears the pants between two people will be the one with the primary account which does everything. And what if they want to share applications? There's no easy way to do this beyond reinstalling them on the other profile. I've looked, and there seems to be no way of easily sharing apps between adult profiles which especially makes installation of such things as Google Play a major drag without third-party guidance and tools.<br/><br/>It's an Amazon device, so of course it will advertise Amazon everything — even Washington Post. If you don't use that service, too bad can't disable. If you don't care about Amazon's other services, too bad shove it in a folder on the Fire Launcher. Without tinkering beyond what Amazon allows you to do, it kind of makes using the tablet a terrible experience being inundated with all of these Amazon-owned things at once, and for some people the constant upselling is enough to warrant a return.<br/><br/>If you can get over all of that — and again, if you are the sole adult of the tablet, none of the above save for the upsells are really an issue — then you have yourself a capable and handy little Android-based tablet which will do almost everything you want. A solid product with a mediocre and terribly flawed OS, but one if you've committed your entire life to Amazon may be welcome. As I exhibit no such brand loyalty I'm exceedingly annoyed, but all of the thorns and papercuts are nothing a little bit of tinkering cannot cleave and become rid of.<br/><br/>EDIT 07/06/21.1: Minor correction, seems like while four-pole may fit, I can't use external mic with the tablet or Fire OS doesn't disclose how to do this.<br/>EDIT 07/06/21.2: Grammar and error corrections</span>

<span>I've only had this one for a week or so, I can't comment on battery life, it's been fine for me but I haven't really run it down yet. I really like that it does wireless charging without the proprietary dock.  This one replaced one of the ones that did that, and it limited you to either always taking it out of the case (to use one with a screen cover), or never covering the screen.  I have a magnetic screen on the new one and it charges with the screen covered on my phone charger.  Have had several versions, including the HDX which had better screen resolution, but I honestly can't see much difference with a screen this small.  It was easy to get set up and on line.  If you have a trade in and do it when there's a deal going, it's worth it to upgrade.</span>

<span>I am not an Android guy. Although I am always fascinated by Android devices and products. I have owned quite a few Chinese knock-offs and a few Xiaomi brand phones but nothing ever lasted. In retrospect, I didn’t give them much of a chance. I am an Apple guy. I love Mac and Apple products. What I don’t like? The price. What I do like? The quality. Apple has maintained quality products for some time. I’ve had many iPhones, iPads, Mac Pros, Macbook Pros, Macbooks, Mac minis, and iMacs. Our whole office here in Ghana is on mac. Why? Reliability and longevity. Ok, so I’ve got the fanboying out the way, on to the subject of this post.<br/><br/>Why did you buy this thing?<br/>Well, simply put, on one of my trips back to the US earlier this year, my 13″ Macbook Pro died and I needed a replacement. I loved the 13″ size for going back and forth to the office and it was a good “beater” laptop. I have a loaded 16″ Macbook Pro that I prefer to keep in pristine shape for editing video and graphics. I figured let’s try the 12.4″ tablet and see if it can handle what I am throwing at it.<br/><br/>I LOVE THIS TABLET.<br/><br/>I am typing on it right now for this post. I was skeptical of having an Android tablet after having a few knock-offs and bad experiences with them, but this thing just keeps getting better. The only downside? No iMessaging or integration of Mac apps. I can live without that. In fact, it has me wondering if I should switch all of my note-taking, list-making, and stuff to Google apps.<br/><br/>Speed<br/>This thing is fast. I’m not just talking fast, I’m talking lighting fast. I am constantly shocked at how responsive and quick everything is. Websites load fast, apps load without hesitation, and streaming is a joy. With the Qualcomm SM7225 Octa-Core processor, this thing delivers. My kids use iPad devices for streaming and sometimes school. My son has one of the later models of the regular iPad. This Samsung tab smokes it. I mean trail of fire smokes it.<br/><br/>Screen<br/>The screen on this device is one of the best I’ve ever seen or used. I’m serious. I like it better than the iPads I own. It’s clear, and crisp and the 4K video looks incredible on it. Let’s put it this way, I’d rather watch Netflix on this tablet than on my 16″ Macbook Pro. Even when viewing bad or old footage on YouTube, I’ve found the quality is amazing. I’m not sure what they’re doing over there at Samsung but they better keep doing it. If you don’t believe me, go find one on display at a store. You’ll be a believer quickly. Even with fingerprints of my own and my kids, this thing is still crisp and clear. For what it’s worth, I do not put on-screen protectors on my devices. I don’t like the loss of clarity and function with screen protectors.<br/><br/>Battery Life<br/>I have yet to have this thing die on me. Granted I don’t use it enough to kill the battery. Even after two days of not being on the charger, it was still at 60%. I couldn’t believe it. Time will tell how long that lasts but if it’s this good to start with I don’t feel worried about that at all. Maybe when I fly again back to the States I’ll test how long it lasts on a flight.<br/><br/>Accessories<br/>With this tablet, I bought the Amazon suggested keyboard and case made by Fintie. For all intents and purposes, it’s not a bad case. Do I wish I had bought the Samsung keyboard and case? Sure. But the cost was a bit high and I didn’t think it was a deal-breaker on the tablet. The Fintie case works well enough and offers a few options for pen storage. I do like that the tablet came with a tablet pen which is a good selling point, even if you don’t use it.<br/><br/>Conclusion<br/>All in all, this tablet is a winner. The screen alone is worth the price but as an added bonus the speed just feels unmatched. If I had to go back and choose again, I’d likely choose it again. If you’re an Apple person, like I am, this is a worthy device to add to your arsenal.</span>

<span>I had previously gotten a cheap tablet, it had several "small issues" at first (randomly restarted almost daily, battery life was poor despite the indicator saying otherwise, games would randomly crash). After two years, it became almost unusable. It would shut off after about 15 minutes if not connected to power (despite battery indicator saying 90 percent). After this experience, I decided to not be cheap and spend more money on a good tablet. I found this model and I have seen almost no issues since I bought it back in March. Battery life is excellent. Have not seen any random restarts.  The games that would frequently crash on the old device are now working flawlessly.  I did get a warranty just in case this device would fail. However so far so good. It has been worth the extra money that I spent on it.</span>

<span>I was fairly happy with this tablet overall for the short period of time that I had it.  I've had to manually reset it a few times, but it was more than usable, but didn't have a great battery life.<br/><br/> The other day the touch screen suddenly stopped responding, which hadn't happened before--only some annoying freezing with sounds being warped.  I attempted to reset the tablet yet again and when it turned back on, the screen still wasn't responding.  Finally, it went to some kind of crash menu that indicated it was calibrating the screen, so I left it alone to repair itself for a while.  It seemed like it was taking a long time, though, so I decided to reset it again only for it not to turn back on at all.  Whenever it was on the charger, it just showed a picture of a battery flashing red but wouldn't charge.<br/><br/> I attempted all the old tricks to reset it, but nothing worked.  I even tried to take the back cover off to see if I could just remove the battery.  I'm no tech expert, but it looked very cheaply assembled to me and the battery was actually strapped down with tape.  The so-called volume and power buttons that turned out to be cheap pieces of plastic fell out and I could not get them to pop back into place when I put the cover back on.  I had to use a paper clip to access the real buttons because they were pretty deep inside the cover and I still wanted to attempt to reset it.  The real buttons were so cheap, though, that ended up causing permanent damage to power button.<br/><br/>Warranty obviously voided, not that I'd want a replacement after all that anyways.  Total waste of $$$.</span>

<span>Do not buy this if you're looking for the fastest tablet. That's not what it is, though it's by no means slow. It will take a lot more abuse than the fastest tablets available for the same price. You can stand outside in the rain or snow and use the touchscreen when it's wet. You can drop it in the mud, pick it up, wipe it off, and keep using it. I wouldn't take it scuba diving though. I will take it off-roading. This one has enough storage to preload maps for off-road hiking/biking/riding/driving for when there's no signal at all.<br/><br/>I've seen several questions about whether this works with Verizon, and several people answer that it doesn't. Those people are wrong. The Enterprise/LTE/4G/WiFi version does work with Verizon. It should work with others. Find this model number (SM-T577UZKGN14) on the Samsung site to check. Samsung knows. Those other people don't.<br/><br/>This is the third tablet I've used my Verizon SIM card in. The first was a tablet I bought through Verizon. The second was a TabActive2, and now I'm using the same SIM card in this TabActive3. This does not apply to the WiFi-only version. Don't confuse the two.<br/><br/>I pulled the SIM card out of the TabActive2, inserted it in the TabActive3, restarted the device as requested, and a few minutes later the line was active on the new device. I ignored Verizon's emailed instructions, because they don't appear to apply to swapping a current SIM card into a new device. I even restored a Google backup from the 2 to the 3 and saved a lot of time installing apps.<br/><br/>So, why this tablet? It's rugged. It's Samsung. I really like having an 8" tablet. It works with Verizon.<br/><br/>Why 4G/LTE? It's not 5G. I drive a truck through at least 5 states on a regular basis, and in some areas the signal constantly switches between 4G and 5G and the data connection is interrupted. When I can't access online banking, credit cards, and apps relating to business with my 5G phone, I often can with a 4G tablet. I have unlimited data on a second plan for only $10/mth, since I already have a smartphone plan. No hotspot/WiFi needed.<br/><br/>Why upgrade? My TabActive2 only had 16GB of internal storage. The TabActive3 I bought has 128GB. The TabActive3 has DEX. The TabActive2 didn't. I didn't manage to hurt the 2, and the 3 is physically very similar. The 3 has a faster CPU, and a faster GPU.<br/><br/>From the beginning, everything about the TabActive2 as a usable tablet simply wasn't enough. It wasn't fast enough. It didn't have enough storage. But it was rugged. It still is. This is the first time I've upgraded when the old tablet still worked as well as it did when I bought it. It appears that the TabActive3 is just as rugged.<br/><br/>Con: The biggest downside to these is that there's no external charger that I can find for the replaceable battery. At least I can't find one. Maybe one exists. I have no evidence of that. It is possible to buy another compatible battery, but I can't find any way to charge said battery other than to charge it in the tablet, and it's a pain to get to, because of the lengths Samsung went to to seal the battery compartment. The battery life is substantial, partly due to the less-than-premium performance, but it would really be nice to be able to easily carry a fully-charged spare.</span>

<span>I got this because my old PIXAL tablet is on it's last legs. and as a book reader &amp; audible it is ok.  However, some big gripes on this.  1. you can ONLY get AMAZON antivirus. AVAST, which is the top rated free android antivirus, isn't available because Amazon won't play nice with Google. Seriously?  Nor can you get vipre, Norton or any other antivirus i've ever heard of.  Their top ranked antivirus they DO offer is from INDIA.  (not that they TELL you this, you have to search it out for yourself).  2. as a book reader?  two problems.  1. If i want to put a book in a collection, they don't make this very user friendly.  I have over 750 books.  I'd like to group them the way I want to group them.  The automatic system will assume that EVERY book by a given author is part of ONE series. Ain't so dudes.  2. display.  My old Pixel has a better display.  you'd think that a reader MADE for reading would be better than a tablet that was a "not quite a laptop" generic.  but it ain't.  If I had to do it over again?  I MIGHT get the kindle as i do (see above) a LOT of reading.  BUT I probably would look into finding a small lap top that would do more .</span>

<span>I've had my Fire HD 8 plus for a couple weeks now.  Paid a little extra for the 64 GB and without Special Offers. So far, I'm really liking it. There are a few things that need to be done to make this tablet great. And that's to add the Google Play Store. Too bad it's not included but I can see Amazon's reasoning. Thank goodness it's not too difficult to add the Play Store. Took me about 15 minutes after following the step by step instructions found on the internet. I will admit the Fire OS takes a little getting used to compared to regular Android. And after reading some of the negative reviews about certain problems I think many are just user errors. For me this tablet has been problem free. If I run into any difficulties I just find the answers and solutions on the internet. I highly recommend this tablet if you are willing to put in a little time and brain power to get it set up the way it should have been out of the box.</span>

<span>I like my Kindle Fire tablets. I give them as gifts. However, I do not purchase with "Special Offers" as for a $20 price break you will be bombarded with ads. I also purchase added memory, as much as is offered. Costs more but well worth it. That makes it possible for me to do the most and enjoy movies, adding pictures, Zoom and more. Really makes a difference!</span>

<span>Battery lasts a good 2-3 days when just doing mostly word processing with an hour of watching videos. I enjoy the tablet design. Pen works well and automatically charges while docked.<br/><br/>Only problem is the keyboard. When it sits on your lap, the mouse pad does not work as it needs a hard surface under it.</span>

<span>Okay so let me just start off by saying that I have never used a Chromebook or a detachable tablet with a keyboard before. This was my first one in both cases.<br/><br/>Let's start with the Chromebook side of it. Before buying this product, I had done some research on how Chromebooks work and I thought I would be able to adapt to them. Boy, was I wrong! The GUI is too MacOS-like and as someone who is a long time Windows user, I was hoping for something more familiar. One thing I realized right away was that I had to be logged into my Google account at all times and that gave me an uneasiness of feeling like a data-mine. I also tried playing games on it but it just didn't work out. The feeling of gaming on it is super awkward and sometimes the games would lag.<br/><br/>Alright now let's move on to the tablet/keyboard side of it. The keyboard is a lot flimsier than I expected. The tablet itself is very bulky compared to mainstream tablets like iPads. The back cover is completely magnetic and can come off entirely which happened a few times when I was trying to set it upright. One important thing this device made me realize was that I'm just not into tablets.<br/><br/>I thought this product would help substitute my laptops but instead I learned a very important lesson from all this. Be happy with what you've got. Some things are just not worth it. If you've used Chromebooks or tablets with detachable keyboards before, then maybe this device won't be a problem for you. But if you've never used either one, then let this be a cautionary tale.</span>
