<span>Bought this for our granddaughter as her first non-iphone camera.  She is thrilled with it so far.  It has a fully automatic program mode that allowed her to begin shooting good looking photos immediately.  She loves horses and has been using the camera to take photos and videos.  Yet the camera has many advanced features like a serious telephoto zoom, full manual, aperture preferred, shutter preferred modes, and much more.  Nice touch screen to allow easy access to menu options.  At this price, it seems like a very good deal.</span>

<span>I have a degree in photography, and I currently have a Cannon DSLR. I have been looking for a bridge camera with a large optical zoom to take with me on trips, so I don't have to carry 3-4 lenses.  I also wanted to have a camera the I would be allowed into concert venues. This camera is light and easy to use. The main reason I purchased this camera is the ability to save as RAW photos. I admittedly have only had the camera for a few days. I am loving it. The ability to shoot in 4K burst came in handy while photographing the hummingbirds in my yard. I purchased the camera thru Adorama. Received the camera before it was expected. Customer Service is quick and efficient. Thanks Adorama!</span>

<span>I'm one of those photographers who while on a budget still likes to have toys to play with. This camera is one of those many toys I've purchased over the years. It was never intended to be a daily shooter for me just something I took out on occasion to take some pictures with for fun. Like, for instance, the train yard not far from my house is a fave place to go take pics. The tracks that lead to them and yard itself provide some fantastic opportunities. Lots of great shots. It actually does perform quite well and I was pleased at the quality of the resulting pictures.<br/><br/>But there is one major drawback and that's the processing time between shots. And if you're the type of person who wants to take that next shot immediately this is not your camera. I used it in sport mode the time at the yards so I'd get get between 3 and 5 shots per click of the shutter. And the downtime between shots is anywhere between 5 to 20 seconds. So you get this spot on shot of a bird sitting on the caboose and then want to get a shot of the bird closer up you'll be waiting for a few moments. Which will likely mean the opportunity is gone by the time the camera is ready again. This makes it nearly impossible to use in a setting such as sports where you have to be ready at all times.<br/><br/>That aside the pictures you get are pretty great. The zoom is fantastic (especially with a tripod) and will get you close to places that you normally can't get too. I'd say it's definitely worth the money. I'm very pleased with the purchase overall. But definitely upgrade the included memory card.</span>

Cam v3 is the 3rd generation of Wyze’s flagship camera, Wyze Cam. Like its predecessor Wyze Cam v3 lets you see and record 1080p video right from the Wyze mobile app. New to Wyze Cam v3 is its waterproof design allowing for outdoor installation with an IP65 rating. Wyze Cam v3 also takes advantage of an all-new Starlight Sensor which allows for extreme low-light performance and shows great detail in the dark. With Wyze Cam v3's color night viewing, night time video recording appears as if it’s day time.

<span>I like the picture quality, day and night, and I like the WYZE app. I did have a problem at first but no fault of WYZE.  I was confusing 5G and 5 GHz. I have a dual-band router, meaning that I can use either the 5 GHz band or the 2.4 GHz band. I never knew any of this. Anyhow, for whatever reason I was using the 5 GHz band and the WYZE camera will not work with 5 GHz.  Fixing this was simple in my phones wifi settings and this made the camera work.  My fault. My ignorance. I was talking to Customer Service and that conversation cleared all this up for me. I have a small tablet (Android) that I used to register an account on the WYZE app and then to successfully connect to the camera. I then downloaded the WYZE app onto my iPhone and just by logging into my account and I started to see the same that my tablet is showing me.  You need to use the app to understand how it works; just like any new app.  I found it well organized and user friendly.  Regarding their Cloud service for $19.99 for a full year, I am going to buy this right before my free trial expires. That's not a lot of money and worth it. I bought this camera #1 because it had better reviews than most, and #2, just like the price for a year's worth of their cloud service, the price for the camera, itself, is very reasonable. I chose to use a screw to mount the camera on my wood storage building. I get notifications on my phone (if I have WYZE notifications turned on), that alerts me to any strange movements. Today is kind of windy and I'm getting some wind movements setting off alerts.  No problem, I simply turned off notifications on my phone until the wind goes away.</span>

<span>I researched So many cameras, I am SO happy that I went with this one! It is inexpensive but works perfectly. Easy to set up, just plug it into the wall whenever I want to use it. It sits on the window ledge and gazes at my front door/walk and driveway. I set the viewing area to Not pickup the street else I get notified for every car that goes by! It detects everything, lighting changes, insects, the cats hitting the camera - and you can let it know via the app what the "event" was to improve the ai. You get notified on your phone via the app if you want to, and there's a little picture of the event, or you can go to Wyze app and see a few second video clip of each event. There are frequent deals for the Wyze subscriptions (required to receive notifications and have event videos saved) and it's well worth it, I think mine was only $10-20 for a year subscription. The images are clear even at night and through my window pane or screen and the detection is extremely accurate. Plus if I don't want it on I just unplug. No Batteries needed! Great purchase. Get this one!</span>

<span> EDIT: I uploaded a video of the camera's sound quality in action, so if you view the video turn on your sound BUT KEEP THE VOLUME DOWN (initially). No need for bleeding ears.<br/><br/>During the Wyze portions of the video I was sitting roughly 20 feet away and six feet below the camera; There should be no feedback at that distance.<br/><br/>During the iPhone portion (where I filmed the same space as the one the V3 is normally set up to film) I was roughly six feet away and six feet below the camera. The point was to capture the same sounds in the same room.<br/><br/>All the videos were taken very early in the morning, with no traffic or human noise outside, and with what I'd call regular ambient interior noise (the humming of appliances, the running of a computer in the vicinity, etc). No other people were present to make noise inside.<br/><br/>The first portion of the video is the sound that the V3 produces when I am viewing the live feed. It was screen-captured with my iPhone.<br/><br/>The second portion is a comparison demonstrating the sound my iPhone picks up in the same general space, at the same general time, in the exact same conditions, and with the exact same ambient noise in the background as in the first portion; This is not to show how much better the iPhone's mic is than the Wyze (obviously it's better) but to give you an idea as to what noise and sounds were actually present in the room while I was viewing the V3's live feed of the same room, and capturing it with my phone camera.<br/><br/>The third portion is the same space with the same ambient noise, plus conversation from the television that is eight feet from the V3. I chose a scene that sounds a lot like regular conversation, set it to conversation volume, and it has some light score that comes in at the end.<br/><br/>The final portion is what my iPhone picked up in the same space during the same time and conditions, and while playing the exact same scene/conversation on the TV at the same volume as while capturing it on the V3. If you listen VERY carefully you MIGHT be able to pick up a word or two in the V3's video that you can compare to the iPhone's. Maybe. It took me three tries. Hint: listen for the word "Garrett".  Hope the video helps you make a more informed purchasing decision!<br/><br/>Original Review:<br/><br/>Picture is ok. Night vision/low light is very good. Motion detection is spot-on. The camera looks good, design-wise.<br/><br/>Why the one star?<br/><br/>Because that's where the good ends.<br/><br/>The problem is the mic/sound quality is appalling bad. That's such an old, tried-and-true tech I have no idea how they managed to bungle it so much, but managed they did.<br/><br/>Maybe they are using the very cheapest, most absolute garbage quality components on the face of the earth, which sucks, because better components don't cost that much, especially wholesale. They're just squeezing every penny out of profit and selling garbage wrapped up and promoted as quality.<br/><br/>Frustrating.<br/><br/>So, what sound does it pick up?<br/><br/>From what I've read online there are various audio manifestations/issues ranging from nearly no sound at all, all the way to my problem, which is the sound picked up becomes a garbled, distorted, feed-backed  jumble of sometimes jarring noises that maybe sort-of could be interpreted as words (in the case of people taking) but nearly nothing's decipherable by any stretch of the imagination.<br/><br/>Pet noises, like barks, meows, growls, etc. are literally non-existent. If it picks it up at all it's just converted to "noise".<br/><br/>All other sound is just as bad. Sometimes there's these random-seeming staticky "bangs" every once in a while. Who knows what that is.<br/><br/>I hate it.<br/><br/>You hear that developers?<br/><br/>I. Hate. This. Camera.<br/><br/>And I wish I didn't because otherwise I like so much about it.<br/><br/>But, alas,  I need sound so I am able to use the function where you talk to someone through the camera and hear them when they respond. I also need to be able to hear what's going on with my pets.<br/><br/>I need to be able to hear when the camera's motion-detection is tripped and the cause of the trip has moved out of the line of the camera but is still out there rustling and bumping around, or otherwise making noise out on my porch and the surrounding area.<br/><br/>If I had children I wouldn't be able to hear them, or speak to them through the camera. or hear when one is crying.<br/><br/>So, be forewarned, if any of the above is one of your needs/goals you probably won't be able to do that with this camera. Buy elsewhere.<br/><br/>It's incredibly stupid they didn't fix this problem before releasing the V3. A lot of people online report the V2 being awful as well, so the developers knew. That means you shouldn't put off buying one for when the next gen comes out (whenever that is). They probably won't fix it.<br/><br/>The worst part, I think, is it doesn't support the use of an external mic, which would be such an easy solve. There's no input port and the simple hardware and software to support that, and that really is stupid AF. If it did allow the connecting of an external mic all I'd have to do is plug one in and I would have the sound I need. At least then I wouldn't be writing this scathing review. It would be a win-win for everyone!<br/><br/>But no.<br/><br/>Finally, apparently contacting customer support is a total waste of time, and the people you talk to (bless their hearts, it isn't really their fault) have no tech experience or understanding whatsoever of how these things work. I don't know about you, but I find that exhausting. If one were to spend the time necessary to troubleshoot all the garbage products we wind up with one would never have time to do anything else, and even with that effort 95% of the time it results in no improvement, and no resolution. I'm tired of it. Just make a solid product, and when something goes wrong, replace it or refund the money, don't make anyone jump through hoops.<br/><br/>Finally, fix the issue, fast. And don't repeat it in the next iteration.<br/><br/>Long and the short of it is I need a camera with a functioning mic and/or that has an input for an external mic. The end. That shouldn't be too much to ask, even at the price-point these cameras are at.<br/><br/>I regret buying these, as now they're going to be tossed after I buy another brand (according to message boards even cheapo Chinese no-name brands have a better mic than these things!). What a waste of time, money, and resources.</span>

<span>my only gripe is the "color night vision" the color only works if theres enough light to allow it to work. so inside with all lights turned off, it will not be color. however, the b&amp;w night vision works great and has a very sharp picture. during the day, the quality is top notch with the exception of whiteout effect if its bright outside. for example, the inside looks great but the windows, through sheer curtains, looks like oversaturated white light and if its aimed at a door, you will not see anyone if the door is opened halfway. but that happens with any camera going from average light inside to bright outside. i have not tested it with the door wide open but i plan to add an outdoor camera at the door and garage so i see regardless. i bought this camera to keep an eye on my pets and kids when they get home from school if no one is home. highly recommend.</span>

<span>I've been a hobby/amateur photographer for about 10 years now. I went from a simple point and shoot to an early Canon Rebel, which was probably the wrong move in hindsight. Having to switch lenses all the time for a day out with the family for "snaps" got so annoying that I stopped bringing a camera and relied on our phones.  Phones can take photos, sure, but unless you're a latest model smartphone user (iphone and pixel) the photos are only ever going to be good enough to share on social media, and *maybe* good enough to print 4x6.<br/><br/>I wanted to get back to shooting photos, but I didn't want the hassle of carrying a bunch of gear with me if we were just going to an amusement park, or at a picnic. I looked at Canon bridge/superzoom cameras, (all I had ever owned) but at the 400 dollar range, there was always something about the cameras that I didn't like. Nikon was no better. My sister bought a P900, with it's 600mm zoom, so I looked at that, but I wasn't impressed with the video features (something I have an interest in), the stabilization, lack of hot shoe, and the aperture settings on the lens.<br/><br/>Shopping for cameras means compromise. A bridge/superzoom camera is a compromise. You get a small sensor, and you're stuck with the lens that's on it.  With the constant f2.8 Leica lens, I started looking hard at the FZ300, and found that it's a VERY popular camera worldwide. Graham Houghton has a ton of tutorial videos on YouTube for the camera, and a user's guide on Amazon that dives super deep into the camera's functions and features. If you want to get creative with photography, and want to have an inexpensive all purpose camera, the Panasonic Lumix FZ300 is an excellent choice. The 4k video is great, but most people will only ever use 1080p. The nice thing about 4k is that it can be downsampled to 1080p to produce super clean video.  What is really neat about the FZ300 is the 4k photo mode, which gives you burst photos at 30 frames per second. Great to get action shots of your kid's sports, or wildlife action.<br/><br/>Pros:<br/>Convenient all in one camera for quick snaps<br/>Plenty of "creative" modes<br/>Full Manual control for advanced amateurs<br/>Fast f2.8 glass<br/>4K video, Photo modes<br/>TILTY FLIPPY TOUCHSCREEN. You'll fall in love with this feature. I did.<br/>Image stabilization<br/><br/>Cons:<br/>12MP is small for 2019, but about max for this sensor size<br/>24mm isn't very wide angle<br/>Small sensor (typical with most bridge cameras at this price)<br/>High ISO performance is weak (typical for sensor size)<br/>Battery and memory card slot on the bottom interferes with tripod quick release (there is a solution)<br/><br/>Overall:<br/><br/>Fantastic performer for the price. Not as compact as a 100 dollar point and shoot, but a wonderful start to a photography hobby, or for someone who wants a GOOD camera without the headaches of interchangeable lenses. With the addition of the 4K video, it's perfect for someone who is interested in photography and videography. You can step up to the FZ1000 or FZ2500, but you lose zoom range, but gain MP and sensor size, but you're paying DSLR prices for those cameras. If your budget is $1000 and you want a great camera, look at Canon and Nikon APS-C size DSLRs with 2 kit lenses.  If your budget is $4-500 you really can't beat this little gem.<br/><br/>Recommended Accessories:<br/><br/>ALZO liberator offset mount (moves tripod mount out of the way of the battery door)<br/><br/>https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B019E67Q4S/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o05_s00?ie=UTF8&amp;psc=1<br/><br/>K&amp;F Concept 62'' DSLR Tripod, Lightweight and Compact Aluminum Camera Tripod with 360 Panorama Ball Head Quick Release Plate for Travel and Work (TM2324 Black)<br/><br/>https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B015CGRREI/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o06_s00?ie=UTF8&amp;psc=1<br/><br/>Extra Batteries<br/><br/>https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0768TVNR9/?coliid=IDXG6N4V47V09&amp;colid=3AROT89CSYJ9V&amp;psc=1&amp;ref_=lv_ov_lig_dp_it<br/><br/>Advanced accessories:<br/><br/>Circular Polarizer<br/><br/>https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00004ZCAU/?coliid=I2YVFP9ZRSCDFH&amp;colid=3AROT89CSYJ9V&amp;psc=1&amp;ref_=lv_ov_lig_dp_it<br/><br/>Variable ND filter<br/><br/>https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07FQB9L81/?coliid=I15IBTBRTJNRHJ&amp;colid=3AROT89CSYJ9V&amp;psc=1&amp;ref_=lv_ov_lig_dp_it</span>

<span>My husband and I relocated to Michigan this past spring and it didn’t take long to realize that my I Phone11 camera was woefully  inadequate when it came to capturing the beauty of the Upper Peninsula! I did my homework (lots of reviews from several sources!) and settled on the Panasonic LUMIX FZ300. It’s my first ‘real’ camera and I love it!<br/>There is a bit of a learning curve if you’re a beginner, I got it in May and I’m still learning how to use all the settings, but there are YouTube videos by Graham Houghton that are very helpful! The zoom is, in my opinion, incredible, the picture I took of the frog eating a minnow is amazing…you can see the grains of sand on his fingers! I had no idea that frogs even HAD fingers!

<span>I purchased the Yolobox Pro because it looked like it would be great for quick setup for short interview type programs and to advertise for my legal practice.  Being a one person crew, size (weight) and ease of setup and use was critical for me.  I paired it with three OBSBOT Tiny 4K and OBSBOT UVC to HDMI Adapters and I have three remote controlled PTZ cameras.<br/><br/>The Yolobox Pro has numerous effects such as chromakey (green screen), titles, Picture in Picture that one would expect to only be in a much more expensive device.  It allows me to program in camera changes and titles (lower thirds).  I can bring in slide presentations (Keynote and PowerPoint) though one of the HDMI inputs.  It also allows me to bring in videos through the SD card.  That's a lot of power in a small package.<br/><br/>I can put everything including lights, and stands into two carry-on sized bags.<br/><br/>I am looking forward to creating product with this device.</span>

<span>10/1/22<br/>I can say I was bummed when I had to take on the adventure of finding a different outfit for supporting our church services since SlingStudio's going out of the business.  I needed something that was easy to use and would not require a full on media room setup with tons of boards...I just did not have that kind of time to deal with the mechanics of repurposing space to support those needs.  On top of that, I needed to be able to train others as a backup.<br/><br/>Because the YoloBox diagram is so poor, I am going to provide some notations from my experience in setting things up:<br/><br/>1. When selecting cameras for pairing with this, make certain they have HDMI output and not just USB.  (I am going to tell you from trials/testing, attempting to use USB only cameras with converters will NOT work successfully.)  The HDMI route provides the true plug and play experience when connecting to the YoloBox.<br/><br/>2. For the video stream from YoloBox to your computer, as a Mac user using USB 3 I relied on the HDMI out port.  I connected this HDMI cable to DIGITNOW's Audio Video Capture Card-4K HDMI, which was then connected to my computer.  Works FANTASTICALLY.<br/><br/>3. For streaming, I do not rely on YoloBox.  I am using my computer for the internet connection functions given the connection as additional camera for YoloBox to the computer.  You will need to connect the equipment to ethernet connection during the initial booting to allow for software updates.  I did not purchase an additional SIM card for use in the device because my focus is on direct connection to Zoom.<br/><br/>4. With connecting to Zoom, the computer recognizes immediately the USB 3.0 link to DIGITNOW's Audio Video Capture Card-4K HDMI converter as another camera.  You simply change your camera setting to the USB connection.  From there, you have all cameras linked to YoloBox displayed within your Zoom session.<br/><br/>5. When using the SD Card, be certain it is a native format for a PC and not a Mac!!!  I use the SD card for storing pictures and jpg versions of the weekly program.  I display this as an overlay during service for those who are connected virtual will know the order of service.<br/><br/>From this point, you refer back to YoloBox for all of the wonderful features you can utilize out-the-box.  The touchscreen feature makes it super easy to do things on the fly, or automatically based on your settings.<br/><br/>As a side note, YoloBox DOES work while plugged in at the same time. I read somewhere where it would not work while plugged in...this is a good thing because I have not noticed an extremely long battery life with the three cameras attached.<br/><br/>Overall, I am pleased after being bummed.  SlingStudio was fantastic in the ability to connect multiple cameras without the cords.  For YoloBox, you just have to be creative in mapping out things that work best for your requirements.</span>

<span>For my entire life I’ve loved photography but have never owned anything more than your average point-n-shoot cameras in the $100-200 range (my last one was a low-end Panasonic Lumix). Or for the past decade I’ve only used the camera on my iPhone. I was lucky to receive a few Amazon gift cards on my recent birthday so I finally bit the bullet and bought this one. And may I just say...wow. I couldn’t be more pleased.<br/><br/>The main thing I’ve always wanted was a camera that could shoot with good depth of field. You know, where the subject being photographed is in sharp focus but the background is blurry, giving the object a more realistic, 3-D look. This camera does that spectacularly, even in fully-automatic, auto-focus mode.<br/><br/>I’ve also always wanted a camera that can take great low-light / night shots. My iPhone camera was actually not bad for day-to-day photos but it took HORRIBLE night shots. The moon, for example, was always nothing more than a blurry blob no matter how still I  stayed. Not so with this camera! The dark shots I’ve taken thus far have all been nice and crisp/clear rather than grainy.  Overall I’m very, very happy with my purchase and I haven’t even used the extra telephoto lens that came with it yet! There is still so much I have yet to learn about its many features so I know it’s only going to get better and better once I learn what all its many options can do.</span>

<span>Very pleasantly surprised. I needed a good quality camera on a budget and this one fits the bill perfectly! I started playing around and shooting after the battery fully charged.

<span>This camera is my first DSLR and it has been an incredible experience shooting in a variety of contexts and formats. I brought this camera on my trip and used the automatic presets for the majority of the trip but started learning from YouTube how to manually adjust each camera setting and realized how powerful this camera can be during photo shoots.<br/><br/>If you’re looking for long range high-depth shots, the lens that comes with this camera will be a let down. I suggest researching lenses before purchasing this camera so you can understand the full scope of costs associated with what you’re looking for as accessories can quickly up the costs. Additionally, consider purchasing a camera bag and definitely purchase an SD card.</span>

<span>Bought thinking it was a neat idea to have a tall tripod for some very specific needs of my business but it might be a novelty. To be honest I was concerned that a tripod so tall would be flimsy or unstable because of what the extension tube length would have to be and it is always hard to tell the quality of something online... Man was I surprised!<br/><br/>This tripod is so stable even fully extended, that I would be confident running a higher end video setup on it with a monitor mounted, etc... I really was impressed.  I am 6'7" anyway, so I will likely use this as my regular tripod in some situations. I am going to place a nice video pan and tilt head on this as it comes with interchangeable plates for both large and small screw mounts and I feel confident that it is sturdy enough that it will stay motionless for pan shots in our videos and action while filming sports. It is also nice that it has a geared neck which gives me a foot+ of motion, and it may even give me enough movement to fake a jib shot as the crank motion seems smooth.<br/><br/>The bag that it comes with is nice and seems durable. The only drawback which actually works to its favor is the weight. I didn't intend to hikie into the woods with this anyway, so not a big deal.<br/><br/>I'll report back once I've had a chance to use it in the field on some commercial shoots and if I get some BTS I'll share them. I'm very happy with the purchase to this point, and it feels like a $500+ tripod for $300 but can serve multiple functions for me and our business. Tall guys do not hesitate!</span>

<span>It's tall and stable, and now will work how I want it to, but there have been a couple of issues.<br/><br/>The first being the leg screws aren't quite tight enough, so the legs wouldn't stay extended. I was on a shoot using it and had to tape the leg to get it to stay long enough to work. I was able to tighten them today, but even a normal socket wrench doesn't fit the hole quite right so it was quite difficult getting them to tighten enough to be stable.<br/><br/>My second issue is the strap. It's proprietary, so has a screw on one end and wraps around the legs on the bottom end. Mine got wet and is now rusty and corroded. The strap is covered in rust too. It's quite gross. I don't have any way to get a replacement. I reached out to the company and they said they didn't have replacement parts available. So I'm probably going to end up DIY'ing a fix to get this thing to work.<br/><br/>So overall, if you can overcome it's difficulties, stable and does a decent job. But it's taking a lot of effort on my part to get a pretty expensive tripod to work correctly.</span>

<span>I was impressed with the quality of this very substantial tripod. It is very solid and achieves heights far above any other tripod that I have used. If you need a 10 foot height, this tripod does it well. In windy conditions, it will benefit from adding leg weights to help stabilize it.</span>

<span>This tripod has a great being unfortunately the construction is cheap. One of the inges for the legs broke within the first week also it it thought to get balanced. If you use this tripod it’s best to set it up in a place where you don’t need to move it too much</span>
