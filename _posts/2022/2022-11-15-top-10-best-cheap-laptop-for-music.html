<span>I'm a Mac guy for the most part.  My main computer is an iMac, but I've always had a Windows laptop for use when travelling etc (too cheap to buy a Macbook....).  My Windows laptop died at a time when I really needed one and I saw this and thought what the heck, I'll give it a try.<br/><br/>I'm very pleased.  For online use, it's absolutely fine.  The screen resolution isn't up to my Mac, but my Windows laptop wasn't either.  I don't really like that I'm logged on to Google (and being tracked) whenever I use it, but I don't do anything online that I'd be ashamed of so I guess that's OK.<br/><br/>It was a little bit tricky to get online for the first time, but that's pretty well documented out on the web, and it was easy to get beyond the issue.  Not really anything to worry about.<br/><br/>The battery life is very good.  Haven't used the camera, so I don't know about that.  But it's lightweight and portable and runs plenty fast.  I think it's a very good value.</span>

<span>I've always owned HP Chromebooks and have been happy, but I don't know what they did to this model's screen. The screen looks muted in color and clarity. Constantly having to adjust so that I can get clearer view.  My older one is much better in this area than this newer model. Too late to return it but will be replacing it soon. I've lost faith in HP and will be going with a different brand of Chromebook in the future.</span>

<span>I’m an elementary school teacher who uses google drive for planning &amp; bought this chromebook to function as my planning tool, for email communication, internet surfing, and to transport back and forth from school/home. I’ve only had it a few days and it’s great!! I never write reviews and I was hesitant to buy because of some of the negative comments about the “tech specs” of this chromebook (idk what they mean anyway). Honestly, it’s great. I can make my slide shows, view videos, and work with all my TPT resources in my drive. Mine was carefully packaged and in perfect condition. It was so easy to plug in and start working! In my opinion- it looks great too! My boyfriend didn’t know I bought it and when he walked in the door and glanced he said “Wait did you get a new MacBook?” Before he saw the “HP” lol! It’s a great little chromebook if you’re looking to do similar day-to-day things for your classroom! I can’t speak to its Zoom capabilities though I haven’t tried it (and hopefully that’s all behind us now).</span>

<span>This is my first Chromebook, and I've been using it for two days.  The battery life is amazing so far; it does appear to be 10 hours. Reading the reviews, it seems like a wide range of experiences, and I feel fortunate that mine works well so far.<br/><br/>It was very easy to set up. I saw 11.5 in the description, but the actual display screen is 10 inches. It isn't a touch screen, and the keys are dark gray, not black. This was an impulse purchase after getting a new laptop a few days ago. My 6 year old Dell would work no longer, and I got an expensive gaming laptop. It was my second one, but I was not expecting it to get so hot, with a noisy fan. The battery life is about an hour. To feel more comfortable, I wanted a Chromebook for email, YouTube, and Amazon videos. So, this is doing what I want it to.<br/>I will likely get more used to having no delete key, instead the alt+backspace key is used for that function.  I was surprised when my bookmark bar appeared with bookmarks from 2013 on. I've deleted many of them in the bookmark manager.<br/>My main dissatisfaction is the disappearing vertical scroll bar. In some emails, you can select "view in<br/>browser". I would be more frustrated if I didn't have the laptop available. There might be a fix for that; I haven't researched yet.<br/>I purchased mine when it was 52% off, which is worth it.  Buying electronics is risky. I've been very disappointed in the past, which is why I'm relieved and accepting of the machine I got.<br/>Almost everything has become more expensive, and reasonable expectations seem to be in order. With two days use, I'm not regretting my purchase.</span>

<span>This Chromebook is dirt cheap and would be great for a student on a budget or someone who just needs to use a few apps and browse the internet.  I use it as a writing laptop, as I don't want to take my expensive, bulky gaming laptop all over the place.<br/><br/>Despite being plastic, it does seem to be solid.  The matte finish is a fingerprint magnet, though it's not a big deal.  The battery life is good, and as far as Chromebook keyboards go, it's fine to type on and better than some I have encountered in the past.<br/><br/>It's fast enough, though it's not zippy and will struggle with heavy apps or opening too many at once.  The screen is also not exactly beautiful and looks very dated.  Still, do you really need a nice screen on a $100 Chromebook?  You also need to be aware that Chromebooks basically have an update expiration date, so before you think you're getting a sweet deal on one, be sure to look up when it will stop receiving updates.  I believe this one is good until 2026 or 2027, which is enough time to get enough bang for your buck.<br/><br/>If you're aware of this Chromebook's limitations, this may be a nice buy.  It suits my needs, and honestly I can't stomach the idea of paying much for a Chromebook in the first place.  I won't feel sick if it gets lost or stolen while I lug it around, but it does what I need it to do well enough.</span>

<span>I am one who will buy a product based on reviews and all of the reviews here were giving this chrome book such high praise, I figured it’d be worth a shot.<br/>What did I need? Something slim, lightweight, easy to transport, something with speed and CHEAP.<br/>I was in desperate need of a new laptop b/c mine is a dinosaur, very clunky and sloooow. Being in school is what really got me looking and trying to save up for a MacBook was never going to happen on my student budget. This little Lenovo chrome book is quick, sleek, and slim. And most of all, only $100. No touch screen but the battery life is incredible. I use it a few hours every day and only have to recharge it every 3-4 days. I use this chrome book for Google docs, internet surfing/research and e-mail. With that being said, I’m not using much storage so I can’t speak to that.<br/>GREAT buy as it was everything I needed for an unbeatable price.</span>

<span>I don't understand all the negative reviews about the screen. It's not the BEST laptop screen I've ever used, but FAR from the worst. And for less than $250? Are you guys kidding me? Are you expecting an ipad pro level screen?<br/><br/>The laptop is solid even though it's plastic, I'm not worried about putting this thing in my backpack. While the keyboard is a little stiff for my taste, it works well. I'm just used to my mechanical keyboard on my desktop. I can write and do some coding perfectly fine and that's how I would describe this chromebook:<br/><br/>Perfectly fine.<br/>Solid.<br/>Reliable.<br/>Lenovo-quality.<br/>I might as well be in one of their commercials, but Lenovo has never failed me.<br/><br/>The negatives?<br/><br/>The screen can be a BIT wobbly when I adjust it, but that's minor. It doesn't wobble when I type, which would make me want to return it. A couple more ports would be nice as well as an SD card slot that allows the SD card to completely insert. This one, the card sticks out halfway.<br/><br/>Battery life is great, can go for hours at the library without needing to be plugged in and I'm using a higher brightness. I'm not doing anything intensive, just chrome tabs, spotify, watching Youtube.<br/><br/>If you need a laptop to take care of your internet needs and basic computer needs, this is a solid one for the price. If you need stronger hardware, then spend at least 400-500. However, if you're already spending that much money, it might be better to get a Windows machine, unless you LOVE Chromebooks.<br/><br/>I love Chrome OS for what it is. Fast, lightweight, and cost-effective. That's the name of the game. If you buy this laptop, or any laptop a this price, then don't expect a thousand-dollar plus experience and then leave horrible reviews. This is a solid chromebook, especially for the price. I'll be keeping this one for a long while and give it to a family member when it's time for me to upgrade.</span>

<span>When I was in college, I was in need of another computer to help with notes and study. I had a nice and expensive computer that did much more than this computer, however, the Chromebook still did a lot of things that any other computer can do and all for a very inexpensive price. My biggest thing that I like about this computer is the price. My nicest laptop was about $2,000, and I love it. However, for families that may not be able to afford such a luxury laptop, this computer did everything I needed it for during college for regularly $279. I notice while I’m writing this review it has went down to $190. For the price, this is a great laptop to do basic work. By no means will this laptop run high quality games or other things that may run the computer too much, but it was great for college activities like writing, studying, and other basic needs. I’m writing this almost two years after purchasing this laptop and the laptop still works great!</span>

<span>I bought an 11.6" Asus back in 2015. Yes it got a slow at a certain point but it maintained! This time round decided for a bit of a bigger screen and happy I made that choice. I've had this 14" notebook now for 4 days and so far it's exactly what I wanted...same as my one before just a bigger screen. And of course way faster since it's new! Highly recommend.

<span>After many years of using actual netbooks, I was in the market for something the same shape and size after they discontinued the term. I wanted something that was somewhat future proof and wouldn't crap out after a few windows updates like all of my previous models.<br/><br/>I saw a video review (it is posted on here and elsewhere) and knew this was the netbook for me. The NVME expansion slot plus the SD card reader made this thing elite compared to other models. I popped a 512GB in here and am able to install old video games, my programs, and even a virtual machine or two.<br/><br/>Windows 10 runs flawlessly on this. Bootup times are a breeze. Program loading times can be a bit slow compared to a much higher end model, but for something as light as this, it is incredible how responsive this little engine that can is.<br/><br/>As everyone will tell you, this thing does not game well. It will play games of yesteryear which is exactly what I bought it for, but of course I tested things like Left4Dead, Tower Unite, and a few others. Left4dead barely runs on here even at lowest settings. Farm Together needs render quality dropped to the bare minimum. I was actually expecting it to run some UT3 engine and Source Engine games at minimal settings, but it failed horribly. I also noticed in the bios, there is not much wiggle room to throw more memory at the GPU and I think that is where is struggles outside of the already known single channel memory flaw. So if you are looking for the casual game of Simcity 2000 or Roller Coast Tycoon, this can handle it, just don't expect to play anything after the 1990s.<br/><br/>I have not made the jump to Windows 11 yet and am a little weary because of the 4GB limitation, but it is constantly reminding me to upgrade so I know that it is fully 11 ready for future proofing.<br/><br/>The numpad seems like a cool idea at first, but I had trouble getting the hang of it and often forget it is even there. I think this is a great feature and may serve a college student who isn't used to traditional trackpads very well. My old self is just so used to a traditional laptop, I need to train myself to utilize it.<br/><br/>I love this netbook and would definitely buy another one if there is an upgraded model in the future when this one starts showing age. I highly recommend it to anyone who wants something small with decent storage and great response times.</span>

<span>When you buy this, just know that you won’t have a lot of internal storage to work with. I bought an sd card to handle my storage effectively. When you get close to having the internal storage met, expect performance issues. The computer will work slower and just seem to struggle with keeping up.<br/><br/>This is NOT a gaming laptop. Please consider buying a different laptop if you wanted to game. It really doesn’t have the frame rate to handle games that are large. I used this laptop to play Roblox with students of mine and 9/10 this laptop could not keep up.<br/><br/>As for a work laptop it’s lightweight and easy to use. I use this laptop for zoom meetings(with an external camera, not the internal one), homework, writing and casual browsing. It does this job well. I generally won’t watch anything on it because the audio quality isn’t great, but if I had to use this laptop I would play the audio with headphones or a speaker.<br/><br/>Overall for school, work, or causal browsing Id definitely recommend this laptop.<br/><br/>PS this is not a backlit keyboard.</span>

<span>Note: This review is for those thinking about run a Linux distribution like Ubuntu.<br/><br/>Ubuntu 21.10 Impish Indri doesnt detect the Realtek wifi adapter that comes with this laptop which is an extremely common problem in the Linux world (in fact, I already know because there were reviews here that said they had to rely on a USB wifi adapter). I tried using a USB Ethernet adapter to connect to the internet and running [apt update/upgrade] hoping that it will install the correct drivers but no luck. However, even [lspci] doesnt event detect the wifi adapter so I just gave up. I bought a generic wifi adapter carrying the latest Intel AX210 for about $40. This new model allows for WiFi 6e and Bluetooth 5.2 connectivity and I tested this on a Windows 10 Pro laptop prior to bringing it over to this Linux machine so I know that the adapter I bought actually delivered these specs. So then I swapped the Realtek with the new Intel wifi adapter and reinstalled the same Ubuntu version. I had wifi even during setup when I was booting the installer from USB. But after installation, only bluetooth was detected. The solution was to [apt update/upgrade] and restart. Then boom now I have wifi and also Bluetooth 5.2 (I didnt include pics but when I ran [hciconfig -a] the version is 5.2) thanks to Intel AX210. I didnt need to manually install other drivers - it just worked after a system update.<br/><br/>Note that you have to disable Secure Boot in the BIOS/UEFI settings for the new wifi adapter hardware to be recognized by the OS. This means that the Secure Boot status should be "Inactive" (or something like that). Delete those stored keys if you need to.<br/><br/>So far, i dont have any issues with it running Ubuntu. The camera, usb ports, and m.2 ssd slots all work fine. I havent used the Bluetooth 5.2 though since no need for it. Also, doing basic computer stuff like web browsing and word processing is not lightning fast but also not slow. It takes a few seconds to open Firefox but watching 1080p videos is no problem. I tried running 1 Lububtu virtual machine and I didnt have any problems, but it is kinda slow - though tolerable.</span>

<span>I had a previous version of this laptop before so after four years I decided to get a replacement and gift my old one to a friend.  The laptop works great just like the last one.  It's perfect for basic work like office suites and surfing the web,  It is lightweight and I take it with me when living abroad.  The only issue I have with it is that even though I have the power management set to shut entirely down with either the lid closed or pressing the power button, The battery isn't holding the charge.  I can fully charge it, shut down and unplug it; in about three days, it will be about 35 percent battery life.  However, I don't know if its MS 11 or the Hardware itself.  Other than that, I love the Asus product line and this little laptop. Just don't expect it to be fully charged if you leave it unplugged after a few days.</span>

<span>For the money I am completely satisfied with my purchase.

<span>OK, this is my second Stream.  The original was a 32GB that is still operating and is obviously limited by the couple GB remaining after the operating system space.  However, was useful for web browsing.  This one is 64GB and that leaves about 30GB space for programs plus one year of MS Office free.  I got rid of the Windows 10 S mode and the speed for web browsing and program operation is fine.  And I'm used to an Intel 11th generation i5 on a desktop and have no complaints. That is an absolutely amazing unit for $200.  Of course, in both cases, I've added extra room using a USB 128GB flash drive so really, it's a fantastic deal.  The only con that I've found so far is that the sound is rather puny but connecting a cheap bluetooth speaker solves that issue.  Update:  I hooked this up to an external monitor and it gave me an option to go from the native internal screen resolution of 1366x768 to 1920 x 1080 and it shows up great on the external monitor.  I'm shocked.  I cannot believe this computer was $200.  Well, we'll see how long it lasts.</span>

<span>I needed a laptop with a decent battery life, and room for upgrade. Mostly for office work and media consumption. Web surfing needed, strong wifi, I wanted S mode for security. I wanted access to office.com for document use. I wanted decent audio too. The laptop I got provided all of that. The audio at 100 percent was adequate for media, but my Bluetooth speaker works better. I can still hear it fine without the Bluetooth. I charged the laptop to 100 percent and watched a series, I like, for three hours before it reached 50 percent. So, for media consumption at full brightness gave me plenty of battery. I think I could get a total of five- or six-hours watching movies. I charged it back up from 50 percent to 100 percent in two hours while I watched more series episodes. I keep the touch pad turned off all the time. I never use it, because I prefer a wireless mouse. The laptop is about the size of my 14-inch Chromebook. This laptop, however, is more powerful. So far, I am pleased with this purchase. This would not be suitable for gaming or video editing, but I use my desktop for those things. I recommend this laptop for the things I've mentioned and the low price. The laptop I bought has the following specs.<br/>Acer Aspire 5 A515-56-32DK Slim Laptop was delivered in two days.

<span>So we just got this laptop a couple days ago, and I'll update things as they go along. Firstly it's a pretty decent laptop for the money, trying to read reviews on it is a pretty mixed basket because they have so many other cheap/er laptops that most of the reviews are not for this one. So you'll have to pay attention to the model number they are reviewing. (Acer Aspire 5 A515-56-702V)<br/>Here's a couple of my deciding points which lead to the purchase:<br/><br/>- Aluminum case (not super thick but still not plastic) has a more sturdy feel to it (within reason as this is not a $2K laptop).<br/><br/>- Solid Intel i7 Processor, first came to market Sep 2020. Good sized cache.<br/><br/>- It has a 512GB NVMe SSD drive in it which is the M.2 format, these are some of the fastest drives out right now as far as standards go. Most laptops with SSD are taking about the SATA drives, which while fast, are not anywhere close to the M.2 speeds.<br/><br/>- Being that it's an M.2 drive this leaves an entire drive bay empty in the laptop for future storage upgrade (SATA) if needed or having an alternate backup drive right in the laptop etc. (i.e. expandable in the future if you need it)<br/><br/>- It has 16GB of memory, I'm not sure why so many laptops out there only have 8GB, just running basic windows will eat at least 5GB+ of memory which doesn't leave a lot left for everything else. (In my humble opinion) and I appreciated the ability to upgrade that further in the future if needed to 24GB.<br/><br/>- It has plenty of USB ports and HDMI out for conference rooms/TV's etc.<br/><br/>Some of the cons:<br/>- The power adapter is a very small "pin" power adapter. Needless to say this was rather disappointing because we all know that sometimes cords get pulled or bumped etc. And it's likely to damage the internals because it's very small. I would have liked to see one of the thicker power adapter connections just for strength.<br/>- Windows 11 - Personally I'm not a huge fan thus far but mainly just for functionality reasons like you can't ungroup open programs on the task bar, it's one icon and that's it with no ability to change it. It's not a tablet it's a computer.<br/>- No Thunderbolt Port<br/>- No option to charge via USB C (which would negate the very tiny pin adapter)<br/><br/>So we did run into a couple issues. We had a problem with the laptop not seeing the power cord plugged in, it would blink as if it was going to start working (windows battery page in settings) then act like it was never plugged in. We reached out to Acer and they had us reset the battery via a paperclip and pin hole on the bottom. It's worked find so far after that. Getting a tech on the online chat via Acer support was fast and he was able to quickly resolve the issue.<br/><br/>So generally, this being my very first Acer Laptop, I'm pleased with things so far. We'll see how it holds up in the long run.</span>

<span>I got this for my elderly mother-in-law who uses a computer almost exclusively for emailing. So she doesn’t need a whole lot of memory; 4/64 gigs is plenty of memory. At this price point, it’s a surprisingly attractive and solidly made laptop—comparable in initial quality, fit/finish to a MacBook. By far the worst aspect of this unit is the inclusion of Windows ‘S’ mode. The ‘S’ stands for safety; I have another word in mind! I won’t go into the ugly details here; half of the other reviews will do that. Suffice it to say that I opted out of ‘S’ mode, despite the possible risks/downsides. Many have complained about the keyboard; I see no problem with it whatsoever. Other than the ‘S’ mode issue, the laptop itself may just be the best inexpensive PC I’ve encountered.</span>
