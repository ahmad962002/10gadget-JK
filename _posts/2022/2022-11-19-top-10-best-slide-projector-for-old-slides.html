If your projector has a focus motor in it, then this is the kit for you. If your projector does NOT have a focus motor, please order: Link & Rivet Set for Pre-1981 Kodak Carousel Slide Projector. The most common cause for the failure of the slide tray to advance or reverse is the breakage of this small Link (part 217769). It fits on the end of the solenoid actuator arm and is held in place by a Rivet (part 159943). The replacement of this part does not take a rocket scientist; however, a moderate mechanical aptitude skill is required. You will also find that the focus motor gear (part FM-GEAR) and the gear next to the focus motor gear (part 167348). It is best to remove the old gears BEFORE replacing the link then replacing them after the link has been installed. This Kit contains 1 Link, 1 Rivet, 1 Focus Motor Gear and 1 Gear Next to Focus Motor Gear.

<span>Technician told all good. Only thing is they tell u to tap the gear on the way they tell you u can potentially drive the pin through the other side if u are not careful.😰</span>

<span>Overall a great and inexpensive way to keep your projector alive. There should be better instructions when it comes to the autofocus drive gears. It would be most helpful if there was an indication as to how far the gear should be driven down on its pin and then to what degree the focus gears should mesh for proper operation. You are left in the dark as far as this goes and this was the only issue that still is not functioning properly due to lack of instruction. This is a very important feature as far as I am concerned and I do not have it due to less than clear instruction.</span>

<span>I repaired my Kodak slide projector. My husband did not hold out much hope that I would be successful.  I had researched the problem and felt confident this was the correct repair.  I will say you need patience and watch the video. Keep track of the screws and parts you remove. Do not rush.  I could not believe it when reassembled my projector worked like new!  Thank you!!</span>

<span>Going through Mom's storage locker a few weeks ago, we came across the venerable Kodak slide projector and carousels. Trouble is, the old projector didn't have a bulb.  New bulbs for this particular model are close to $40 each.  For $20, I found a newer version (650H) on Craigslist that uses cheaper (and easier to replace) halogen bulbs.  BUT, it suffered the same problem we all are seeking to address.  The carousel wouldn't advance or reverse.  After reading the reviews here stating that there are no instructions, I sought guidance from YouTube, then ordered the kit along with a few extra.  This is not a highly skilled repair, just one that takes patience and a few special tools.  *****NOTE***** Contrary to some reviewer's claims that there are no instructions included, they are!  If you are seeking clear visuals, realize that this part is buried deep in the bowels of the projector, so even though the instructions are precise, some images require study to properly register the vantage point that matches your projector.  The suggestion to use hemostats is good, though I didn't use them.  A good long pair of tweezers will suffice, particularly if you use some thin self-stick foam on the jaws to increase the tweezer's grip (stick the foam onto the jaws).  Also, the solenoid replacement worked better for me when I inserted the tweezers via the lens compartment after carefully removing the glass.  Included in the instructions is a good "while we're in here, lets perform some maintenance" instructions.  As long as you got the hood up, you may as well lube everything.  My only complaint has nothing to do with the product or the seller, but rather the postal delivery.  They were challenged to deliver the very thin, envelope-like package along with my regular mail.  Go figure.  All in all, my wife and I are planning a "movie (slide) night" so my family can come over and relive 50+ year old memories.  Thanks guys!</span>

The Kodak Carousel projector gives you sharp, bright images and quiet, dependable operation. It accepts 2-by-2-inch slides in either 80- or 140- slide trays. Its safety thermal fuses protect the projector from overheating while the slide prewarmer prevents the slides from "popping." The carousel tray allows you to load slides quickly and gives you access to all slides at all times

<span>I am a child of the 1950's.  Everyone in my family and in particular my Grandfather used Ektachrome for slides.  When I went away to college I studied Art and the fundamental method of conveying images was through slides.  it was "standard operating procedure" for a long time.  I have a Kodak Carousel slide projector still in use.  I took slides of everything because Ektachrome was always in my Pentax Spotmatic F.  I have accumulate a great many slides after almost 70 years but many of them have not been seen in a very long time.  That is until now.  I do not have a place to set up a projector and I have for a long time needed a way to achive this recorded history.  I did the search here and discovered this unit from Kodak.  I read reviews and have learned to toss the demonstrably bad ones from those with axes to grind (2 ** for no SD card included) .  I bought this and fell in love with it right out of the box.  It is very easy to set up and use with very little reference to the manual.  I am one of those people who don't like using manuals.  There were a few things like learning the clock is not designed to be continuous but just a date stamp that knowing in the beginning saved some frustration but for the most part the buttons on the top will explain themselves.  I have had a box of slides slides floating around since moving in to my present location that had separated themselves from the bulk of those that I have stored.  I have wanted to see what this box contained but it is not that easy to hold them up to the light and see all of the detail.  So with new Kodak unit now plugged into the USB port of my iMac I headed into the unknown.  With the unit powered on and a quick glance at the manual to see which button to push for review i was away down memory lane.  I was initially only going to look at a couple of images to see how the images looked on the 5 inch screen.  But i soon was so captured by the quality of what i was seeing that i went went one slide after another until every one of almost 200 slides had been recorded.  I owned several slide viewers in the late 80's and early to mid 90's and they were always problematic to use.  They were just small projection boxes whose lamps always generated a great deal of heat and were rather cumbersome to use and store.  And they were only viewers with not means of recording images.  This Kodak unit has solved everything for me.  It is small enough that it sits comfortably amongst my other pieces on my desktop and yet large enough to easily see the screen.  It is also very stable and will rest comfortably wherever it is placed.  This unit has for me been the answer for everything that i have needed.  Now I have a reason to excavate my Grandfather's old slides a relive the Christmas gatherings when everyone was still around.  I whole heartedly recommend this Kodak viewer/recorder to anyone with similar needs.</span>

<span>I have been using many different tools to transfer film to a digital format, this has been the best. It is the easiest to use, comes with the different slides sizes, and does a good job. There is one downfall to this and that is when using film that has been sitting a long time therefore is bent. It will try to fall out as you go through the negatives on that piece. Simple remedy for this: use a notebook or a book on the exit side to keep the film from falling down and it does not try to escape and does not give you skewed images because of it. With that being the only issue I have had with it, it has truly simplified the process for me.</span>

<blockquote><em><div class="a-row a-spacing-small review-data"><span class="a-size-base review-text review-text-content" data-hook="review-body">
<span>I purchased this about two months ago. I own two other high end film scanners that I use to get quality scans of some of my slides for various projects. I have always wanted to scan all of my slides and negatives, but the scanners I own take two (2) to four (4) minutes to scan each slide, in addition to the time it takes to clean the slides prior to scanning. This scanner takes about four (4) seconds per scan. I read a lot of the reviews about this scanner with interest. I was concerned with reviews expressing concerns about:<br/>1) Image quality.<br/>2) Ease of use.<br/>I decided I would try this scanner and in the worst case scenario it would let me quickly see the approximately 4000 slides in my collection that I have not seen in 40 plus years and allow me to determine which of my slides I would need to re-scan with one of my high end scanners if any.<br/>This review only address how this scanner handles slides. The one thing I liked most about it is that the lens in the camera offers a good depth of field and the images are sharp corner to corner even if the film is warped. If your slides are well exposed it produces good scans and the scanner allows coarse exposure and color corrections for poorly exposed slides. Many reviewers complained that these adjustments were too coarse, I found that they allowed rough corrections for old faded and discolored film which makes further adjustments in software editing packages easier. I found that I was able to scan most rolls of film without tinkering with these adjustments once I had corrected my first slide on that roll of film. You will need a can of compressed air or a little blower to keep the flat light source free of dust which if not cleaned will make spots on your scans. An anti-static brush is also helpful.<br/>Below I will address the three areas of concerns I was worried about:<br/><br/>1) Image quality.<br/>The one area that I wish Kodak would change is the file compression setting that the scanner uses on it’s files. This unit uses a 14 mega-pixel camera with the option to up sample to 22 MB Using the 14 MB setting the image files are only about 1.5 MB, using the 22 MB setting produces files about 4.3 MB. This indicates a very high degree of compression! I wish they offered options to adjust it. This is too much compression! I was fairly certain that my images would need some post-scan color correction. After a short period of testing I felt I saw a slight improvement in image quality from the 22 MB images vs the 14 MB images after post-scan color correction. I set the unit to the 22MB setting and I have ran all of my files through a batch file color correction in Photoshop Elements. To get files from this scanner to approach the output from my high end scanners I have to spend time in Photoshop manually correcting the output from this scanner. But 4 minutes vs 4 seconds and in the end I will most likely only need to re-scan maybe 1% to 2% of my slides, so yes this scanner offers a lot of bang for the buck!<br/><br/>2) Ease of use.<br/>It comes with two slide adapters. One for thick plastic mounts and one for the thin cardboard mounts. Both of these adapters are designed so you can quickly push the slides through the scanner. I used the adapter for the thick on just a few of my slides, it work good for plastic mounted slides. The adapter for the thin cardboard mounts has a problem in that if the slide mounts are bent they will catch on the plastic frame on the discharge side of the slide exposure opening where the light passes through the slides so they can be scanned. To fix this I took a small jewelers file and tapered the top and bottom edges of the plastic frame on that side of adapter enabling  me to push many of my bent slides through the adapter without catching.  I had to bevel a little less than 1/16" of the plastic to get it to work and I still had a just few slides that hung up on this edge. However it is fairly easy to slide the adapter out of the scanner and then push the offending slide mount up or down while pushing the next side into the adapter which will push the offending slide past the catch point. Once the offending slide is no longer caught on the frame you can re-insert the adapter into the scanner and finish pushing your slides through the scanner. Thankfully the adapter is plastic and filing it down was easy.</span>

<span>I inherited my father's voluminous collection of color 35mm slides which sat in the basement for 70 years. Reaching back to the early 1950's only a few years after my father returned from the war, he took up photography in the Army as part of the Signal Corps and then continued informally when he returned home. The problem? I have no slide projector to see any of these, and never really relished the idea of purchasing one (I do all my photography in digital). Thus, these pictures, with all the memories they hold, have stayed in the dark without anyone seeing them.<br/><br/>That's where this handy little device comes in. I wanted to easily digitize these slides so at the very least I could look them over, and possibly even find some gems that I could print and share. The thought of the work involved in doing such a task kept me off from doing it for two decades until I ran into this little Kodak device. Yes, it still takes time, and will indeed take time, but once you learn how to do it, you can rip through slide digitization at a pretty good clip.<br/><br/>You plug the device in, hinge the screen so it is at the correct angle for viewing, and pop in an SDXC card into the back slot. Turn it on, set a couple of quick settings to tell the machine what type of media you are using (35mm slides, film negatives, etc.) and you are ready to go. The unit comes with a number of plastic holders that you slip into the side of the unit and then you simply slide your slides or negatives into the device. When the image shows up on the screen correctly centered, you press one button and either a 14 or 22mp screen capture (depending on your settings) is made and automatically stored on the SDXC card. You just continue this process until you are finished or are ready for a break, etc.<br/><br/>The image scan is pretty good and while I would not pretend to say this is a high-end professional scanner, it does a more than adequate job for tasks like I've described above. There are adjustments for color, sharpness, etc. if you wish to make them. The real benefit to this unit is the ease in which it allows you to conduct the conversion process, turning an unpleasant and lengthy task into something much easier. When you are done, you simply eject the SDXC card and insert it into your computer and copy off the scans. From there you can use any photo editing software to adjust the image (images are saved as jpg files).<br/><br/>The quality of the device itself seems good and sturdy, and I don't expect to see any problems with its use over time. The unit makes no noise and does not seem to get warm during use (probably uses an LCD-based light for scanning) and looks nice enough that you can leave it off on the back of a shelf without it looking obnoxious.<br/><br/>I'm glad I found the device and can easily give it five stars!<br/><br/>Note: If you are in a situation like me, your slides or negatives will be dusty and dirty from years of sitting around. Do some online research on the correct way to clean slides and negatives because you will want to clean these before you scan. If you scan the slides in a dirty condition, all the dirt and dust will show up on your photos.</span>

<span>I did a fair bit of experimenting with this over a couple of days. First, let's note a few things.<br/><br/>1) This is not a Kodak product. Whoever is making this is merely licensing the Kodak name.<br/><br/>2) This is NOT a scanner. It projects an image of your slide or negative and takes a digital photo of it.<br/><br/>3) This has both 14MB and 22MB resolution. But the 22MB resolution is merely a software rescaling of the 14MB version, and doesn't do anything for the quality.<br/><br/>4) Once you get used to the menus and controls, the unit is fairly easy to set up.<br/><br/>5) The user manual is all but worthless. It is thick, so you think at first sight that is fairly extensive, but it is not. What you have is 27 pages in English (of which 2 are introductory material and 4 are warranty information, and the remainder of the manual is the French, German, Italian, and Spanish versions of that. There is NO description of any of the cables included. You'll learn more by simply playing around with it than you ever will by reading the manual.<br/><br/>6) Others have said that you have to removed the 35MM slide holder every time you want to scan a new slide. My experience is that you can simply push in a new slide from the right, and it will push out the current slide. The 35MM slide holder will hold two slides at the end, so you will need to remove it to get the last two slides out.<br/><br/>7) The 35MM negative holder is not well designed. You can insert a negative strip from the right, but it hangs up on the left side where the film strip is supposed to exit. So you have to pull the negative carrier out, insert the negative manually into the exit on the left, close the carrier, reinsert it, scan pictures 2-5, and then pull the negative strip all the way to the right to get a shot of the first picture on the negative strip. This also requires you to remove the negative carrier each time, which is another opportunity for dust to enter the scanner.<br/><br/>8) To get a clean "scan" you have to remove all dust from the bottom of the device. A tool is included for doing that, but it does not work well. It tends to just move the dust around, rather than remove it. If there is a way to clean the duster tool, I couldn't figure it out, and the manual is silent about it. The manual does warn against using any sort of compressed air, which only makes sense, since you are likely to just blow dust further into the device. To top it off, the soft, feltlike portion of the cleaning want came loose after about 5 uses.<br/><br/>9) The power cord is short—less than 1 meter. If you don't use an extension cord, you will be doing all of your scans sitting on the floor up against the wall.<br/><br/>10) As others have pointed out, there are no instructions for how to hook this up to your television. I did not try this, but if you are technically proficient, you can probably figure this out. On the other hand, if your VCR just blinks 12:00 all day, you'll probably need some assistance.<br/><br/>11) All of the slide and film carriers feel cheaply made. I can't open or close one without feeling like I'm going to break it. If you buy this to scan some 35MM slides and you break the slide holder, it's now a paperweight, since there is no mention of where to buy replacement holders.<br/><br/>12) Despite trying for 3 hours, I cannot get this to scan 8MM film. (This does not convert 8MM film to a movie file; rather, it will allow you to capture individual frames as still images.) No matter how I inserted the film or adjusted the settings, I could not get an even remotely clear image of an 8MM film frame. This was a major disappointment.<br/><br/>Because of all the issues I've mentioned above, I returned this device. I have thousands of slides and negative to scan. This unit is simply not for me. The quality is not great enough to print 8x10 or larger enlargements.<br/><br/>If you are more concerned with preserving memories, rather than quality, this unit will probably work for you. If you want to make some 3x5 or 4x6 prints, you can probably achieve that. If you have plenty of time, this unit will work for you.<br/><br/>But if you need quality scans that are actual scans, this will not work for you. If you want to print quality enlargements, this is not the unit for you. If you want to scan a large number of slides and negatives, this unit is too slow for that.</span>

<span>I have scanned several hundred slides since I bought this scanner. The ability to adjust color before scanning to the SD card is nice. The quality of the images seems fine but I have not used any other brands of scanners for comparison. It would be nice to be able to scan directly to my computer in real time but I don't know if any scanners do that. I don't know if there is a way to set the date code properly on the images. All my images are time stamped 2017. The instruction manual is in several languages but the English instructions are rudimentary and not very helpful. I also needed a magnifying glass to read the instructions. I have had to use a spatula from the kitchen to remove a couple of warped slides from the scanners tray after they got stuck. It is also helpful to keep a spray can of compressed air on hand. Cardboard slides can leave particles behind that interfere with the appearance of the images. Aligning the slide on the tray can be tricky until you get the hang of it. It should be obvious from the picture of the scanner that it only scans one slide at a time. The scanner gets the job done and seems to cost less than some others on the market.</span>

<span>OK, folks, here's the deal. This scanner functions very well for its intended purpose. It creates files that are perfectly suitable for posting online, sharing via email, and printing at relatively small sizes. 8 x 10 would be pushing it. I see that Amazon is selling much cheaper units that appear to have the same specs. I paid extra for, frankly, the Kodak brand, should I need customer support (not so far).<br/><br/>Pluses: it's quick to use; you can digitize quite a few negatives or slides in a relatively short time. The files are adequate for online posting and small prints.<br/><br/>Minuses: it doesn't clean up dirty, scratched, or dusty source material. You really need external editing software to produce adequate images. I use Lightroom, which is excellent for correcting the color casts that appear on many scans, removing dust spots and scratches, and dialing back the over-saturation on many images. There's a lot of editing software out there that can do the same. Don't expect exhibition quality prints. However, I've attached a scan which came out quite well, and shows the resolution and color capability of the unit. I would expect that I could make a decent 5" x 7" print from this file.<br/><br/>Do not use the 22 MB file size. It gives you no more detail, and if you need to up-res your file for printing, your editing software will do a much better job. If you scan something, and think, "Wow, that's a great slide/negative. I'd like to make an 11" x 14 print from it," then stop there and either send the slide/neg to ScanCafe or a similar service, or purchase an Epson V600, which will yield a much higher quality scan. But I've sent a number of scans of old negatives to folks pictured in them, and they've asked for larger file size copies from which they can make prints, so the quality is still pretty good.<br/><br/>Bottom line: if you have realistic expectations and are willing to spend a little time in editing software (don't bother with the unit's editing controls), you will be quite happy with the results.</span>

<span>Scanner easy to use and works well.  Internal memory holds about 21 slides before you have to upload them to your computer and clear the memory.  It scanned about a third of the slides a bit dark, so I had to use a program to adjust the brightness/contrast.  Compared to the flatbed scanner I had first tried to use, this was so much faster and easier. If you have a lot of slides to digitize I would recommend this scanner.</span>

<span>My particular projector - an old Kodak 750H needed this part to advance the slide trays.  I had the full kit with the gears from another vendor, but the link in that kit was too thick to fit the bracket on the solenoid.  This link fit.  So I combined the gears from the other kit with this link and fixed the projector.  Note this is NOT a particularly easy fix in that the screws are small and hard to access, there isn't much clearance in which to work, the solenoid mounting plate bushings interfere with its removal and replacement, and lining up the screw holes in the solenoid with those in the solenoid mounting plate is tedious.  In addition the solenoid mounting plate needs to be set to the proper depth in the rest of the frame.  I measured the distance it protruded above the frame with a dial caliper (.075 inches) and made sure it was the same distance before I tightened the solenoid mounting plate adjusting screw. The instructions recommend a long shaft 1/4 inch nut driver, and this is a good thing to have.  I also had a 1/4 inch combination wrench that was handy for loosening some of the very tight screws.  It took me several hours.</span>

<span>My mom passed away about 5 years ago and my dad has taken it so hard that he threw out all the family photos so he wouldn’t be reminded of her.  Luckily, he found the negatives, so I’ve been digitizing them.<br/>At first, I just wanted to get started right away and didn’t want to spend much money, so I went ahead and ordered the Kodak Mobile Film Scanner for $39.  It was the cheapest one out there.  With further investigating, I decided it probably wouldn’t be the best solution if I wanted to have good quality.  I had looked up on youtube how to make your own scanner using your phone, glass from picture frames, a tablet (for the light), a box, and some tuna cans.  I downloaded the Kodak app and tried it out.  The quality was terrible!  So I figured the Kodak Mobile Film Scanner would be about the same.<br/>Just as the other reviews state, it is a simple design made of a hard cardboard-type material.  You turn it on (batteries not included), place your negative on top of the light, and place your mobile phone so that the camera lens is over the hole.  It matters little how good your camera works--it is still blurry and poor quality.  My phone is an iphone X, which has a great camera—one of the best.  I think mainly because you are taking a photo of something so small and expect it to be larger and clearer.  I got the same result by using the home-made scanner.<br/><br/>Pros:<br/>•Less expensive than other scanners, but still not worth the price.  I agree with other reviewers that have said it’s only worth about $10, not $50.<br/>•Good for if you just want to see what a negative is, but not good enough quality to print a photo.<br/><br/>Cons:<br/>•Does not produce good quality photos.<br/>•Way over priced.<br/><br/>I included some photos for the review that show the difference in quality using the Kodak scanner, and another one, and also different size of negatives.  Keep in mind, these negatives are old and of poor quality to begin with.</span>

<span>I purchased to digitalize a bunch of old home slides. The unit was easy to set up and use. I found that my iphone camera did a better job than the app software (for slides). The only issue I had was that some of my old slides were "over-sized" and too large for the background light. For these, I had to position the slide to capture the most relevant part of the slide. Overall, the unit was worth the money to convert these slides.</span>

<span>So at first I thought wow this is really cheap quality but then I thought about how expensive other ones are and realized they found an inexpensive way to accomplish the same thing! It is made out of a heavy duty cardboard like material but works really well and if not abused it seems like it will last. It needs 2 AA batteries that you will put in the bottom part so that it can backlight the negative. You will also need to download the Kodak app for your phone, at first I was like ugh I hate Kodak apps and programs but this one is actually really nice and it is user friendly! I was even able to use it on an oversized negative but the backlight only illuminates the area of a 35mm negative, which the area I was trying to capture was about that size. It works with color negatives, color positives, and black and white negatives. I havent tried it yet with any other sized negative but I do have some 110 negatives that I might try with it. If the negative is smaller than 35mm it might be possible! Overall I am very pleased with this purchase and highly recommend it but dont be expecting a heavy duty item, it would be nice if made out of some plastic type material but that would just drive up the cost.</span>
