<span>This Tablet was on my radar for a few months before this version was released. I really, really like it so far. I have had it for a few months and I primarily use it for apps like Crunchyroll, Manta, and webtoon. The sound quality from the speakers are great, the screen quality is great, and it's capable of playing most games without issue.<br/><br/>The ONLY problem I have is the Bluetooth. I cannot watch one episode of anything without whatever device I'm bluetoothing for sound getting disconnected. Happens every 15 minutes or so on average, so most of the time I just use wired earbuds anymore or cast to tv. Yes, I have tried both Bluetooth headsets I have, and 2 different sound systems. It disconnected from all of them in the same intervals, so it is an issue with the tablet no doubt. IF I didn't encounter this Bluetooth issue, this would have been 5 out of 5 hands down.</span>

<span>I like all 3. The quality of the photos and videos this tab takes. The battery last longer than other tabs. I like that it's touch screen, but also that it has a pen I can use. I also like that it's easy to transfer my videos and pictures with the USB cord to my desktop computer. The only thing I don't like is the price. But it's still woth it. I also bought a screen cover. You can't go wrong with this tablet.</span>

<span>I had previously gotten a cheap tablet, it had several "small issues" at first (randomly restarted almost daily, battery life was poor despite the indicator saying otherwise, games would randomly crash). After two years, it became almost unusable. It would shut off after about 15 minutes if not connected to power (despite battery indicator saying 90 percent). After this experience, I decided to not be cheap and spend more money on a good tablet. I found this model and I have seen almost no issues since I bought it back in March. Battery life is excellent. Have not seen any random restarts.  The games that would frequently crash on the old device are now working flawlessly.  I did get a warranty just in case this device would fail. However so far so good. It has been worth the extra money that I spent on it.</span>

<span>I cannot brag about this tablet enough! I've used it non stop since I got it about a month ago. Currently actually! Lol. Battery is awesome! I play games, browse internet and watch YouTube for hours on this thing. I usually don't even have to charge it everyday! Definitely worth the money.</span>

<span>Surprisingly heavy, yet clear screen and so far, battery life.  Contrast and brightness doesn't quite keep up with bright sun, though adequate.  All around good value for name brand tab of this size.  Plenty responsive and good speakers.</span>

<span>I bought the 32 GB internal storage and 3 GB RAM version, which is the cheapest model due to it being on sale. If this will be your go-to, main tablet then I would suggest upgrading to a version with more RAM and internal storage. Others say the 64 GB internal storage doesn't experience any studder performance with the device.  This 32 GB internal storage (3 GB RAM) studders through swipes and many other operations. I am still going to keep it though, because I only have a few purpose for this device.  Sufficient to use for reading books, but just make sure it's not under the bright sun. It allows me to watch YouTube TV, YouTube, Netflix, HBO Max, just fine, but I tell you I come from owning an old IPAD Air that does not even qualify for the latest IOS update today.  That IPAD is just as smooth if not smoother than this tablet, however due to the IOS (12.x) being outdated, it cannot run many applications. This Samsung SM-x200 A8 tablet can run all the applications that I want to use today. Here are the PROs and CONs from my perspective:<br/><br/>PRO:<br/>- Newer device that runs most application today that I use.<br/>- External MicroSD card feature.<br/>- Cheap price, waaaaay cheaper than Apple Ipads.<br/><br/>CON:<br/>- Studders with 32 GB internal storage and 3 GB RAM.<br/>- Screen brightness not that bright, but useable. Glossy screen reflects under the sun so probably not that great outdoors.<br/><br/>Summary - Battery life is OK, I think it isn't that impressive but up to 8 hours+ of usage is not terrible. Upgrade to the higher internal storage/memory model versions to avoid studdering I guess, other reviewers say the tablet is better with more internal storage.  I believe with higher amount of internal storage, Samsung also increases the RAM to 4 GB RAM, but I'd double check before you buy on that information. The software applications installs on the internal storage, and I have not been able to figure out if they can be installed on the external MicroSD card.  On the other hand, you CAN move the data many or most of the "data" that the installed applications use to the external MicroSD card. Speakers are loud and clear, really like it. The WIFI connection is okay, but I bet overall tablet performance would be WAY better if there was slightly more RAM internally (3 GB vs 4 GB). This tablet supposedly is compatible with up to 1 TB of external MicroSD storage, and I have one on order that's arriving soon.  If is not compatible with the 1 TB MicroSD card, I will update my review and mention it, but I do not anticipate any problems.<br/><br/>I do not use this tablet as my main source of electronic device though (I prefer my higher performance laptop), so this is why I will keep it even though I think the performance for this lower-tier performance device is a bit lacking. It works very well for watching streaming services, reading books and minor browsing. If you are okay with the studdering performance here and there, then this is an inexpensive product to have on a budget. It connects to my home network NAS just fine, I can plug in the USB-C power cord and let it stream news all day, no issues (for now). I'm sure after a few years this tablet will be obsolete just like my Ipad Air has become, but it will have served its purpose.</span>

<span>Got a solid deal on this Galaxy tablet from Amazon. I bought this tablet mainly to control the apps for my audio system because using my iPhone or Surface ties those devices up and if I walk out the room with them Tidal and other apps will quit streaming.<br/><br/>Here’s what I like -<br/><br/>- Easy set up<br/>- clear screen<br/>- thin and lightweight<br/>- works great for all audio apps including Amazon Music, Tidal music streaming, SVS subwoofer control app, Sony headphone app, HEOS for Denon, BluOs for my BluOs Node 2i, and Audacy to name a few.<br/>-USB C connector - none of the annoying Apple lightning connector nonsense and expense. I think Apple is being forced to change the lightning connector in 2023 thanks to the European Union ruling.<br/><br/>What I don’t like<br/>-wish the battery were more robust. It seems to need charging more than I thought it would. It helps to close out all back ground apps when powering the tablet off.<br/>- Slippery case - I added a protective case<br/>- a little annoying to type on because the typing screen is not large. I have a Bluetooth keyboard for longer typing sessions<br/><br/>Overall, this is a slick tablet and it’s got exactly what I need for my audio system and the odd foray into the web. Hope that helps!</span>

<span>The Samsung A8 is near bottom of the Samsung line up of tablets.  It comes in two memory sizes, 3gb and 4gb versions starting at 64gb of storage.  Let me start by saying, there is no reason whatsoever to buy the 32gb variant as it comes with only 3gb of physical ram.  That extra gig of ram is what makes this tablet worth the money.  I only recommend the 4gb variant, and find the 64gb storage model is really the sweet spot with this tablet.  So let's get into the review.<br/><br/>The first thing I noticed is the weight.  It is a heavy tablet.  This is not a deterrent to me as I do most of my gaming using an Xbox controller (bluetooth) so I am not holding onto the tablet for long periods of time.  This is good because the weight of it becomes cumbersome very quickly.  The 10.5" screen is good, not great, but good.  The tablet resolution, while not fantastic does allow HD playback on netflix.  This is a nice touch.  There is however, a one inch bezel round the screen.  This makes the tablet look dated, as the era of large bezels is well beyond us.  The only good thing about such large bezels is it gives the user a place to put their fingers when holding onto the tablet.  The screen is quite bright, although the glossy surface does make use in bright environments difficult.  My biggest issue with the screen is that it does not brighten or darken well when there is a change of lighting environment.  This is a feature we have become used to, so it feels like a real miss in terms of ease of use.<br/><br/>There are four speakers on this tablet on top and bottom (portrait mode) and they get quite loud.  Don't expect audiophile quality here, but they do the trick, and were able to create a wide soundstage when watching a movie.  I would recommend the use of a quality earphone solution.  I use QE2 monitor headphones and the sound was much better.  There is no EQ baked into the OS, which is a letdown.<br/><br/>There are few buttons on the side, a volume rocker, power switch and an earphone jack as well as USB C charging.  It does support Bluetooth, which is good.  I was able to have music playing on the tablet, and wash dishes in the kitchen while the tablet remained in the living room without any loss in signal.  I also used it at the laundromat, with the tablet in a backpack, and was able to stay connected.  One thing that is missing with the Bluetooth is hearing aid compatibility.  While I can download the hearing aid app, connecting my aids to the tablet is another thing.  Most hearing aid connections are established through the accessibility options in settings, however, Samsung chose not to include any hearing aid connections in their accessibility options.  This is a huge miss.  Those of us who are reliant upon hearing aids will find their experience reduced as a result.  Considering this connection is just a software fix, not having it is a huge middle finger to the deaf community.  Shame on you Samsung.  The battery life is okay, but when connected to a 30 watt charger, it did recharge quite quickly.  Unfortunately it comes with a very low wattage wall wart, so I recommend buying a higher wattage charger.<br/><br/>This comes with Android 11.  I installed a few apps such as the Kindle app which surprisingly works much better as an app then the native program on the Kindle HD 10.  I also installed a few games, Asphalt 9, Castle Wreck, Bubble shooter and Klondike Forever and lastly the You Version Bible app. None of those apps besides  the kindle were available in the Kindle app store.  All the apps worked well enough, although Castle Wreck did cause the tablet to slow down due to the amount of rendering involved in that game, and the low amount of physical ram.<br/><br/>So why should you buy this tablet?  If you don't want to pay for a pad from another fruity company, but want more than can be had from the Kindle HD 10 this is for you.  That is really the best comparison to The Samsung A8.  Provided you purchase a 4gb model, it functions much better than the HD 10, the biggest advantage is native access to the Google Play Store, and a full fat version of Android 11.  Don't expect a feature rich tablet like the S line of Samsung, but if you are interested in light web browsing, casual gaming and reading, as well as streaming media playback, this tablet will work well.<br/><br/>So in the end, this tablet is a good enough introduction to the tablet market.  With the affordable price, it is a good tablet for children, classrooms with a good screen protector and case, or for that family member who could use a tablet, but would not have the use of a more expensive unit.  I started this review by recommending only the 4gb models, (64/128 storage).  Believe me, you will notice a difference.  4gb of ram is quite low by today's standards, and you will notice that in the performance.  Web pages refresh a little to quickly, and after a day of use, the tablet will become noticeably slower, requiring a reboot.  This can be mitigated a bit by fully shutting off programs, (swiping up, and swiping away open programs) as well as limiting notifications.  As of now, there is no indication that Samsung intends to update this tablet to Android 12, but perhaps there will be a work around.  Be careful, as the A8 is very low in specifications, and forcing a newer OS unintended for the product might cause it to age quicker then designed.<br/><br/>Overall the A8 does meet my needs, and while not wonderful in any way, it gets the job done under $400, which is a plus.</span>

<span>I pretty much concur with the other reviewers about this tablet. It's a good basic tablet with a decent picture and good battery life. One outstanding feature, the audio! This the best audio I have ever heard, stereo no less, coming from a tablet.<br/><br/>Now to the downsides. Do not buy the 32gb model if you can at all avoid it. It is slow with very little storage for programs. I've read many complaints about Samsung not allowing you to store programs on a micro sd card.  This isn't strictly true as you can store certain programs on the micro sd card if the program itself allows it. Unfortunately, most programs don't allow it. Get all the base storage you can.<br/><br/>To the more important feature...the wifi. I was perplexed as to why my download speeds on this unit were so slow...roughly a third of any of my other devices including much less expensive Amazon tablets. After extensive google research, I found an answer if a slightly inconvenient one. If you cycle the airline mode button (on then off) bammo, the speed jumps to a normal if not breathtaking level. It works every time, who knows why other than you are in essence resetting the wifi.<br/><br/>All things considered, I'm keeping it especially after the recent Amazon sale.</span>

<span>Already have a regular sized iPad, bought the Mini for portability -- hiking, biking, etc. Obviously security is an important issue, but I deal with that by never keeping important info on a travel-pad. No bank accounts, no investment accounts, no medical info, very few passwords. So all the passcodes and finger printing and eyeball scanning and two-factor authenticating and password retrieving is an annoyance. Theoretically you can skip inputting the security features, but then you have to go through the skipping process every time Apple updates its OS, which seems to be every Tuesday. Ultimately the problem arises because many (most?) people are psychopaths who will help themselves to your info given the opportunity, so understandably Apple has to take precautions. But Windows devices aren't half as bad.</span>

Came brand new in a sealed, never opened Apple box with the charger. It just does literally everything my old one did and the only reason I bought it was because Apple forced me to. My old one worked just fine and still had great battery life… but whatever I guess it’s on their list of products that are to old to support anymore.<br/>So hopefully this one lasts another 6 years like the last one.

<span>First let me tell you I was hesitant about buying an iPad Mini. I even considered buying an iPad Pro: I have had two 9.7" iPads (series 4 and series 6) so I thought I would miss a larger screen. Turns out, I didn't. I will give you a few hints on what to expect with this device:<br/><br/>Pros:<br/>* Higher resolution: One of the main factors that led me to buy this tiny beast was the screen resolution (319 ppi),  which is higher than any other iPad's resolution. I highlight this feature because I use my iPad primarily to read and watch IT videos.<br/>* Portability (it's really lightweight! You will be astounded when you pick one of these)<br/>* Size (You can hold the whole device with one hand while writing with the other, something unthinkable in larger iPads).<br/>* Battery life (Discharge rate: about 5% / hour when playing videos; Charge rate: about 10% / 14 min)<br/>* TouchID (Very convenient, and it recognizes the fingerprint very quickly)<br/>* Stereo speakers (they sound really good!)<br/>* Apple Pencil support (When paired with an Apple pencil, it's a breeze. I'm using a note-taking application that allows me to use my iPad as a small notebook. It made me wish I had done this while I was still studying).<br/>* Three months of Apple TV+, Apple Arcade and Apple Music (Apple gives you three months of Apple TV+, Apple Arcade and Apple Music by only purchasing the device. So I'm enjoying a series in Apple TV+ "For all mankind" and it really looks great in this screen. I'm planning to watch other productions during these three months).<br/><br/>Cons:<br/>* No silent mode switch (I use teh control center to lower the volume when needed)<br/>* No FaceID (I use the TouchID and it's very convenient and fast)<br/>* No raise to wake (I gently double tap the screen to wake it up).<br/>* No Promotion (There is no workaround to this. The device has a standard 60hz screen, so you will have to decide if you accept it or not)<br/>* Some users report sort of a "jelly effect" in the screen when you fast scroll the screen. I haven't noticed anything similar to this behavior in any direction (up, down in vertical nor portrait mode).<br/><br/>A word of advice about storage:<br/><br/>* If you're thinking about this device, go for the 256 GB one. That was my selection, and I'm glad I did it, because after only one week of usage, I have already used 35 GB of storage. Had I selected the 64 GB version, I would be worried about the storage already.<br/><br/>Conclusion:<br/><br/>The iPad mini lacks some features its bigger brothers have, but despite this fact, this is totally a great device. If you can sacrifice those features in favor of portability (or you find a way to sort them, as I did), you won't regret. Hopefully we will be able to see an "iPad Pro Mini" in the future (I hope Apple folks read this review someday), but for now, I'm very happy with this purchase. I'm declaring myself an iPad mini fan from now on.</span>

<span>For context, I purchased this tablet on sale for $109.00. Additionally, I have been using Samsung Galaxy S series phones for a decade, previously used a Samsung tablet from about 2013-2015, and currently use both a Fire HD 8 (2020 model) tablet and a Fire 7 (2019 model) tablet. Finally, I purchased this because I needed a tablet with access to Google Play Services for a specific set of purposes.<br/><br/>First of all, it's important to keep in mind that the Galaxy A series is Samsung's "budget" line of tablets and smartphones, and this is the cheapest of their tablets. The performance is not going to be as good as the flagship Series S or Series Z devices; if you have, for example, an S22 as your phone, you should not expect the performance of this tablet, the screen, etc to match that. It also is not going to meet the specs and quality of iPads, Surfaces, or other high-end tablets. That being said, Android tablets overall are much better quality than they were several years ago, which my experience with this tablet has confirmed for me.<br/><br/>The screen is good--much better than I expected. Everything is clear and sharp, and there's basically no pixilation. It does have a lower pixel density than a lot of other devices, but more than most budget Android tablets. The screen can also be slightly difficult to view from certain angles, although that shouldn't be an issue for 99% of use cases; it can also be a bit difficult to see in brighter lights. In terms of physical qualities, it's basically the same as the screen on my S21.<br/><br/>The sound is also better than I expected. It doesn't seem to carry as far as other devices--once again, not a huge issue--but it's loud and clear. The fact that there's an audio jack is appreciated, and one can always connect a speaker or headphones via bluetooth.<br/><br/>The extra 1GB of RAM compared to my Fire HD 8 is definitely noticeable in most cases, although this is still not what I would call a speedy device. If you're just watching video, listening to audio, and reading, this will be irrelevant to you outside of saving a second or so when you open an app, pull up the keyboard, or turn on the tablet. I have not played any games on it, but I assume that more demanding ones would have some noticeable difficulties on this.<br/><br/>Battery life seems great so far. The tablet supports fast charging, but the included charger does not.<br/><br/>The tablet is lightweight, although compared to my Fire HD 8, it is not as comfortable to hold. The materials used are also very nice, and it doesn't look or feel like a budget tablet. It's small enough that fitting it into most bags or purses shouldn't be difficult. The fact that storage is also expandable up to 1 TB is appreciated. The charging port is USB-C, which is basically standard nowadays, although many budget devices still use micro-USB, so it's worth mentioning.<br/><br/>The cameras are adequate, and are fine for Zoom, Skype, and other video sites. I have not used the microphone, but I assume it's also serviceable.<br/><br/>There are seemingly some interesting options to connect this to a Samsung phone, although I am not using those. Still, this could be a nice option for some people.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, there do not seem to be very many good cases available for this model. There do appear to be a lot of "heavy-duty" cases for it though, which is nice if you're purchasing this for a young child.<br/><br/>Overall, if you can get this on sale--especially if you *have* to have access to Google Play Services or otherwise can't or don't want to use Fire OS--this is definitely a great choice for a tablet. It will get updates and remain usable for far longer than similarly-priced and cheaper Android tablets from Onn, Chinese manufacturers using the names of old American brands, and the like. That being said, if you're primarily looking for a device for consuming content--which is what the overwhelming majority of people use tablets for--I'd still recommend the Fire HD 8, especially during one of the many times per year that it goes on sale, as I don't feel that the differences are worth the extra $50.00-$110.00 the A7 Lite will cost. Still, this is probably the best inexpensive Android tablet on the market today, and is a fantastic option to consider if you're looking to purchase one.</span>

<span>I gave this four stars instead of five. I've been begging Amazon to come out with a new HDX 8.9. This is what I had to get as an alternative. I like to take mine when I travel. The screen is smaller on this one and it weighs much more than the HDX 8.9. Don't know why they didn't stick with a good thing. The bigger screened one (the 10 in. one) is REALLY heavy....does have a good screen size. Works for home use. This one would have been perfect if it weighed less and the screen was bigger.</span>

<span>I do not mean "Wild" kindly, but I'll get to that shortly. Sorry for the long read, but I have a lot of thoughts about this particular product to inform you, the end-user of your purchasing decision before you commit a purchase, and as a responsible citizen of the Internet, I've heavily tested the tablet hands-on to see what I can make it do, how I can make it work and where Amazon's hires could improve the overall experience for a multi-adult household.<br/><br/>The tablet itself is functional. What else is there to say about it? Inside a home or building, so long the sun isn't shining directly on it the display is bright, with a clear, crisp display and along with a decent battery much bigger than your current handheld mobile device, you also get anywhere between a mediocre and acceptable tablet use experience, depending on how much money you hand to Amazon. I painfully regret not going with the Fire HD 10, but I am a bit of a cheapskate and after having seen what comes with the Fire HD Kids' Pro 8 through an encounter with a daughter of my mother's friend, I figured the Fire HD 8 Plus would be the same exact experience — and I can happily say, it is.<br/><br/>The inclusion of a three-pole phone socket for headphones and TF / micro SD slot for extra storage practically makes it the ideal tablet computer… until you try to use it as a multi-user tablet computer. But we'll get to those gripes later. First impressions of the hardware makes it seem like the absolute perfect device for personal and work use, domestic and abroad. A simple tablet with great features. Except for a GSM / SIM slot but if you already have a mobile handheld, the Fire can use wireless tethering whenever the tablet needs access to the Internet where WiFi isn't available, and it can do calls via WiFi so that's something if your friends aren't using any of the supported social network platforms available through Amazon's app market.<br/><br/>Fire OS on the other hand, that's uhm — fun. Yes, fun. If you receive nothing else from this, should you be the sole adult of the tablet, then you have nothing to worry about. Everything just works — for you. For anyone else? Yeah, nah. Show mode is honestly a great inclusion, as well Alexa Hands-Free — it's like if you have a general-purpose tablet, Amazon Show desktop unit and phone (which can only do calls via WiFi) for what was at the time of Prime Day anywhere between sixty and eighty dollars depending on device capabilities. What a bargain!<br/><br/>…For the primary user. Second adult? Nah, can't do Show Mode, Alexa Hands-Free or WiFi calling. But children can do calls with approved contacts and permission from their parents! That hardly makes any sense — if you're not a child you don't get to make calls beyond the primary profile? Why? Speaking of kids, if you think that kids' launcher or adult settings will let you move off all of the kids' apps to an SD card, ha ha nope. So your child will very likely make using the tablet almost impossible after they stuff the internal storage with nothing but pointless games.<br/><br/>For a couple, it makes even less sense to buy this for the intent of using voice recognition features. Sure, auto guy and shop girl can keep their profiles separate, but only one of them get the privilege of using all of the tablet's features. A second adult profile is like a grown-up kid, and feels almost demeaning, which likely means whoever wears the pants between two people will be the one with the primary account which does everything. And what if they want to share applications? There's no easy way to do this beyond reinstalling them on the other profile. I've looked, and there seems to be no way of easily sharing apps between adult profiles which especially makes installation of such things as Google Play a major drag without third-party guidance and tools.<br/><br/>It's an Amazon device, so of course it will advertise Amazon everything — even Washington Post. If you don't use that service, too bad can't disable. If you don't care about Amazon's other services, too bad shove it in a folder on the Fire Launcher. Without tinkering beyond what Amazon allows you to do, it kind of makes using the tablet a terrible experience being inundated with all of these Amazon-owned things at once, and for some people the constant upselling is enough to warrant a return.<br/><br/>If you can get over all of that — and again, if you are the sole adult of the tablet, none of the above save for the upsells are really an issue — then you have yourself a capable and handy little Android-based tablet which will do almost everything you want. A solid product with a mediocre and terribly flawed OS, but one if you've committed your entire life to Amazon may be welcome. As I exhibit no such brand loyalty I'm exceedingly annoyed, but all of the thorns and papercuts are nothing a little bit of tinkering cannot cleave and become rid of.<br/><br/>EDIT 07/06/21.1: Minor correction, seems like while four-pole may fit, I can't use external mic with the tablet or Fire OS doesn't disclose how to do this.<br/>EDIT 07/06/21.2: Grammar and error corrections</span>

<span>I've had this tablet for a couple of months now, and overall I really like it. It's a bit faster than my old tablet. It has a good amount of storage, I also use a memory card with my tablet. I like that the battery life is really good and it charges up pretty quickly, too. The screen size is great and i love how good the graphics are when it comes to the games and pictures.<br/>My only disappointment (that I found out recently) is that I can't connect my tablet to my laptop to download a document if I need to and I don't have my internet. I used to be able to do this with my old tablet, but I'm disappointed that this function is not available with this newer tablet.</span>

<span>I won't go into all of the technical aspects since those have been done to death (but perfectly) in many of the other reviews.<br/><br/>I ordered this as a package with the wireless charger stand that converts it into an Alexa device when mated.  The package arrived within the two day Prime shipping time, so I guess the CV19 is having less of an effect on Amazon shipping as time passes.<br/><br/>I actually had 2 Fire HD 10 tablets for complicated reasons that probably don't really fit the story.  I loved almost every aspect of the 10-inch tablet except the size when I was trying to read in bed.  It is just too big and awkward to comfortably hold.<br/><br/>I quickly opened everything and powered up the tablet and started what I thought would be the normal configuration procedure.  Almost everything was the same as with the other two tablets I had with the exception of the annoying animated video you have to sit through that explains the different functions and benefits of the Fire tablets.  There really should be an option that allows the animation to be skipped, especially for repeat owners.  During the configuration process, the tablet does download the latest updates to the operating system.  Since I previously had a Fire tablet that I had deregistered, the configuration process gave me the option to download all of the apps, settings, etc. from that tablet.  The odd thing was that since I had two tablets it only gave me the option to sync the information from the tablet I had deregistered and performed a factory reset on over a week ago and not the tablet I had just deregistered yesterday.  Other than that, everything went very smoothly.<br/><br/>After that process was complete, I went into YouTube and watched a video that I would recommend everyone with any of the Fire tablets should watch on Tips &amp; Tricks for the Fire HD 8.  It is a short video and gives instructions on several settings changes that are very beneficial and do not affect the warranty or stability of the tablet.<br/><br/>After getting everything configured to suit me I went to the Amazon APP store and downloaded a few more things that didn't transfer over from syncing the to the settings on one of my previous tablets.<br/><br/>Amazon may censor this comment, but I also sideloaded the Google Playstore so I could download several other apps that were critical to me.<br/><br/>After all that was completed, I was pleasantly surprised that several minor changes had been made to the user interface and other functions that are great improvements.  They are so subtle that most casual users may not even notice but I appreciate the upgrades.<br/><br/>The tablet is very snappy and the apps all execute very quickly.  The screen resolution is lower than the 10-inch tablets but since the screen is smaller I cannot discern any difference in viewing quality of icons, photos, or video.  The placement of the stereo speakers is better than the 10-inch tablet but since the device is so small there probably isn't much benefit.  I did connect to my Bluetooth earbuds and watch part of a movie and the sound quality and stereo sound stage are excellent.<br/><br/>The other improvements aside, the bottom line is that the form factor of the 8-inch table suits my needs much better.  This thing is very comfortable to hold and is still large enough to provide extremely good viewing quality at a fraction of the cost of Samsung and Apple tablets.  I have owned a couple of Samsung tablets and a Sony Xperia tablet in the past and for the most part, they are great tablets but are really overkill for the typical user.<br/><br/>When you decide you need a tablet make sure you make an accurate assessment of your actual needs and don't buy something that is bigger or more than what you really need.<br/><br/>Now...go read the in-depth technical writeups from other reviewers and more importantly watch several of the YouTube videos that demonstrate both the Fire HD 8 and HD 8 Plus to make sure they are right for you.</span>

I am much more partial to the mini sized tablets, but thought I'd go for it...soooo, even after reading all the bu.......t comments here, thought I'd try, if i didn't like it., I'd return it.<br/><br/>  1. Delivered on time, yayyy!<br/>  2. Package well protected, sealed, unblemished...perfect condition (and yeah..no fingerprints on<br/>  screen)<br/>  3. Ipad fired right up...70% charged<br/>  4.

(charged fairly fast!)<br/><br/>sooooooo...<br/>I'm keeping this jewel!!!!!<br/><br/>Risk is there...evidently, if you believe the nutso crowd and their comments here.

<span>I bought the iPad 9 because I had decided it was time to upgrade from my iPad Air 2 that I bought about 8 years ago. Honestly, while I could have gotten a different brand that cost less, I was impressed that my tablet had lasted so long. The battery had started to noticeably drain faster but that was the only problem I was having with it. After seeing how well Apple makes their products, I decided to stick with them when making my purchase. So far, the iPad 9 is performing well for me. I enjoy the screen resolution/response and it's bigger than my previous tablet. I mostly watch YouTube, check emails, and use it for things that my phone's screen is too small for. But, I've been wanting to get started with digital drawing and I feel that this tablet will be enough for me to get my feet wet. Maybe I can get another 8 years before upgrading again.</span>

<span>My first tablet was a Google Nexus 7 in 2012.  I've always used Android.  I can't imagine using a tablet that doesn't have a micro SD card slot or some provision for storing data locally.  I don't want a device that requires proprietary connectors.  I can't imagine using a tablet for anything but content consumption.  Without a decent user input interface you can't really do much else.  A touch screen keyboard is best suited for the old Twitter character limit.  Beyond that it's torture.<br/><br/>This tablet does what I want.  It has a nice 2K display.  It has more built in storage than I need and enough ram (6 GB) that most everything goes smoothly.  It could use a stronger processor but it has what you'd expect at this price level.  I stream video, browse the web, read, and play music with it.  It has a capable wifi adapter.  It can connect to my router at a usable speed from the house across the street.  I doubt that you could play many games with it but I prefer a controller or keyboard.  Again, think content consumption.  I've been looking for a tablet that's cheaper than an [name of well known very expensive tablet that starts with a vowel goes here] that will run the web interface for Moode Audio, my preferred streaming software, for several years.  This one does.  It has an occasional lag but so does my i7 desktop machine.<br/><br/>I bought this tablet for the RAM, storage, and processor.  At the Prime Day price the keyboard didn't matter.  It cost less than the same model without a keyboard from other sources.  The keyboard is disappointing.  It's large enough for human hands and it's possible to type on it but it doesn't interact well with the screen.  It's difficult to impossible  to click on window controls like close and sizing.  It's difficult to resize a window without using the touch screen.  I wouldn't want to do work with it.<br/><br/>I was a little surprised that a standard 5v 2a charger doesn't work well.  I'm a little behind the times.  An ordinary USB charger generates a check cable error message.  A 20w fast charger, like the one that comes with it, works fine.  A 2a charger will work but very slowly.  A 5v 3a charger is strong enough to avoid the error message but isn't as fast as the supplied charger.  Oh well, technology marches on.</span>

<span>I bought this to replace my Asus tablet (love the tablet but its 4 years old and won't update, and the processor is showing its age. Save it for books). I thought I would be returning the Lenovo right away, as I couldn't get anything to open fully in landscape mode. Turns out, you have to make sure that Productivity Mode is turned OFF or you won't be very productive. Like anything digital, you have to figure out the operating system they pack on top (Please Guys, JUST LEAVE IT ANDROID. They do it BEST!! That goes for Amazon, too!)<br/><br/>It's not the sharpest tack in the box but it's darn good! I play movies on it when I sneak off to get some me time. Stream classes on it and the picture is very good. Sound it better than my phones or previous tablets. The battery is okay. I make sure to take along a back-up battery when I take it out, as streaming and such can eat up your power fairly rapidly.  Its camera isn't half bad. Most tablets I've come across have crappy cameras, but this has taken good pictures and I have used it to photograph documents, paperwork, etc. while doing research and had reliable results.<br/><br/>Generally, I would suggest it to anyone wanting better than mid-range but not up to shelling out for top quality (though after this I just might go for Lenovo's top end; after I replace my desktop).<br/>It's great as a light laptop substitute for doing research and study when I have to be away from my desk but want to get some studying or personal education in. I also use it for genealogy, document producing, library books (though it can get heavy, have a prop), and various general uses. Being larger than my phone it's easier on my eyes!<br/>Would definitely buy again.</span>

<span>The tablet is all that it is advertised to be - I'm very happy with it so far.  Well, except for the fact that I couldn't start it up until I first charged it, and they DON'T include a charger!  They state that most customers already have another Samsung device so don't need another charger.  WRONG! (At least in my case.)  Their tech write-up misleads in this matter.  They either need to include a charger ($700 and no way to charge it!) or at least make it clear up front that you need to buy one separately.  That's my only complaint - otherwise this would get 5 stars...</span>

<span>Expected to only use this tablet for a small tasks and the occasional video while traveling. I found myself using it every day to the point of replacing my laptop on a day-to-day basis. I travel a week out of the month and usually only take the tablet to view spreadsheets and answer emails. Pair this up with a wireless keyboard to truly take advantage of Samsung Dex mode. While it won't replace your laptop for video or photo editing it has met most if not all of my needs. Not to mention that the battery life is far beyond what I expected when I purchased it, I can go days without charging it.</span>

<span>I absolutely love this tablet. Though, I was a little nervous about how the tablet would be since the box itself was a little beat up, as you can see in the pictures. But I tested it, and sound quality and picture quality are so far so good.<br/><br/>I am so happy that Amazon actually stocks it and sells it themselves. Because I was having a heck of a time trying to get one. I ordered a brand new one on Best Buy and the darn thing was scratched as if it was used. I was like heck no. I’m not spending $770 on a new tablet that you just re-boxed and labeled as new.<br/>So they send me a new one through ontrac and Best Buy had the audacity to pack it in a paper bag. Ontrac ended up throwing it at my door really hard. When I opened the thin paper bag the tablet box was all scuffed up like it was crushed and dragged. So I returned both and just ordered off Amazon instead.<br/><br/>Amazon was WAY cheaper. And you can trust it will get here on time and in good condition. There’s not a scratch in sight and the tablet is as great as my other s8 that I returned. Very happy with my purchase.</span>

<span>I've had this tablet for a little over two week. My main use for it is streaming movies. I usually have it going close 8 hours a day on Netflix hulu etc. Usually by the end of the day I have around 40 percent battery left. It's also great getting all on my text on it while my phone(s21 Ultra) is on my pocket. The screen quality is great in my opinion I use it at work in a well lite area and have no issues seeing anying.</span>
