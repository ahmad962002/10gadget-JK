The built-in USB 3.0 ports at the base provide a convenient way to connect your peripherals. Optimal Viewing The multi monitor mount features one -touch height adjustment. The smooth +/- 10 deg; tilt motion and +/- 90 deg; swivel make it easy to find the optimal viewing angle.

<span>I have had a mixed but mostly positive experience, and I don't believe there is a better product available. All other single-bar dual monitor mounts I've been able to find are clearly rebranded copies of this exact device. Maybe there was one other one, but it was $1K and unclear if it was better.<br/><br/>Pros: the arm is great. Strong, solid metal, smooth movement, easy to assemble and mount. Both the clamp and bracket mount come with the arm - I wasn't clear on that when I bought it. My monitors mounted on it without any trouble. They fit on the crossbar. The crossbar handle is useful and attractive. With adjustment, which is easy, the monitors stay where you put them and don't bounce much when typing. The ports in the base of the mount are easy to connect and very useful.<br/><br/>Medium: the cable management channels are not quite spacious enough. Expect to struggle getting all the cables in at once if you're using any upstream USB.<br/><br/>Cons:<br/>1. I asked a question to startech (read Q&amp;A above) referencing another commenters video which claimed the Vesa brackets cannot be tightened to prevent them sliding on the bar. The Startech response (claiming they can be locked down) is straight up misinformation. The previous reviewer is correct: the mounts CANNOT be tightened to prevent sliding on the bar. Practically this has not been a problem for me. The crossbar is level enough, and the monitors heavy enough, that the brackets stay where you put them on the crossbar. They certainly have no chance of falling out of the crossbar - it's very sturdy. But I'm deducting a star for this blatant misinformation from the manufacturer.<br/><br/>2. As another commenter claimed, the tilt of the crossbar *changes* when you change the position of the arm. The tilt is noticeable. This can be easily corrected with one hand, but if you move the arm in big motions often it could get annoying. Practically, going from sitting to standing is mostly what I use it for. It works pretty well for this purpose.<br/><br/>3. Biggest issue, and one nobody else mentioned, is that the tensioning on the crossbar is *terrible*. I tightened the bolts as hard as I could possibly get them. If I torque the handle wrong when moving the arm, the whole crossbar tilts on the arm. The crossbar is meant to have some wiggle room so you can adjust the tilt to compensate for the non-levelness I mentioned above in (2). But you're supposed to be able to tighten it down, and the bolts for this just needed to be way bigger and stronger. It's a really dumb design flaw for a $150 mount.<br/><br/>I'm dealing with these cons because this arm is still the best solution for me. I like being able to move from sitting to standing, or closer to further, in one motion. The cons of the arm are frustrating though, not least because it seems like they would have been really easy to fix and were just left thoughtlessly unfinished.</span>

<span>Holds my monitors in place quite sturdily, recovered a lot of desk space.  If your monitors are different weights, it will have a serious list to it.  You'll have to play around with arm length and main post location in order to center the screens to your desk without being offset or crooked.<br/><br/>Only reason it didn't get a fifth star: one of the 4 screw holes for the collar that clamps around main post wasn't drilled/tapped correctly.  I couldn't install the 4th screw.  3 hold it tightly enough that I decided to use it and not exchange it.</span>

<span>We purchased 8 of these for our Reservations department who had limmited desk space.  The installation was easy although I found it better not to follow the instructions verbatim but assemble the arms on the pole 1st, then attach to the desk.  The agents love them and they are adjusted to the height of the individual.  The price was right as we paid $20 for each monitor stand that did not do nearly as good a job as these pole mounted stands.</span>

<span>EXCELLENT product.  Everything from the ball joint that controls the tilt of the monitor, to the joints that make up the arms, to the height of the monitors is adjustable.  Amazing product, amazing price, and handles to 24" LED monitors like a champ.  One note:  the clamp that this uses to attach to the table needs a solid 4-6" of space.  There is a small support that runs under the top of my desk, so the clamp wouldn't slide on.  The clamp can be removed, and the stand drilled directly into the desk (see picture), and it works perfectly (cost me about $6 worth of bolts and washers at Lowes)  This is NOT a knock on the product... it works exactly as described... but if your desk isn't configured right, this can be modified to work, and work well.  I would buy this again in a second if I needed another monitor stand.</span>

The bracket allows you to position your monitor at eye level, which reduces neck and back strain and aches from length sessions in front of the computer.  The mount attaches to the edge of a desk, table, or other horizontal surface with a thickness between 0.87" ~ 2.25". The mount has a 14.5" jointed extension arm, which allows you to position your monitor at exactly the right height, angle, and distance. The monitor can be tilted, allowing for easy conversion between landscape and portrait mode on the monitor. It fits monitors up to 33 lbs weight with either 50x50, 75x75, or 100x100 VESA mounting pattern.  Features:  * Fits monitors with VESA 50x50, 75x75, and 100x100 mounting patterns * Tilts +/- 12 degrees * Rotates 360 degrees allowing for easy portrait or landscape orientation * Steel construction with welded base clamp and aluminum extension arm * Height adjustable from about 8.75" ~ 15" * Clamps to surfaces between 0.87" ~ 2.25" thick

<span>This mount can hang upside down.<br/><br/>I bought this braket knowing full well about the tilt and resulting adjustments. However, none of the comments were able to tell me if this product could be mounted upside down (In other words: mounting your display from a top shelf of a desk, etc.). If you were wondering if this product was capable of this - yes, this product can be mounted hanging outside down. However, it simply was not designed to do such a thing. In order to mount it upside down, you have to mount the braket on upside down and tighten the allen bolts on the tilt mechanism. This means that you lose the ability to tilt your monitor. You also have to tighten the tube extension found on the neck of the mount; otherwise, the tube droops down over time. You seem to be able to take apart one of the mechanical joints and reassemble it upside down in order to regain tilt mobility; however this takes much time and tools which are not provided with the item and difficult to find. This mount is difficult with swivel functions, even when aided by minor application of some WD-40. If you plan on using this mount upside down and seek great mobility, I would look elsewhere - but if your looking for a deal which requires minor maintenance and some thinking outside of the box, this product is for you.<br/><br/>I am delighted at this item and have no need to look elsewhere. Assembly took me about an hour, given the particular way I wanted to mount my monitor.<br/>I have a small 17" LCD monitor which weighs very little.</span>

<span>Very sturdy except with exception of the swivel that tilts the monitor up and down.  This swivel tends to slide a bit so your monitor faces down over time.  You have to hold the monitor in place and really crank on the &lt;little&gt; knobs in order to set it straight for a descent length of time.  The other minor issue with it being sturdy is the foot, which could be a little bigger to grab onto more desk.  I have a 24" monitor and I use the arm to swing out behind, hanging out over the back of my desk, which hangs in view of my couch.  At this angle it is slightly uneven, mostly due to the foot not having enough counter leverage at that angle.  There is impressively little bend in the arm itself at full extension.  Be careful with your desk type, I forgot to think about how the standard foot needs a nice flat 2-3" overhang of desk on the back to latch onto.  My glass top desk did not have that and I ended up building a kind of complicated little spacer for it to grab onto.  A quick look on my trip to various stores revealed that most new desk designs would not work either.  That is a problem for all of them I would think though, and given the substantial discounted price on this one it is a great buy and performs surprisingly well.</span>

<span>I have chosen to install this mount in a situation very outside of it's advertised support - and I'm very happy with the results.<br/><br/>My specs:<br/>A desk with at least 6 inches of wood on the back so clamping is a no-go.<br/>A 32-inch TV that is near the weight limit (30lbs) and uses 200x100mm VESA mount.<br/><br/>I prepared by having some extra screws and a 200x100mm VESA adapter kit on-hand (Amazon sells both!). My Desk has a thick wood top and back (not particle board crap).<br/><br/>I started by installing the adapter kit and taking off the bottom half of the clamp. Monoprice tightens these screws really tight - so be careful not to destroy the screw trying to get it out!.<br/><br/>With the clamp part of the bottom removed I used the 4 holes and marked my desk. 2 holes lined up with the top slab of wood and 2 with the wood back. Drilled some pilot holes and screwed it all in place with long wood screws. Surprisingly - this was a near perfect solution. I can't comment on the strength using the clamp, but I imagine this is as strong or stronger!<br/><br/>Next was installing the TV. The adapter kit worked perfectly and the TV mounted. Avoid using the knobs and go straight for the Allen key bolts that are used for the tilt adjustment if your TV is heavy like mine.<br/><br/>The mount is very sturdy at full height if you don't extend it. There is obvious leaning at full extension, but for being a 30lb TV it isn't much and I don't fear it breaking off. Anything less than full extension and the monitor arm holds up just fine.<br/><br/>Overall I'm very happy. I have a tiny 22 with a 100x100 vesa mount that will be getting this same monitor arm soon too!</span>

<span>Couldn’t stand the OEM stands that my 24” HP monitors came with so I gave these a try. To be honest my buddy had already purchased it for his setup so I know it’s durable. My question was going to be how easy is it to mount everything. It was easy. Really easy. I had the monitors mounted and back up and running in 15 minutes. The directions were easy to follow and everything was included in the kit. Just a little fine tuning to get the height and angles just right. I’m pretty happy with the setup.

<span>This monitor stand is actually pretty great. I bought it in early 2022 and the product I received didn't have any of the issues other reviewers mentioned. It's super solid. The desk clamp worked fine for me (it's super tight and will probably leave an indent on the desk's surface) and I'm using a single 27in 4k monitor with plans for attaching a wacom cintiq pro to the other arm thanks to the option of doing 100x100 Vesa or 75x75 with both sets of holes predrilled (right now it just holds my keys and sticky notes and stuff). It's also on an adjustable height desk that wobbles a bit when adjusting, but the monitor stand stays in place with no problem. It's rigid enough that tilting the monitor up and down takes some effort but not enough to feel like damage will occur over time with regular use. The arms fold and extend with no problem at all. I was able to loosen the bolts just enough to slide the arms up and down on the column without removing the monitor, which was great because I was pretty nervous about it crashing down to the desktop. The product is pretty much perfect for my needs, but I guess I would've liked a little more height on the column. I like to look straight into my monitor (not tilted up or down) to try to maintain the best posture while i work. And even with my desk at full height and if I'm standing up straight the center of the monitor doesn't sit square with my eye level, even though I measure everything. That's something to consider because the display arms basically sit above center because the monitor sort of hangs at the Vesa mount and the monitor is screwed on after. There's a vertical threaded screw there but the travel is like 0.25in each direction so not a lot of variation. And one thing to note in case it's not totally clear before purchase is that these arms will always be at the same height. They both attach to the same collar that sits around the column so they move together vertically. You can bend, fold, and tilt them separately but they will forever be at the same height vertically. All things considered that's not even close to being a deal breaker for me. In the end this is a great piece of equipment for my office setup and there's really nothing bad to say about its quality, functionality, or description on the Amazon listing. Ot even has a nifty toolbelt on the collar for storing the alan wrenches if you need to adjust them and a set of clips for cord management. I found this thing to be tip top 👍</span>

<span>I really like this desk mount. It's opened up a ton of desk space, and being able to raise my monitors has helped my posture, as well. It's sturdy and easy to put up, and works well even though my monitors are two separate sizes. There's only two things to be mindful of - for one, the arms don't move independently of one another, so keep that in mind if that's a feature you're looking for. The other thing is that if your desk is against a wall and you have acoustic panels behind it, you won't be able to push the monitors super far back because the arms will hit the panels. My desk is large enough that this isn't an issue, but it might be if you have a smaller desk.</span>

<span>For what you pay, this monitor stand is amazing.  It has great range of motion, it's easy to use, and it is exactly what I wanted.  The only negative I can think of is that the portion of the base that goes underneath whatever you clamp it to, is on the small size.  You can turn it to be either vertically or horizontally aligned which helps but thinner or softer materials (think particle board) could potentially wear out and cause a tear out.  I personally solved this with a 1/4" piece of plywood about 4 inches square.  I recommend this monitor stand.</span>

<span>I have three 25.5" monitors on my desk - each one had its own stand. I often moved them to try to get them right.<br/>I have two set vertically, with one horizontal one. I had to put blocks of wood under the horizontal one to get the height I wanted - but it was never right.<br/><br/>I set up the arms - very easy to put together, with excellent cable organizers. Once finished, I was briefly very disappointed - It was so claustrophobic, made my desk feel small, and honesty was stressful to work with. So I looked at the screens, and saw that they were all leaning down. A quick adjustment, and I now have a setup that I truly love. Its wonderful to sit in front of. I have space under my central screen for a couple of reference manuals, a photo, and my KVM switch.<br/>The screens are higher than they were on their original stands - I could adjust that to lower - but I really like it higher! Its very adjustable.<br/><br/>Important - I have three screens bigger than the stand says it can take. They only fit because I have two of them in portrait mode. Otherwise, they would not fit.<br/><br/>The screen position, angle and rotation are all very easy to adjust, yet once you tighten the hex screws (hex key provided) they are solidly in place.<br/><br/>I like everything about this - the cable management - the desk mound (I used the clamp, but there is also a fitting to screw directly into the the desk top). This simple thing has given me more desk space, and made my screens much comfier and nicer to look at.<br/><br/>If you have three screens, you need this. It is wonderful!</span>

<span>This is an easy way to get an array of monitors off your desk and all at the same height, provided your monitors are all the same size. I have a corner-style desk, so I need my three monitors to be at angles to each other in a manner commonly referred to as "cockpit style," and the articulated arms on this mount made that very easy to do. My monitors are now at a better eyeliner height than they were when sitting on my desktop, and there is a tilt adjustment that helps to refine that even more.<br/><br/>A couple of considerations:<br/>—— BIGGEST ONE FIRST: Obviously, you have to have monitors that have the four holes in the backs that allow for mounting. Many desktop monitor brands, even those that are listed as compatible with this mount, make monitors both with and without back mount capability. My previous HP monitors only had stands and could not have been attached to this stand.<br/>—— The mount is pretty heavy, which of course it has to be in order to support three monitors, so I had to enlist my husband for help when attaching it to my desk just to make sure I didn't drop it and dent anything!<br/>—— I have a tabletop-style desktop which has a lip around the edges on the underside. I was still able to use the clamp attachment by placing a wood block the depth of the lip in order to make it flush with the lip to make sure the clamp was fully engaged on a flat surface. I also put some furniture felt under the top clamp to protect my desktop even further.<br/>—— My 24" monitors fit with not a lot of room for play. If your monitors are larger than that, this will not work. Make sure you are measuring your monitors the right way. Contact the manufacturer if you have questions about how to measure your monitor to make sure it will fit. It would be a real pain to assemble this and find out that your monitors are a tad too large.<br/><br/>The bottom line: A good sturdy, fairly versatile mount that looks great and works well.</span>

<span>Having read some of the reviews, I was confident that this would be an excellent choice for my dual 24" monitor setup. I was not disappointed! It was easy to assemble and allows for a full range of adjustments to get the monitors just where you want. I have the arms "loose" enough that I can position them at slight angles when I'm working (the picture shows them side by side, which I rarely have them). As others have mentioned, the only drawback would be that you can pull the monitors out too far and the stand can fall forward, but I really don't see a need to have a configuration where the monitors would be positioned like that. Another reviewer had the ingenious idea of bolting it down to the desk using the bottom part of the stand under the desk to securely hold it it place. I would recommend this stand to anyone looking for a quality dual monitor setup.</span>

<span>This arm hit all the boxes for me. Triple articulation, clamp or grommet mount, and tall enough to hold my 27" monitor 10" off the desk.<br/><br/>Assembly was easy with a couple caveats. The plastic rings that clamp to the pole kept coming out of the metal ring that holds them until I specifically held onto them while attaching the arms. The instructions were adequate but it took me 20 minutes to realize that there was a height adjustment screw because the instructions hid it in the same step as tilt adjustment (and the instructions have no words, only pictures).<br/><br/>Once assembled the arm felt sturdy. One end sagged more than the other despite the monitors being identical (24-27-24") but once I found the aforementioned height adjustment that fixed me up.<br/><br/>Overall for the price I think this is an excellent choice. Things that could be improved:<br/> - Cable clips are good but not large enough<br/> - For grommet mounting I wish cables could be fed through the main stand piece but the clamp style used makes this impossible<br/> - Plastic clamp rings should be rubber instead</span>

<span>The monitor stand is fantastic. The only change I would make is that the screw to attach it to the desk surface has a bolt that is too long. It would be better if it came with an alternative shorter bolt. I have the Rocelo 37.5 in height adjustable standing desk converter and when I lower the surface, the bolt handle hits the desk (see image) keeping me from lowering the desk converter all the way. Being the same brand and recommended together on Amazon, I was not expecting this to be a problem. Also, if you will notice in the photo, the bolt on this monitor mount hits the bar on the back of the standing desk converter, meaning I have to risk stability of the mount by not pushing it all the way against the edge of the surface.<br/><br/>All that being said, these issies are fairly minor as I spend very little time seated. In general, the monitor stand is very sturdy and simple to put together and holds my heavy acer monitor next to my lightweight HP without any leaning or obvious strain.</span>

<span>When I compared this unit's features &amp; cost to the more expensive competition, I had low expectations, but my budget required a practical purchase over features that I likely would not need or use.  I must say that I regret NOTHING!  This is an amazing unit!  It is being used to hold a center 27" LED flanked by 2 older (heavy) Samsung 22" monitors.  The mount is very sturdy (I used the through desk option for my application), the arms are solid, and the cable management clips are intuitive and effective.<br/><br/>Easily avoid disappointment by taking some time to dial in the tension off the arms and Mount plate, as well as the tuning the mount fine adjustment in order to get the right height (alignment).  The instructions are picture only, but I suspect that is to save in manufacturing costs, as it avoids the expense of translating in to numerous  languages.  Despite no written instruction, the images are sufficient to understand assembly and adjustment steps with a minimal amount of study.<br/><br/>Given the reach of the arms, if your application is mounting small flanking monitors, you must accommodate space behind the stand/desk for the arms to recede in to.  If you plan/need this to mount using the desk clamp (places the stand at the very backmost point of the desk), have your desk against/near a wall, and will be using smaller monitors than capacity; prepare to pull your desk away from the wall up to 12" or look for a triple mount stand with a lower max monitor size rating (which will have shorter arms and you can avoid writing a negative review).</span>

<span>I'm using 3 Samsung 22" 226BW monitors on a hard 90degree L-shape desk. The stand and monitors are pushed all the way back against the cube and the stand tilts forward. I'm not using the bottom anchor as I didn't want to drill a hole my work desk. I have some heavy books laying across the base. This could have be resolved if the base was heavier.<br/><br/>The arm adjusters tighten with a provided wrench. There are lots of negative reviews about not getting the monitors to line up. The reason for this is that versa mounts can be rotated 360 degrees but there are no locks so you may have one at 90 and another at 0 if this happens your monitors will be off. You will have to remove the monitor and rotate the mount. Very stupid that they are symmetrical or marked. My biggest complaint is that the tilt bolts are hard to tighten.<br/><br/>I will probably us a steel plate to stop the tilting forward but dread having to remove the monitors and put them back. It took me 2 hours to get them to line up perfectly (of course my mounts were rotated). I would recommend using bicycle seat adjuster bolts if you have some. It would make the design 50x better.<br/><br/>Overall I do have more room on my desk as my monitors where all using their factory stands and sat about 1-2 inches lower. I like the new height and the additional space I have for my notebook. The price was good as I looked at a solution 2-3 years ago and the cost was just too high. I wouldn't recommend this version for the non-DIY'er b/c they would just complain about it non-stop.</span>

<span>This is a very high quality monitor stand that is only lacking in one area that is preventing it from getting the 5th star from me.<br/><br/>First off, the bang for buck here is incredible. I've heard of people spending upwards of $150 - $200 to get a stand to do what this does and I got this stand at the $90 price point with free shipping. And the stand is extremely flexible; all the bending and tilting it does will allow you to get the perfect set up you'd like. (I'd recommend sticking with 23.6" or smaller monitors so you can have some more wiggle room to make adjustments. Yes it can support 24" monitors, I tested it, but I prefer 23.6" and smaller for that extra bit of adjustability and wiggle room.)<br/><br/>Second off, if you're like me and like to specifically view the 1 star reviews of products to see what complaints people have, you're going to come across some misguided folk who are going to lie to you. You will read from some of the 1 star reviews that you can not adjust the tension for the vertical tilt of the monitors. That is false. You CAN adjust the tension required to adjust the vertical tilt on the monitors. There are black end caps on the vesa mounts that you have to pop off to see a bolt that you can tighten via the wrench that is included.<br/><br/>And that brings me to my next point - props to Mount-It! for including all of the necessary tools / screws for installation, along with very easy to read instructions.<br/><br/>Now you're probably wondering what stopped me from giving this stand 5 stars. The center pole does not have a large enough opening at the top to fit power cables, larger HDMI cables (rocketfish cables for example) or DVI cables through it, so it was disappointing to discover that I could only run small HDMI cables through it. I can imagine what it would look like if I was able to run all my cables through the stand and have them all disappear from sight. It would look glorious. Unfortunately, Mount-It! must not have considered how thick some connections can be, which led to a slight degree of disappointment.<br/><br/>EDIT:<br/>A few moments ago I discovered you can pop off a cap at the top of the center pole that is limiting the diameter of the pole, thus, increasing the number of cables and variety of connections that you can fit through the hole. It feels pretty cramped with just three cables in there though, and considering you need to be able to fit 6 to hide all cables.... This aspect is still slightly limited and disappointing. Staying at four stars until I can get all 6 cables to be hidden.<br/><br/>Overall, I'd highly recommend this stand to a friend. And to strangers, too, of course.</span>

<span>Summary:<br/>If you are looking for a seamless clean look for 3 monitors, do not buy this. You will be wasting your time and money.<br/><br/>I have three 24" HP V242H monitors that I wanted lined up horizontally with a seamless look. Having worked with triple monitor setups over the last 15 years, one of the most important things is to get the proper viewing angle. When you are sitting 2-3 feet away, you do not want to swivel your head too far left or right to strain your neck. If you sit too far away, you will strain your eyes from reading. So it needs to be a perfect setup or you are just going to tire yourself out and be non productive.<br/><br/>First thing I noticed is that the base is absurdly humongous. On a regular desk, it takes up half the width! Not everyone wants to drill a hole in a desk to mount. By using this stand with its base, you effectively removed half of your desk space.<br/><br/>Second thing is that this stand breaks up at around 12-15 degrees at the curvature point. What happens is that the outer monitors push heavily on the outside edges of the middle monitor. At some point, it "breaks" and all three monitors cannot be angled anymore. This 12-15 degree angle offers very poor viewing perspective.<br/><br/>The only way I have been able to get these monitors inwards more to 20 degrees, is to continue to push the two outer monitors inwards and have their inside edges overlap the middle monitor. The disadvantage is that they don't line up well by "snapping" together to give that seamless look.<br/><br/>Another problem with this stand is that the manufacturer puts the caps on the areas when shipped, where they can be adjusted. Those caps are really hard to get off and look like part of the arm. I spent way too much time with monitors that kept falling forward and not being able to adjust them. Until I noticed that I can remove the caps and use the wrench, that problem went away. The manufacturer didn't show these locations in the manual and had the caps on by default - especially near the curvature points.<br/><br/>Another problem is that the center pole is too small diameter wise. It is not possible to feed three DVI-D and HDMI connectors through it. Also, the exit hole of those cables is too small. Try that with 3 DVI-D cables and it is impossible,<br/><br/>A better design would be deliver a product with arms that allowed up to 2-4" more in length and to let them slide in or out.</span>

<span>I bought this for a few reason, (1) to get the monitors elevated to a higher level and (2) to use the monitors for triple monitor gaming.<br/><br/>The Pros:<br/>* This stand is sturdy and holds my three 24 inch monitors with no problems.<br/>* Assembly was easy and took about 20 minutes with no issues<br/>* The range of vertical adjustment is great. I put them one notch down from the top and my monitors are 9 inches above my desk.<br/>(Measured from the desk to the bottom of the monitor) I am 6 ft tall and I like the monitors to be raised to where my eyes are almost at the center.<br/>* Great cable management, center shaft is hollow and the arms have clips for cords/cables.<br/><br/>The Cons:<br/>* with 24 inch monitors you are not able to get a wrap around effect as the sides of the monitors touch and stop them from wrapping past a certain point.  They are not straight across but don't surround you enough for gaming. I think I will have to make a bracket to allow them to off-set further outboard. If you are going to use three 24 inch monitors and you want more of a wrap around you may not be pleased.<br/><br/>Summary:  Other than the one con, an excellent quality product. For more of a wrap around use smaller monitors (22 Inch) or for 24's get a stand that can hold 27's, this should allow more space between the monitors, letting you bend the arms in more.</span>
