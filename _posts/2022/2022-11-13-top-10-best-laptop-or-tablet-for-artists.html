<div class="slideshow-container">
<blockquote><em><div class="a-row a-spacing-small review-data"><span class="a-size-base review-text review-text-content" data-hook="review-body">
<span>I use this mainly to annotate Word documents, using the tools on the "draw" tab in Word. For that, it works well. It has fairly good control to allow me to mark or write where I intend. I would not say that I can make writing look great, or as good as I can with a pen and paper or even with an Apple Pencil on an iPad, but on the documents I am annotating, it is not important to make things look perfect.<br/><br/>I will say that this is not exactly plug-in-play (at least on a Windows machine). When you plug it in, Windows does recognize it and does some setup. But, I did have to go onto Wacom's site to download the setup file and manually run it. Once I did that, it opened a pretty typical setup dialog box and it was very easy from there. You do have to restart your machine halfway through the process, so it is best to close everything besides your browser before you start the setup. Once the setup is complete, it works very well. The pen comes with one nib already inserted and then there are three extra nibs stored in the base of the pen (which screws apart).</span>

<span>I've used many Wacom products for the past 20 years<br/>from the graphite (price similar to this one) to Intuos XL and M touch (=today's Intuos pros),<br/>Cintiq 13HD, and these day I use Cintiq 24 PRO for work.<br/><br/>I am planning to travel around while working since my work is currently remote<br/>and can be done anywhere as long as I have a pc and a tablet to draw.<br/><br/>I initially thought of using my new ipad but I could not get used to the apps<br/>and the apple pen cause I was so used to the precision of a Wacom pen.<br/>Next thing was to bring a laptop + my old Intuos 5 M touch around<br/>but I realized I don't even need the M size and it won't fit my tote bag.<br/>Plus, it's pretty heavy to carry around with a laptop.<br/><br/>So, I decided to look into cheaper and smaller Wacom tablets that I can use<br/>without worrying about damaging or losing, and this one was perfect!<br/>It's also wirelessly connectable via Bluetooth which I liked.<br/><br/>PROS:<br/>1. Really small and light-weight to carry around<br/>2. Great pricing<br/>3. This is great for beginners - intermediate artists<br/>4. Wired and wireless<br/>5. Easy setup<br/>6. Precise Pen just like any other Wacom pens<br/><br/>CONS:<br/>1. The surface is a little too rough and it makes my hand clench my pen a bit harder<br/>since I need to use more force to draw something with a darker opacity compared to other pro-line-up tablets I have (cintiqs, Intuos Pros all have smoother surface that's just good enough and not too slippery like ipads)<br/><br/>2. Because the bezel around the active area is really thin (which is a pro for it's small size and lightweight), your palm might feel a bit awkward at times because there's no edge for your hand to rest on.<br/><br/>3. The build quality of the pen that comes does feel a bit cheap but it still draws without any issue and no battery's needed.<br/><br/>OVERALL:<br/>-I would recommend this to beginners who just wanted to get into digital art without overspending.<br/><br/>-I pasted on a paper-like screen protector made for a screen tablet so it's smoother than the original Intuos's rough surface. This will allow my hand to be more relaxed and the pen nib will probably last longer.<br/><br/>-For those who already own more advanced Wacom tablets, don't expect this to be on the same level of comfort as the pro lines but it's a nice tablet for traveling. I highly recommend you attach some kind of smoother texture screen protector on the tablet as I did because, without it, I find it harder to draw big curved lines (due to too much friction). My hand gets really tired quickly.<br/><br/>-Overall, I'm happy with it as it's wireless and easy to carry around. I would recommend it for any artists beginners - intermediate.</span>

<span>I bought this product to have something to draw from off of my laptop. For the price and the 3 softwares that were included, this product was more than worth it. The set-up process was very easy. You can set-up the touch screen to be as sensitive or as non-sensitive as you'd like. I've had no problems with the product or my laptop thus far when I use it. I really like that you can customize the 4 buttons at the top to perform whatever functions you'd like such as undo or redo. Altogether, the buttons act as a holder for the pen as well, which I think is a nice addition. I highly recommend this product for beginners, however, it can take some time to get used to since you're just drawing on a tablet and not an actual screen. It took me a while to get the hang of not having to look down every time I draw with it, but other than that, for the price and for the 3 free softwares that are included, this is a great product for beginners.</span>

<span>I have a huion 22inch display tablet for my desktop and I got this guy for my Mac laptop. It was exactly what I needed, I started off on a small ancient Wacom (3x3) so this was easy to adjust to. The express keys at the top save a lot of time and are easy to set up. I also love how light and easy it is to carry but doesn't feel flimsy. I got the Blutooth version and the charge holds for a very long time even with heavy use. Surprise bonus was the free software! Plus, I love the cute teal color I got it in.<br/><br/>The price is fair but might be steep for a beginner artist, I recommend to wait for a sale or consider other brands— I personally recommend Huion, as XP Pen has a reputation of taking advantage of artists through 'contests' and conventions.  But please feel free to do your own research and come to your own decision.</span>

<span>Does the job.<br/><br/>Don't expect the Wacom branding to stay on the glove. It doesn't take much for the branding to peel off...</span>

<span>Coming from a big brand like wacom, i honestly expected a lot. However, the glove itself is pretty thin, cheap quality and the stitching is pretty terrible with no reinforcement.<br/>Obviously, the glove works. It greatly improved performance as I no longer had hands sticking to my tablet, and it just made sliding over surfaces easier. The fingerless design is nice, but it didn't do much for my shorter-than-average fingers.<br/>Construction wise, definitely not worth the money. The material itself (recycled or not, if it's lame, it's lame) is thinner than spandex and half as stretchy. The edges are unfinished and fray super easily, as they don't have any stitch bordering or reinforcement. The stitches themselves are pathetic, and the fraying thin material in combination with the weak stitching forms the perfect combo for the glove falling apart at the seams.<br/>I've used this glove about 4-6 hrs a week for the past month or so, and it's already falling apart from the seams. I just bought a huion glove as a replacement, and it has much better quality materials and looks as though they ran over all the open edges with a serger.<br/>While this wacom glove works, there's definitely better choices for the money, environmentally friendly or not. I know that these gloves are meant to be replaced over time, but I still expected a bit more quality for 10 bucks. This is more of a 2.99 purchase considering the quality.</span>

<span>I didn't expect much out of this. I will admit it works well for hand gliding. Just keep in mind it is very thin material, so you will need to take extra precautions putting it on. So if you have a large hand like in my situation it is a but if a tight fit.</span>

<span>I am one who will buy a product based on reviews and all of the reviews here were giving this chrome book such high praise, I figured it’d be worth a shot.<br/>What did I need? Something slim, lightweight, easy to transport, something with speed and CHEAP.<br/>I was in desperate need of a new laptop b/c mine is a dinosaur, very clunky and sloooow. Being in school is what really got me looking and trying to save up for a MacBook was never going to happen on my student budget. This little Lenovo chrome book is quick, sleek, and slim. And most of all, only $100. No touch screen but the battery life is incredible. I use it a few hours every day and only have to recharge it every 3-4 days. I use this chrome book for Google docs, internet surfing/research and e-mail. With that being said, I’m not using much storage so I can’t speak to that.<br/>GREAT buy as it was everything I needed for an unbeatable price.</span>

<span>I got a replacement and it's exactly what I wanted! Lightweight and the learning curve isn't so bad if you've never used a chromebook before, it only took me a few days to get used to it. It's very different from a normal computer and only good for light browsing and writing, I also got a large micro sd card for storage since it's barely got any, but I love it!<br/><br/>OLD REVIEW:<br/>The laptop itself is adorable, I love the look and feel of it, but I was either sent a broken computer or it was broken by the postal service handling it too roughly. It booted quickly, at least, so my disappointment was immediate. :(<br/><br/>I've put in for a replacement, so I'll be updating my review once that one arrives in two days.</span>

<span>My old Wacom lasted me about 8 yrs. It still works to but I figured I was due an upgrade. Enter the latest Intous Pro. This thing is such an improvement over older models. It has an awesome weight to it making it feel sturdy but not overly heavy. I love the new streamlined look and the convenience of blue tooth. Definitely happy with my upgrade!</span>

<span class="cr-original-review-content"> ¡Encantada con la facilidad de uso y sobre todo el tiempo optimizado! Hoy luego de años de uso full, trabajando ilustraciones de todo tipo por incontables horas y además editando fotografías y videos puedo decir que ha sido una maravillosa compra.<br/><br/>Al inicio tuve dudas para comprarla por el tema del lápiz y sus puntas, ya que los críticos mencionaban el desgaste rápido de las mismas en tan solo unas horas o una semana y esto realmente es algo serio de pensar ya que afecta brutalmente nuestro bolsillo, así que tome precauciones y compre unas cuantas puntas adicionales para no quedarme en medio del camino. (a la fecha de hoy 26/06/2022 tengo todas mis puntas sin usar, incluyendo las de repuestos. próximamente usare una, ya es justo)<br/><br/>• Las características del lápiz de presión de última generación, son las que promete, se siente bien y visualmente se ve bien, me alegra que también hallan incluido 10 puntas de recambio (6 de plástico y 4 de fieltro, estas últimas no creo probarlas ya que me viene bien las clásicas)<br/><br/>Por otro lado, hablan del desgaste que se refleja en la superficie con el uso prolongado (se raya) mencionan que la solución es comprar por separado las "hojas de textura" que vende Wacom. Puedes alterar el tacto de la superficie con la hoja que prefieras ya que vienen en hojas rugosas, medias y lisas, esto lo puedes probar tú mismo con la muestra que incluyen. Yo nunca compré una, ¡no veo la necesidad de hacerlo para mí! Una vez que me llegó empecé a usarlo tal y como venía, pero finalmente decidí usar una de esas hojas de plastificar tamaño carta; sólo uso una hoja, la despego y tengo la segunda de reserva (sólo he cambiado 4 veces en todos estos años que son 2 hojas de plastificar) ¡esto ha sido genial! cumple el propósito de cuidar la superficie y disminuir el desgaste acelerado de las puntas sin afectar el trabajo. (el tacto es suave y limpio ya que es liso).<br/><br/>- ¡Me encanta el anillo táctil ya que me ayuda a crear accesos directos en función de mi trabajo!<br/>- La configuración del espacio de trabajo en la superficie es fácil y muy práctica si quieres reducir el campo de trabajo en tu tableta de tamaño M (opcional).<br/><br/>¡No todo es genial! Dejo 4 estrellas porque el uso del bluetooth inalámbrico no es fiable. La mayoría de las veces es lento, algo que es un problema para alguien que quiere ser productivo, también si no te gustan los cables (yo siempre lo uso con su cable USB y funciona de maravilla).<br/><br/>- Dejo un video en el que muestro el estado actual de la tableta y el lápiz después de más de 3 años de uso full sin problemas, te muestro rápidamente la lámina que menciono para la protección de la superficie y las puntas del lápiz, (en cuanto a la hoja, creo que puede usar cualquiera que sea similar) verás que conservo todas las puntas y también notarás que es el momento de cambiar la punta que venía...</span><span class="cr-translated-review-content aok-hidden"></span>

<span>After poring over reviews for less expensive tablets I finally decided to purchase the more expensive Intuos Pro (medium size). While pricey, it does not disappoint. It suits my needs perfectly as a 3d artist who suffers from wrist and joint pain. I moved from a mouse to a trackball years ago, and while it helped, it did not alleviate the problem. The pen-tablet combo is even better, for while some movements remain repetitive, many are mitigated through the multiple ways of accomplishing similar tasks. I still pull out the trackball when doing simple things like typing/navigating documents etc., but am using the stylus more-and-more for a variety of applications as I become used to it.<br/><br/>PROS:<br/>●  Intuitive settings interface<br/>●  The included stylus is easy on the hands (mine are large, but not huge: long thin fingers)<br/>●  Bluetooth or Type C connection for wireless or wired use (nice when it works)<br/>●  Mid-size tablet is a perfect size for everything I do (the large would be too much for my tasks)<br/>●  Pen comes with several replacement nibs<br/>●  Tablet surface is sensitive and feels natural to write on for me<br/>●  Has a user friendly "Touch" feature that turns it into a giant track-pad with programmable hand gestures (works really well for me)<br/>●  "Touch" feature can be disabled with the flick of a switch<br/>●  On-tablet programmable buttons, as well as pop-up menus for all or select apps<br/>●  The option to replace the standard (medium) drawing surface (smooth, medium, rough)<br/><br/>CONS:<br/>●  Sometimes the driver stops working (so far not often). Pulling its USB and then plugging it back in takes care of this, and when that fails a reboot is necessary--annoying when in the middle of a work-flow.<br/>EDIT: The bluetooth has consistently broken the tablet drivers--so much so that I stopped using the wireless option. It would be a great feature, if it worked without having to restart the system constantly. My bluetooth adapter works without a hitch with my other devices, so the problem seems to be Wacom's drivers. When plugged in (not using bluetooth) the drivers are much more consistent. Apparently Wacom drivers seem to be an issue with other reviewers as well--hopefully these issues are addressed through updates.<br/>●  The side buttons on the new model are stiff, requiring a bit of pressure to toggle/keep toggled. Repetitive tasks are then more difficult, especially when hand fatigue sets in. As a result I find myself using the keyboard for shortcuts with my left hand while working the stylus with my right. Wacom would do well to lighten the mechanical switch, or provide the option for user defined pressure settings.<br/>●  The "Touch" feature can only be disabled through the mechanical side switch. Some applications do not distinguish well between pen and hand input, making the touch feature undesirable when a stylus is necessary. It is a bit annoying to have to physically toggle a switch when one is using keyboard shortcuts, pop-up menus, etc. Wacom would do well to also include a programmable shortcut etc. for touch on/off (I believe the older version of the Intuos had this feature, but without the mechanical switch--which I do like).<br/>●  The included medium grade drawing surface seems to be wearing out my nibs prematurely. If I end up spending a lot on extra nibs I will take the plunge and replace the surface with its smooth variant, but would rather save the money. For now I am carefully refining my used nibs with 1000 grit sandpaper, which works well-enough.<br/><br/>In spite of these annoyances, I am satisfied with this tablet. Hopefully the next permutation by Wacom will be even better (especially driver stability).</span>

<span>I am a long-tome Wacom user, use a tablet always, even as a mouse, and have used them all varations the last 20 years except Cintiq. This 2019/2020 Small Intuos Pro is one of the best i have ever worked on WHEN PLUGGED IN....when using Bluetooth wireless not so much.<br/><br/>PROS: Fantastic upgrade from my Wacom One (CTL-471), way more responsive and agile, movements not as chunky as Wacom One...needed a very small tablet footprint, this Intuos very similar to Wacom One specs (unlike previous Small Intuos version), and now I can rest my drawing hand on the tablet instead of the desk, very comfortable. Nice silky matte finish and enough shortcut buttons for me although i rarely use them. Have not noticed any pen nub wear issues or tablet scratching after 2 months. The stylus itself is surprisingly comfortable to hold/use over long periods of time, and power USB cord super long. Again, the size is amazing, very light, long rubber strips on back to prevent sliding, and no Bluetooth dongles. Touch features a plus but i dont use those much, leave them switched off (actual switch on side of tablet), but its there just in case. GREAT VALUE USED.<br/><br/>CONS: Bluetooth wireless is good when power near 80-90%, but once it gets to 70s it cuts out on my system (Mac Pro 6,1 using Catalina OS, tablet 2 feet away from computer) and needs a recharge to return to wireless. Also drains battery quickly when unplugged on Bluetooth, even when plugged in battery rarely gets to 100%, normally at 92%. Not sure why but very disappointing, was hoping to use wireless but very unreliable, i just have to leave it plugged in i guess. Stylus holder base is ok, shorter and heavier but I liked the old one better, takes up less space. Did not work good initially with Catalina, kept freezing out the cursor, had to restart to unfreeze, but found the fix - i describe the details at bottom of review. VERY EXPENSIVE FOR LIMITED BLUETOOTH/BATTERY LIFE.<br/><br/>OVERALL: definite must-buy if you need a super small responsive tablet with all the latest features. If you need a tablet for steady wireless workflow maybe not worth the upgrade. For $250 this tablet's wireless capabilities should be way more reliable than what it currently is. Honestly should get only 3 stars but the size and cursor response are so amazing.<br/><br/>MAC OS X BUG FIX: So, the cursor would freeze while hover-moving after a certain amount of time, which varied from a few minutes to a few days, very unpredictable. Once it froze only way to move cursor was to hold down pen nib to tablet and move around that way, but then you are click dragging or moving things everywhere, a real nightmare. Unplugging, replugging, turning touch on/off or going bluetooth never fixed it either - only fix was a reboot but then it would happen again and again. HERE IS THE FIX: go into System Preferences &gt; Security &amp; Privacy &gt; Privacy &gt; Input Monitoring &gt; UNCHECK the box next to WacomTabletDriver.app and lock/save changes. THAT FIXED THE CURSOR FREEZES! also, under Accessiblity "com.wacom.IOManager.app" box should be checked, IF not check it. ABSOLUTELY NO INFO ABOUT THIS BUG ON WACOM SITE, DAMNED SHAME, I RETURNED A PERFECTLY GOOD USED TABLET THINKING IT WAS A DUD, BUT WHEN THE NEW ONE DID THE SAME THING I KNEW IT WAS A SOFTWARE ISSUE, LUCKILY FOUND THE FIX....you're welcome Mac users!</span>

<span>I got this Chromebook to replace my last Samsung 11"  Chromebook which I had for about 3.5 years.<br/>The Acer spin 11 was pretty good and I liked it alot. The keyboard worked much better than my Samsung.<br/>That thing has a mind of it's own, I think. You type one word and the Chromebook types up something else..<br/>Expect for this one small problem and it started just after a month or so after I had purchased this.<br/>Once awhile it wouldn't turn back on after I had idling for whatever time it took to be in power saving mode but<br/>It wouldn't turn back on, everytime when this happens I have to press the side power button for about ten seconds to turn it off first then, I'd give it a minute before hitting the same power button again. I hold it just long enough to see the blue light goes on next to power button you just pressed. Oh just out of curiosity, what does the power button do located right top corner? Cause it won't shut the computer off or on. No matter how long you hold the button down. Anyway back to main issue, just awhile I left the Chromebook to visit UPS store and came back, tried to reboot my Chromebook as usual but this time it won't turn on. I tried unplug &amp; replug all the cables like power, HDMI. Man I only had this for about 4-5 months and this happens. My warranty expired as well.... I'm very disappointed.</span>

<span>I like the fact that it's a touchscreen and that you can place in all kinds of different positions to use it as a laptop and tablet without needing anything else. I've had it for close to a year and haven't had any issues at all.<br/> All Chromebooks come with only 8 years of software updates that start at time of manufacture. Mine was brand new but only had 4 left. For me the price made it a no brainier. In 4 years I'll just buy another one.</span>

<span>Okay so I'm going to preface this with I've been on the search for the perfect laptop/chromebook something portable and takes up minimal space for my other half. I did research and this was in the top 10 and it said blizzard white which he likes so I pulled the trigger. When we got it the box says blizzard white but when he opened it the color was the abyss blue and looked like a different model. He still loves it.<br/>I will update when he uses it to see if there is any issues or any likes or dislikes.<br/>It was very disappointing to me that he got the wrong color. I am not sure if the model number is even correct as what the box was saying it should be. I will update if I can find the box the chromebook came in.<br/>What could cause the wrong item to get in the box when the box itself has the right name listed on it?</span>

<span>Lenovo has much better build quality then some of the other cheaper devices in this class.  This is my first chromebook. I have to say I am impressed with the amount of actual work you can do with this thing.  It is VERY versatile.  The performance is above average.  Being able to run Linux with ChromeOS is a huge bonus. If your a former sysadmin you might want to consider this for a utility. The battery life is fantastic.  The performance is good.  Switching between table and laptop mode  is a breeze.  Very happy with this product.</span>

<span>Renewed Lenovo C330 arrived in a huge box clearly marked HEAVY LOAD....someone had a sense of humor being that the whole thing weighed only 4 pounds and you could have put ten of these in boxes inside their big box!<br/><br/>Opening the box the description had said it had cosmetic damage on the sides and gouges on the case, close inspection revealed no damage, it was MINT condition plus the moment I cracked the lid open it was already setting itself up and after a couple of minutes it was ready to go, (try that WINDOWS!) it had syncd itself from my other Chromebook!<br/><br/>The main reason I bought the Lenovo Chromebook was to see first hand how it compared to the two Acer Chromebooks I have, the Acer Spin 713 and the Acer R13, both having a lot of aggrivating issues relating to OS integration.<br/><br/>Acer both 713 and R13 had serious issues with poor sound loudness and quality, image quality is poor even though they were running over 2000 resolution, poor internet speed as both 713 and R13 kept switching to lower speed settings, while virtual keyboard settings in both Acer's suffered from serious lag, and screen fragmentation, Bluetooth pairing was poor with continual drops and no restart if computer woke from sleep and slower overall performance on and offline if used as a tablet.<br/><br/>Lenovo: Suffers from none of the above and excel's in many areas starting with Sound which is LOUD, image quality even with a low 1366 resolution is tight, sharp, and vivid, internet speed stayed where you put it and is quick, virtual keyboard no issues, Bluetooth pairs easily and is ready after sleep with no drops, tablet performance no different, quick and precise.<br/><br/>I agree with some other comments that this is a really handsome computer, the eggshell white with dark grey keys is a real eye catcher, that backed up by a great overall experience and I just noticed the price for these as renewed from the Amazon Warehouse has dropped, you will NOT be dissapointed!<br/>Now for the real twist:  I have bought 9 different Chromebooks over the past couple of months to see if they had that something special that makes them indespensible and I must honestly say that my Fire Tablets 7 through 10 and ONLY the Fire Tablets are much more useful, easy to use, take a ton less space, have much broader uses, easier to take with, typically much higher video, image and sound quality and much faster on the internet and cost waaaay less but give you so much more, so the grand experiment is done and I will be finding some good homes for the Chromebooks.</span>

<span>I bought the iPad 9 because I had decided it was time to upgrade from my iPad Air 2 that I bought about 8 years ago. Honestly, while I could have gotten a different brand that cost less, I was impressed that my tablet had lasted so long. The battery had started to noticeably drain faster but that was the only problem I was having with it. After seeing how well Apple makes their products, I decided to stick with them when making my purchase. So far, the iPad 9 is performing well for me. I enjoy the screen resolution/response and it's bigger than my previous tablet. I mostly watch YouTube, check emails, and use it for things that my phone's screen is too small for. But, I've been wanting to get started with digital drawing and I feel that this tablet will be enough for me to get my feet wet. Maybe I can get another 8 years before upgrading again.</span>
