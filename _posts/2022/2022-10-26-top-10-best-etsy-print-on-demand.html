<span>This book is 51 pages with what looks like a 20 point font and is filled with pictures. I literally read it in 15 minutes. It is the most basic How to Book I have ever read, and I love how to books and have at least 100 of them on my shelf. I am a brand new Etsy-Printful seller and was looking for something that might help me grow my business and learn the ends and outs of Printful. Printful is so easy to use you do not need this book. I could have watched a five minute video on Youtube and learned more. I am extremely disappointed in the author as they could have spent a little more time and made this a great book.</span>

<span>I would rate this ebook more 3.5 stars than 4 because this is a very basic starting reference point for setting up with Printful.  Most of the info you can find within Printful's own training. It seems this is a promotion book for the author's other books.</span>

<span>This book was concise and full of fantastic information for getting started with print on demand sites! It was just what I needed to push to get started!<br/><br/>However, and the reason it’s not 5 starts, is that it’s not actually a kindle book, it appears to just be an uploaded PDF. That means I couldn’t read it on my actual kindle, the links did not work, and no highlighting/bookmarking. All of the content itself was awesome.</span>

<span>This book is very personable- the authors are enthusiastic to make you successful, supportive in they’re approach &amp; understanding of beginners by explaining things clearly &amp; concisely. It’s like they’ve been in my head all the times I’ve thought about quitting my 9-5 to sell full-time on Etsy, what I love to create, &amp; how I’ve struggled with the fear of not knowing how to do it right. There’s so much valuable information in here that I never would have thought of. Not only do they tell you the how, step by step, but also the why, which is why it’s so easy to digest &amp; commit to memory. I haven’t finished it yet, but so far, it’s super comprehensive &amp; intuitively laid out in an order that makes sense. If you haven’t opened your shop yet, like me, I wouldn’t until you read this book! Good job ladies!</span>

<span>...and this book is no exception. She's done extensive research on St. Expidite and the book is chock full of essential knowledge that can't be found else where. I'm a huge fan of Denise Alvarado so can't be unbiased and learned much from this book. However, there are some missing words, even in the prayers, which were bothersome and took me sometime to figure out how the prayers were meant to be said. Not all that difficult and certainly doesn't change my giving this book 5 stars, but for people with only vague knowledge of St. Expedite, it could be a problem .</span>

<span>I very much love this coloring book. I really didn't know much about Molly's work until seeing this book. It is only the 2nd fantasy book in my collection so far and I plan on purchasing more of her books in the future. There are different levels within the book. Most are fairly easy. The paper is thinner, but it's all one sided. I cut out my pages to be sure I didn't damage other pages, however, you could just used a piece of card stock or thin card board in between the pages as well. I recommend this to those who like the fantasy-faeries-magical type. If you like the coloring pages, I HIGHLY recommend looking at her wonderfully brilliant finished pieces as well on her Facebook and Etsy pages! (I bought this book on my own. No one paid for my opinion.)</span>

<span>Molly Harrison is quickly becoming one of my favorite artists for coloring. this book has the perfect mix of simple and more detailed designs. Every image has endless possibilities for coloring 😊<br/><br/>The paper is good. One sided pages so you don't have to sacrifice images. If you use markers you will want a buffer page between images(I use a sheet of card stock) so it won't bleed through.<br/><br/>I can't wait to get more of her books!!</span>

<span>Sell to Excel: The Art and Science of Personal Selling is one of those book that highlights and reminds us of what we already intuitively know and practice.  This book comes from the perspective of selling to other businesses not of selling retail or similar environments.  But you can easily apply it however you see fit.  My purpose for reading this book was to see if I could apply this information to my personal life when it comes to creating new relationships and cultivating lasting friendships.  In essence, I wanted to see if I was able to 'sell myself' to people.<br/>There are many points and guidelines in this book that help do this as well as teaching you the best practices to sell to businesses.  While this is not literature that is a self-help, one can use the methods described to better their interactions with people they meet, both new and old.  Handling objections is a big one that applies to sales alone and not necessarily a quest to establishing new partnerships unless of course it is in the business world.  As mentioned earlier, the tactics in this book are or should be already intuitively known.  Handling objections, for example, should be done before the sale even begins.  Know your product, create relationships, asking for feedback, following up after the sale, personal appearance, and selling on emotion are just some of the many topics in this book.  My favorite part was of negotiation.  To me, this is the thrill of the beginning of the closing process.  This part illustrates many aspects like body language and price agreement to name just a couple.  There is great detail in this section of the art of negotiation as well as each section.<br/>While I went into this book looking to better myself, I came out with a better understanding and a kind of reminder that sales is more than just a 'pitch' and a smile.  It is a mindset.  This is a good book for any sales person, whether you are selling cars at the retail level, pharmaceuticals to doctors, or land and supplies to big corporations.  The fundamentals that are within help with any struggles you may be facing and assist with taking the fear out of selling whatever it is that needs to be sold.<br/>Good book in easy to understand language and a quick read. Recommend to anyone curious about selling or whoever desires to get to that next level in their selling abilities.</span>

<span>This book is just what I needed. I don't know much about sales at all, but this book has it all! It is very complete and thorough. Every aspect of sales that I could want to know about is in here. And it is all explained in a way that makes sense. The author gives step-by-step procedures to follow. I am confident that I can actually succeed in sales with this book to guide me.<br/><br/>First, the author explains the basics of selling, such as identifying customer requirements, handling objections, influencing, negotiating, assertiveness, making sales presentations, and more. Then he goes into more of the “art” of selling, covering such subjects as using metaphors, asking questions, anchoring, reframing, mirroring, storytelling, active listening, likability, selling on value, selling to the “old brain”, networking, voicemail, and handling rejection.<br/><br/>What I really like about this book is that the author is not trying to get you to be “salesy”. Just the opposite. Customers don't respond well to someone who is trying to run over them and force them to buy. Instead, he emphasizes that you need to build a rapport with your customers, listen to them, and genuinely try to help them solve their problems. He also tells you how to negotiate without antagonizing your customer. You can be assertive and have boundaries, while still listening and responding well to your customers.<br/><br/>I feel that there is so much material in this book that you could practice one thing a week and still be practicing new sales techniques years later. Each technique that he teaches will help a person to be a better salesperson. I am so glad I found this book, and I will be studying it and re-reading it often.</span>

<span>In his book Sell to Excel: The Art and Science of Personal Selling, Asif Zaidi employs psychology to show how one can become successful at selling their product, service or ideas. He begins by discussing the value personal selling which helps build personal relationships and gives you the opportunity to physically gauge the customer’s reception to you and what you have to offer.<br/><br/>The author states that, “The foundation of successful selling is how well you listen". In personal selling this is a key point that the he goes in depth to address. By giving the customer your undivided attention with active listening, you begin to gain their confidence and trust. Getting to know who your customer and their business is essential. First it is of utmost importance to learn about the business itself, its industry, and understand the value of your product or service to your customer. Secondly, be ready to handle questions and objections to what you’re offering. Zaida does a fine job of teaching how to reframe an objection or a negative vibe by turning it around to something positive that will benefit both you and the customer.<br/><br/>While many customers may resist change, you have an opportunity to become an agent of change when you connect with the decision makers and influencers in a company and make a strong presentation of your product or service. Zaida gives detailed advice on how to prepare and make a selling presentation. An interesting point I learned was during presentations it helps to use case studies based on your experience. For example, by giving them an example of how you managed to turn a financial pain point into a return on investment with a proper resolution they may feel that you genuinely have their interest at heart. This is also another form of reframing an objection and keeping the customer engaged and more apt to do business with you. The final chapters address other important issued such as, networking, using voicemail properly, and handling rejection.<br/><br/>This book is a must have for entrepreneurs and would be very helpful for anyone who is involved in a business or service.</span>

<span>"Sell to Excel: The Art and Science of Personal Selling," is the perfect companion for individuals and companies that want to not only sell, but to sell well.<br/><br/>Asif Zaidi's helpful guide is split into two parts. Part I, The Basics of Personal Selling, starts with a detailed definition of personal selling, then offers both the benefits and the challenges of it. According to the writer, "Personal selling is the process of interacting with prospects face-to-face with the intent of selling a product or service." He lists and defines eleven stages of making a sale and offers four steps in a buying process, all of which are customer centric. The writer makes it clear throughout this section (and throughout the book) that the customer is the centerpoint of selling. He is straight to the point with this fact and repeats himself over and over in different ways about just how important the customer is. This section is about the science of personal selling.<br/><br/>In part II, The Art of Personal Selling, Zaidi gives specific details of how to sell effectively. He points out that figurative speech such as metaphors are best when trying to describe products or services. He says that effective salespeople know how to blend language, facts, numbers, and demonstration. Metaphors in particular are effective as they connect, make something complicated more simple, and can make the sellers message easy, vivid, and clear. Zaidi enforces his concept that the customer is the most important factor in this section as well. This section is all about the art of building strong relationships with customers in order to make "the sell."<br/><br/>This how to guide provided a great resource and information for me. I have worked in retail, but I always struggled with making sales goals. This book allowed me to understand the importance of getting the customer to trust in me by making a connection with them and being honest with them. It gave me tips to be a better salesperson.<br/><br/>I recommend this guide to anyone who is either selling a product, selling a service, or just trying to get comfortable selling in general.</span>
