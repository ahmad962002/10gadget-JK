<span>It's worked marvelously since I bought in back in February. I picked up all of the extras as well, including the tripod. My girlfriend uses it in the riding arena to view her horse's movements and it has worked perfectly. It fell over last week (not the first time) and one of the interior parts snapped. Pivo's customer service asked a few questions, required a few photos of the damage/defective part, and had a replacement back to me by the end of the week. They kept me informed throughout the review and were pleasant through the experience. I can't recommend them or the Pico enough.</span>

<span>Needed a device to help with shooting horse videos.  Perfect little item for that purpose.  Had my doubt for the price about how good this was going to perform but the past several times out it has been flawless.  HAVE to be sure the phone gets a lock though as if you do not, it will disappoint.  For the money and the intended purpose (filming horse riding) it fits the bill in my book!</span>

<span>Tried to use it to track me teaching my dog to do tricks. About half the time, it lost tracking. Being farther from the camera helps, but not by much. It also makes the phone zoom digitally (poorer quality) when it has optical zoom (S22 Ultra).</span>

<span>Great piece of tech but not for me.<br/><br/>Highly recommend you test one at a retailer before buying your first gimbal.<br/>for the content creator, this is great for IRL live streaming or getting some great stabilized shots for B-roll.<br/><br/>My Cons: for a quick setup, you have to remove your phone case for the phone clip to hold your phone securely. software app gives warning if your phone isnt centered. when centered the phone clip is pressing against your volume or lock button. Phone battery drains so you need to keep charging cabled tethered to external charger.<br/><br/>Pros: small, plug and play, foldable. app is easy to navigate and tutorial is a quick 3 min lesson.</span>

<span>I understand they wanted to make this more foldable - but I found that coming from an Osmo Mobile 2 (OM2 from this point on) took quite a bit of re-learning how to hold it.  The OM2 was able to rotate on its vertical axis to where you could hold it down to the ground and it was able to fully rotate to remain level.  The OM5 requires you to hold it vertical- the rotate the arm sideways in order to allow the ground shots.  If you push it too hard past the limit (which is pretty easy)  the gimbal will violently try to center itself before going limp and requiring you to recenter it again.  The OM2 didn't have this problem as I could easily and naturally hold the gimbal low and then back up while keeping my arm in the same position.<br/><br/>I also found the DJI Mimo app confusing to use as compared to the OM2's "DJI Go" version.  I dont know why DJI has to release separate apps for their OM gimbals.  The functionality and easyeof use of the former app was superior.  The Mimo app is clunky and difficult to access some of the features (like the 3x3 shots...etc)  I find myself having to squint at the small white icons and have almost given up using it completely.  I prefer using the standard camera built into the phone for simplicity.<br/><br/>The OM5 has the finger trigger to lock the gimbal from auto rotating with wrist twisting - this is helpful.  However, the OM2 double tap to disable was much easier to use.  I find the wrist rotation of the gimbal on the OM5 to be jerky at best, especially when rotating the gimbal to the side for lower shots.  The gimbal finger controls and wrist movement now change the axis based on the direction it is being held.  Good, yes, but awkward and requires learning with a little frustration.<br/><br/>In the end- the OM5 size is great!  I just miss the simplicity of the older versions even though they were physically larger.  I think a lot of these issues can be fixed with updates or maybe somebody with more patience.  Coming from the OM2, this requires more "training" than I expected.</span>

<span>Where do I start, how about the beginning.<br/>1. The first unit arrived damaged, unable to attach the unit to the tripod as the threads were damaged on the unit..it appeared to be a used item so quality control is lacking.<br/>2. Once I got the new unit, the website description called "Sky-Watcher Star Adventurer Photo Kit" indicates it is what you need to point your camera at the sky to take photos...not really, you also really need the equilateral wedge which does not come with the unit.<br/>3. Bought the equilateral wedge, get it al setup and ready to go...not so fast. the software needed to run the unit will not launch on my phone.<br/>4. Reviews of the software on google play are really low and others are experiencing the same issue. Others state that there is "beta" software on the company's website that does work, I was unable to locate it.<br/>5. Called customer support, had to leave a message as there is no one there to speak with live, never got a return call.<br/>6. the documentation that comes with the unit is horrendous. Appears to be written by an eight grader.<br/>7. Save your money, the unit seems to be sturdy, but I am unable to validate if it actually works as the other barriers are preventing me from trying it out.</span>

<span>This thing works perfectly, exactly as advertised.  Really awesome to take 400 pictures of the Orion nebula and have every single one perfectly centered in the frame with no start trails at all.  It works surprisingly well even with a 300mm telephoto lens pointed at deep space objects (see photo).<br/><br/>Some advice:  You need the latitude base, adjusted to your latitude - it makes polar alignment a lot easier.  I also find the dec bracket and counter weight to be helpful with my bigger lenses.  You also *must* have a sturdy tripod that can handle this thing's weight plus all of your camera gear.  My lighter tripod doesn't hold everything steady enough and the results aren't as good.  Polar alignment takes some practice but now I find I can do it in 2-3 minutes top.</span>

<span>I used it on a single night so far and it works like a charm. There are different modes and I wish there was more guidance available on how to use each. The booklet and online videos are all targeted towards the astrophotography mode only</span>

<span>Really nice and small tracker, works great with easy polar alignment. It only took me 2 minutes to do a polar align and I can track stars without trail for at least 30 seconds. Use SAM console app to find where the Polaris should be in the polar scope and then adjust accordingly, that's it.  Done! I did a quick test with it using my cheap 50 dollar tripod at my backyard in a heavy light pollution area.  Works fine. Gonna take it to mountains this weekend to test out.</span>
