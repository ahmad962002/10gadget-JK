<div class="slideshow-container">
<blockquote><em><div class="a-row a-spacing-small review-data"><span class="a-size-base review-text review-text-content" data-hook="review-body">
<span>This is considered a budget computer, but for us computer geeks, this is the base for several "premium" models. I can't really write a review of the computer out of the box because before I ever turned it on, I installed a 2nd RAM card, then when I booted it, I signed into my account which changed it from Windows 10 S mode to Windows 10 Pro since I have several Windows 10 Pro product keys associated with my account.<br/><br/>With that being said, this computer outperforms what it is meant to do. Is this going to be the strongest computer you can buy? No, not at all. However, this computer has edited large videos for me in minutes, I can use my music notation software on it with no lag or freezing (Sibelius), and it does actually process games at the higher resolutions. I've tested games as demanding as Forza Horizon 4 and it, surprisingly, performs with no issues. It does run hotter, of course, but not exactly "hot". Heavier usage draws down the battery, but that can be said for literally any electronic device.<br/><br/>I purchased this to replace my well-aged HP G60 whatever model that was that I purchased 12 years ago and just kept updating. Up until around July 2020, it was still up to specs to work from home, something I actually bought that computer for 12 years ago. Finally, an update to most of the work at home platforms finally rendered that old beast useless. Ironically, I used the stimulus check from back then (2008) to purchase that computer. With that laptop in mind, I premium laptop to me is one that I can upgrade and repair easily. The HP G60 line did that quite well. Now here in 2020, I purchased one of these for someone else at first. During setup, I noticed the slot to add another SSD, I added the second RAM chip for that one as well since I already knew about that, but I also noticed how easy it was to work on it. We booted it up, put a Windows 10 Pro key on it as well, and from the start, I was impressed with the performance. I was so impressed that I bought myself one.<br/><br/>This thing is super lightweight. The keyboard does have slight smaller keys which takes all of about 20 seconds to get used to. This is because it fit a full number pad on the right of the main keyboard, something that is a must for me with a laptop. One thing I absolutely don't find at this price range is the backlit keyboard.<br/><br/>Spoiler alert: with the backlight turned on for the keyboard, your battery time can be reduced by as much as 50%. You really don't need it if you're used to typing on pretty much any keyboard, but it's nice when you do need it at night in the middle of a shift. The button to turn it on and off is located pretty much at the center of the top row (F keys). Just to the left of that is the button to turn off the track pad. Very nice placement on both of those.<br/><br/>The graphics seems to use a combination of resources that gives you 5 GB reserved just for graphics processing. Not bad at all. This must be what pushes it to be able to do a lot more than expected for this price.<br/><br/>It's nice going into the Microsoft Store to check the system requirements on games (Halo series, Forza Horizon, etc) and not see any red indicating the computer doesn't meet the requirements.<br/><br/>For working from home, this is excellent for those resources that might require a proprietary desktop that you have to load and run via USB. It also has a built in ethernet port, which is usually required for those particular work from home platforms, but it also performs flawlessly on the 5 GHz wifi networks for the rest.<br/><br/>As a digital nomad, I also have to upload and edit and create videos. This thing surprisingly gets through Adobe and other applications with ease and renders videos quite fast.<br/><br/>This was supposed to be a quick purchase for me to replace my aged out HP and then I'd get another good laptop later on, but I'm probably just going to buy a couple more of these.<br/><br/>*Update*<br/>I've noticed two things that improved performance. First, I downloaded the full AMD Radeon Software (it comes with the "lite" version) and that opened up a lot of performance tweaks on both the cpu and gpu.<br/><br/>Also, I'm noticing the battery time listed must be an overall average. When I'm just browsing, watching a few Youtube videos in the browser, and doing stuff like writing product reviews, with the brightness turned down to the lowest setting and with the backlit keyboard off, I seem to get between 9 and 10 hours of battery life from a full charge. Not sure if that's normal for this device, but it's what I keep noticing. Make sure you also turn off bluetooth and location and all that other stuff you're likely not using because those can draw the battery down quickly. When I have the brightness up, keyboard lights on, playing games with the Xbox controller connected via bluetooth, working (headset in, running work platform software), the battery time can be as low as 5 hours from a full charge.<br/><br/>I don't allow any sleep or hibernate functions. Those tend to kill a hard drive. There's nothing I'm ever doing that can't just be saved so I can properly shut the computer down. Sleep and hibernate modes can also do some strange things to batteries, usually causing software glitches that can wreck even the best batteries. They can also cause data fragmentation... all in all, I just don't use those functions on any computer, and for all I know, it could contribute to the better luck I have with laptop batteries and having never had hard drive failure.</span>

<span>Biggest case of buyers remorse in my life. Always bought HP with Intel hardware but figured with the reviews for this Acer Aspire 5 with AMD Ryzen 5 and Radeon graphics why not explore unfamiliar territory and see what the hype was about in the reviews. This Acer Aspire 5 for $489 Brand New shipped to the door I was astonished the laptop didn't come with an actual user manual. Was even more pissed that you can not setup and use this without first connecting to a WiFi network.<br/>For those who don't care about WiFi connections and just want a localized laptop with out brand manufacturers spying on you and gathering data your SOL. Wanted to read the user manual to see there if there was a way around this but for $489 you have to have the internet and download it. After I connected to the internet against my will the computer restarted and entered an error message that an error was encountered and it needed to restart. It did this twice with no luck just blue screens. It then went to diagnose repair screen attempting to diagnose the failure to start up with no luck only option was to shut down. After shutdown it actually loaded back up the and the very next screen was demanding to log in with a Microsoft account or sign up for one. Now there are ways around this with HP laptops. All you have to do is say no internet connection at 1st use and then you can sign in with a local account instead of logging in with a Microsoft account. For those who may not understand why this is an issue for some is when you login with a Microsoft account no matter what settings on privacy you think you can control you have zero privacy. Microsoft can see anything any everything you do on your laptop down to the keyboard typing and all activity. Oh well I know how to fix that later and I sign on with a Microsoft account. Finally get to windows and do what I always do download Firefox and Uninstall Microsoft edge. I restart the laptop to the same cycle of error loading operating system and attempt to diagnose that fails. Shut down the laptop and it loads again. Finally found out that anytime you restart the laptop whatsoever it cycles back to the same blue screens of error loading windows and diagnosing. Performed a factory restore back to complete factory settings so it was like the first time I opened the laptop up no difference. Still doing this cycle of device ran into problem gathering info, then diagnosing PC, PC cant be repaired, shut down, loads till the next time it restarts. Being upset is putting it mildly. I'm 38 and have been using computers and fixing them since I was 12, this is not a foreign language to me. This Acer Aspire 5 with AMD processor and graphics is total garbage. Brand new and it don't even work properly right out of the freakin box. I factory restored this thing 3 times and supposedly this wipes the hard drive completely and saves nothing but yet every time it re-installs it still has my name has the device owner. I started growing aggravated with HP but Acer is a complete joke. The display sucks also. Everything looks fine till you open a windows system or program property window then it's so blurry you think u have something in your eye, played with resolution and display settings and everything is clear and fine until you open a windows properties window and you can barely make out the letters. Same windows on my 3, 5 and 7 year old HP laptops zero issues but this brand new $500 Acer laptops display stops wanting to work properly over a properties window??? Who ever designed this model and it components and said yeah let's ship that out to the unexpected consumer needs banished from working in the information technology field. I wanted to get product support from Acer to address this issue but I couldn't even register this product through the preinstalled Acer Care Center software or their website, everytime I tried it gave me an error message and to try again later. So if you know a little about computers and want to fix a Brand New laptop yourself to get it to work properly I think you will be very pleased with the performance of this machine with the AMD components.<br/><br/>UPDATE: Found the fix for above issues. Don't use the operating system or ghost recovery drive programmed into the laptop. Download windows media creation tool and perform a full wipe and installation using the USB flash drive on startup.  The install will only load windows 10 but after 2-3 days windows update will automatically install windows 11.  I used Driver Booster 9 to update all the drivers for the hardware which always works flawlessly, best part its free and fast and has 1 click upgrades for all drivers. After a bunch of headache and wasted time I'm pretty impressed and happy with the hardware components. I bench-marked and stress tested this PC to some remarkable results. Too bad it couldn't work properly right out of the box, someone at Acer really dropped the ball. What I like about this Acer Aspire A515 45 is that it has 2 memory slots and comes with 8GB preinstalled and is up-gradable to 32 GB. The Graphics card takes half of the preinstalled 8GB and dedicates it to graphics processing which is nice in a way but its a give and take. I had a 4GB card of DDR4 with a 2666MHz clock frequency and threw that in the unused memory slot.  I was unsure how the PC would benchmark after this because the memory preinstalled was 3200MHz and that basically bottle necks the original memory card from 3200MHz down to 2666MHz but it still performed better than without it. Ideally you want to match the memory frequency with what is preinstalled to avoid this but like I said I had this 2666Mhz card already. In the near future I will match the preinstalled memory card with an after market 8GB DDR4 card with a 3200MHz frequency as well as matching the rank of the card (single rank/double rank) and all other specs. Ideally you want both slots to match down to the last detail including the memory capacity to prevent bottle necks between the processor and the motherboards ability to communicate with the memory. When I had the back off this the 2nd memory card slot was right there and accessibility but the original wasn’t visible so If you want to replace the original memory card it appears you have to remove the mother board and flip it over to get to the original used memory slot. While I was installing the added memory I scene that it has a space for an extra additional hard drive which is really great! I have a 500 GB Samsung 870 EVO SSD hard drive in one of my older HP laptops that will be going in this next. I thought I was gonna have to buy different brackets and sata cable to install the Samsung Evo SSD but they were included in the box with all the screws as well! If you buy a model with Intel products that stuff will be inside the laptop taped where the second hard drive goes. After setting up the additional Samsung hard drive so it was recognized by the laptop I used Samsung's "Magician" software to benchmark both drives and was astonished that the western digital SSD was 3 times faster than my Samsung EVO 870. My Samsung was doing almost 600MB a second read/speed and the WD was almost 2GB per second! My fastest laptop before this Acer was a HP Notebook 15 with an dual core Intel i3 processor. That HP ran me the same price as this Acer 2 years ago. It worked great but its a night and day difference between this Acer for multi tasking and for video and graphics capabilities. That HP didn’t have the extra bay for an additional hard drive either. I’m very pleased with this Acer after I removed the pre-installed operating system and software.</span>

<span>Okay, so full disclosure.  I'm a computer repair technician and I bought the base model (Ryzen 3 w/4GB of RAM and a 120GB SSD).  As a technician (meaning someone who can upgrade and repair computers), I'd give this a 3.5/5.  As an end user however, I really don't know who this is supposed to be made for.  It's woefully underpowered and comes with a crippled OS.  If you don't mind those things then there are a lot of cheaper options.  If you DO mind those things then I hope you know what you're doing because it's going to take a LOT of time and effort to get this thing usable.<br/><br/>First off, S mode.  It's basically a Chromebook in S mode.  Again, you can get a Chromebook (or even another S mode device) for much cheaper than this so I don't know why you'd choose this one.  Putting that aside however, most people say that you can just get out of S mode and you'll have a normal computer, right?  Well, in THEORY that's true.  In practice however, Windows 10S likes to randomly and inexplicably revert to S mode without warning.  As a technician I see these S mode computers all the time that have reverted back to S mode with no way to go back to Windows 10 Home except to do a complete wipe and reload of the OS.  If you want to PERMANENTLY get out of S Mode, you have to get out of S mode, then download a copy of Windows 10 from the Microsoft website and make a USB flash drive with Windows 10.  Then you have to open up the flash drive, go into the Sources folder and add an ei.cfg file with the following parameters:<br/><br/>[EditionID]<br/>Home<br/>[Channel]<br/>Retail<br/><br/>Once you do that you can boot from the flash drive, erase the drive, and install Windows 10 Home from scratch.  If you don't add the ei.cfg file it will just reinstall Windows 10S again.  This is not something a normal end user would be able to do, but it's necessary if you want to be able to feel secure that the thing isn't going to just randomly revert back to S mode and become unusable.<br/><br/>Secondly, the specs.  4GB of RAM and a 120GB SSD?  Seriously, Acer?  The last time 4GB of RAM was standard on laptops was like 2012.  I could see if this were a $150 computer, but at $366 it should have at LEAST 8GB of RAM and a 250GB SSD.  I upgraded mine to 8GB of RAM, a 500GB NVMe SSD, and a 2TB 2.5" hard drive.  It's been close to a decade since I've personally owned a computer with a hard drive but it's nice to have that ability.  I also appreciate the fact that they include the mounting hardware and even the screws in a separate bag.<br/><br/>Third, the screen.  The screen is okay, but there's a major flaw that took me a while to figure out.  The screen will dim if you unplug the charger and run it on battery.  That's normal, right?  Well what's NOT normal is that AMD has a setting called "Vari-Bright."  If this is turned on and you unplug the computer, the display doesn't just dim but it also loses contrast/color.  It's hard to describe it but it looks like crap.  Unfortunately the AMD Radeon software doesn't get installed through Windows Update and it's not on Acer's website so you have to go directly to AMD in order to download it.  Unfortunately that also means that AMD is going to install the latest drivers on your device, which haven't been tested and certified compatible by Acer.  Chances are it will be fine, but it's always best to use the latest driver from the computer manufacturer (in this case, Acer) rather than going to the chip manufacturer.  There are a million and one potential compatibility problems with new drivers, which is why they need to be tested by the manufacturer, who may update other drivers to compensate.  This isn't possible if you want to turn off "Vari-Bright" because you're forced to install the latest drivers from AMD.<br/><br/>The next problem is with the keyboard backlight.  It turns off after 30 seconds and it won't turn back on again if you move the mouse.  You MUST touch a key on the keyboard to turn it on again.  There's a setting in the BIOS to disable the keyboard backlight timeout, but it doesn't have any effect.  Speaking of which, this computer shipped with an older BIOS revision (1.10).  I upgraded to the latest BIOS revision (1.11) but it didn't fix the keyboard backlight timeout problem.  Looking online it seems that a LOT of people are having this problem and not only with this model of Acer.  Apparently, Acer doesn't care about this problem.  I almost want to return it for this reason, but I really need another computer so I guess I'll keep it.  If I hadn't been able to resolve the screen brightness problem this would have been going back.<br/><br/>The final issue is the battery life.  If all you're doing is reading articles this MIGHT be able to get you 4 hours of battery life.  If you're watching videos or you have a lot of stuff open, you'll be lucky to get 2-3 hours.  I mean, all manufactures overestimate their battery life to make their products look good, but this laptop doesn't last much longer than my 10 year old HP.<br/><br/>In conclusion, I stand by my initial statement.  I truly don't know who this computer is for.  If you add the cost of the base computer ($366), plus the 500GB SSD ($60), the RAM ($45), and the 2TB hard drive ($80), you're left with a total cost of $551, and there are a lot better computers out there at that price point.  There's an 11th gen i5 15" HP laptop on here for $599 with over TWICE the processing power, a 250GB SSD, and 8GB of RAM.  It also has space for a secondary hard drive if you need to upgrade that in the future.  If you're okay with an underpowered laptop (4GB RAM, small SSD) with a crippled OS (Windows 10S) you can get one for $150 and save yourself $200.<br/><br/>I mean, I wouldn't call this thing a "nice" laptop.  It only has a single USB 3 port (the other two, including the one on the RIGHT side are USB 2.0 - that's right, a technology that debut in April of 2000 which means it's even older than Windows XP!).  It feels cheap/flimsy.  Battery life is mediocre.  It's basically a disposable laptop at a non-disposable price.  If this laptop was $150 - $200 I wouldn't be so critical of it, but whether you're looking for a cheap Chromebook type laptop or you want a real laptop that you can upgrade yourself, you can do so much better by going with something else.  I'm only keeping it because I've put so much time and effort into it and it's easier than returning it and starting over.<br/><br/>The only person I can see that this would be suited for would be someone with a very limited budget that wants to be able to upgrade it over time vs. spending the $550 upfront.  But if they knew how to do all this computer stuff, chances are they'd have a better income and therefore a higher budget.  Maybe a student or someone just entering the workforce?  I dunno.<br/><br/>I must say though, I'm really liking having a secondary drive in a laptop again.  It helps if I need to wipe it out because I don't have to worry about backing up the data since it's on the second hard drive.  But again, there are other computers with this capability.  If you can afford it, the $599 HP with the 11th gen i5 is a great buy.  I haven't personally purchased that computer but after doing all this, I wish I had.</span>

<span>The Acer Aspire 15 has been a super great laptop. It's probably one of the best tech purchases I have ever made and I'm an IT guy. I paid about $350 USD for this one and am very happy with the purchase. The last time I was searching for a Laptop I returned 5 laptops before I was satisfied so I'm pretty picky. This was for my wife but I use it at night when I'm not in my office sometimes.<br/><br/>Storage &amp; Upgrades: Although it only comes with 128gb SSD &amp; 4gb RAM it's no big deal for about $100 you can upgrade to 20gb RAM and 2tb HDD + 128gb SSD. I love that you can run dual drives. 1 SSD + 1 HDD. I added a 2TB HDD for Data Storage for $50, it came with the bracket in the box, and it didn't void the warranty, like on my LG Gram. The 128gb SSD is functioning as a Boot Drive. I also added a 16gb module for about $50 and now have 20gb RAM. The upgrades were pretty straightforward and you can use normal small screwdrivers.<br/><br/>Performance: It boots up super fast, maybe 10 seconds to reach the sign in screen and 2 seconds to log in. Web pages and programs load quickly. We use it for Web browsing, Word, PowerPoint &amp; Excel. I'm not doing video editing or high performance gaming on this but it runs almost as fast as my i5 LG Gram that cost $1500 with all SSD drives. It doesn't get too warm but we do have it on a fan stand, but I don't usually plug it in because for some reason the USB keeps powering the fan after it powers down, and I can't find a BIOS setting to turn this off. I notice that it gets a little warm when sitting directly on a table. I usually can't hear the fan at all. Sometimes you can hear it kick on when you open up 15 tabs and a bunch of apps.<br/><br/>Screen: The screen is really nice too. It's 1080 Full HD so you don't see the pixels like on a normal 15" Standard HD screen. I think it's average brightness but we use it indoors so it's plenty bright for our needs.<br/><br/>Keyboard: I love the Keyboard, it's much better than the keyboard on my LG Gram, and just as good as the best keyboards I have tested in BestBuy from Lenovo. It's wonderful to type on. It's backlit as well so that's nice plus. And I love the Number Pad, even though the number pad is a little skinner than the other keys.<br/><br/>Fingerprint ID: It's super fast and I didn't know how much I would love it!<br/><br/>Speakers: The speakers are fine. They are loud enough to watch YouTube videos and the news but it won't compete with a home stereo system.<br/><br/>Ports: It has plenty of full size ports: 3 USB, 1 USB C, 1 Full HDMI a headphone jack and even a RJ-45 Ethernet Port! I hate dongles so it's nice that you don't need one for this laptop. I would have liked to see a MicroSD reader but my wife doesn't SD Cards it so it's no big deal for her.<br/><br/>Window 11: It comes with Windows 11s but is very easy to switch to standard Windows 11. I was a little concerned about this and it almost made me not go for this laptop. But it's no big deal, as soon as you try to install something "non Microsoft" like Google Chrome it says something like, "If you want to install non-Microsoft software, you have to switch to full Windows 11 mode. Are you sure? You will loose all the exclusive Microsoft Security with Windows 11s Mode." But you just click, "Yes" and it switches, it may require a reboot but I can't remember.<br/><br/>Battery: The battery is average. We usually leave it plugged in on the desk but the few times that we have used it without a battery we used it for a few hours and it remained at 70% battery. Windows 11 doesn't estimate the time remaining so I really don't know for sure how long it would last. I'd guess it would go from 100% to 10% in about 5-6 hours for Netflix, YouTube or web browsing or MS Office apps.<br/><br/>Again, I really love this laptop. I keep telling my wife how impressed I am with the performance, storage upgrade options, keyboard, screen, etc. She doesn't really care that much as long as it works fast and does what she wants so I decided I had to tell all of you Amazon people that this is a great laptop for 95% of normal people who just want something that works well and is a good price. I highly recommend the acer aspire 15 and would buy it again, no regrets!</span>

<span>This is my first Chromebook, and I've been using it for two days.  The battery life is amazing so far; it does appear to be 10 hours. Reading the reviews, it seems like a wide range of experiences, and I feel fortunate that mine works well so far.<br/><br/>It was very easy to set up. I saw 11.5 in the description, but the actual display screen is 10 inches. It isn't a touch screen, and the keys are dark gray, not black. This was an impulse purchase after getting a new laptop a few days ago. My 6 year old Dell would work no longer, and I got an expensive gaming laptop. It was my second one, but I was not expecting it to get so hot, with a noisy fan. The battery life is about an hour. To feel more comfortable, I wanted a Chromebook for email, YouTube, and Amazon videos. So, this is doing what I want it to.<br/>I will likely get more used to having no delete key, instead the alt+backspace key is used for that function.  I was surprised when my bookmark bar appeared with bookmarks from 2013 on. I've deleted many of them in the bookmark manager.<br/>My main dissatisfaction is the disappearing vertical scroll bar. In some emails, you can select "view in<br/>browser". I would be more frustrated if I didn't have the laptop available. There might be a fix for that; I haven't researched yet.<br/>I purchased mine when it was 52% off, which is worth it.  Buying electronics is risky. I've been very disappointed in the past, which is why I'm relieved and accepting of the machine I got.<br/>Almost everything has become more expensive, and reasonable expectations seem to be in order. With two days use, I'm not regretting my purchase.</span>

<span>My job is entirely Google based.  I bought this as a second work computer because my company laptop is a Thinkpad and it's heavy.  I just wanted to leave that at home and have a nice sleek backup for any work tasks I'd need to do in a pinch out of the house.  I couldn't be more pleased with this.  It's light, fast, and the battery life is fantastic.  Lenovos are known for having great keyboards and this is the best one I've used on a small laptop.  It also doesn't look or feel cheap.  The only thing that shows 'budget' is the screen, as it won't blow you away.  But it's still very solid and surprisingly good from the side, where most screens in this price range are garbage viewed from an angle.  If you are in the market for a laptop, and you are in the probably 95% of the public that absolutely doesn't really need an $800 laptop for what they use it for, rush out and buy this one while the price is still insane.</span>

I'm planning to get another one for Black Friday if the price is good enough, because I love this one so much (I[m planning to have an indoor chromebook and an outdoor chromebook). The screen is a bit iffy, but it's good enough. I use this one more than I do my $700 tablet. I don't do anything heavy with it, so this is perfect for my needs.</span>

<span>This computer is a good deal for its price and It is well refurbished. It came with new windows 11 and was completely restored to be like new. Mine crashed or had some technical issues within the first week of use, I’m sure could have been resolved with tech support but I was in a rush with a time frame and didn’t have time to wait for a replacement or for the company to answer back as o bought mine for school purposes. Overall decent computer for price and to be refurbished.</span>

<span>So far this laptop seems decent. Manage you’re expectations. You can’t buy a mid-range gaming laptop and expect all the best. I’ve yet to try some of the more demanding games. But for the games I play these days, like Fortnite, Apex, Rust, R6 Siege, Subnautica, and No Man’s Sky, it’s performing pretty well.<br/><br/>I will say one thing negative: in the pictures, the USB-C port shows the Thunderbolt icon. When I received my laptop, the Thunderbolt icon was missing and only showed the normal USB icon. I was excited for the thunderbolt port but alas the port is not Thunderbolt. This cost them a star on my review simply because having it in the pictures is misleading and they should be updated to reflect the correct icon.</span>

You also need to understand you absolutely will not be gaming without being plugged into the charger you will just gimp the component's if you don't play plugged into a outlet and have a bad time. Make sure you set up the PC to optimize performance and take full advantage of its dedicated nividia card and intel processor the ram can be upgraded but i would only put 16gigs in max the 8 gig stick is okay. The native 144hz screen is impressive for the price this laptop costs all in all if you know what your doing and know how games will run on the hardware that you want to play you will be happy with the buy.

<span>Bought this on a deal.  It has been a nice entry level gaming laptop for my husband.  I like that this can be upgraded with the extra RAM slot and an extra SSD slot and 2.5 bay.  Something to keep in mind, this does not accept anything made by crucial. I don’t know why, but I had a crucial nvme m2 internal ssd (4x4 gaming ssd) and a crucial 2.5 ssd and both caused the laptop to stay on a black screen upon boot up.  After a lot of research, there were many forums from others saying they also ran into this problem and crucial storage is not compatible with the bios.  Would I have bought this at full price at around $1000.  No.  For the deal I got it at, yes.  If you can get this during a deal and looking for a great starter gaming laptop, this is a good choice to go with.</span>

<span>I've only had this for a day now, so I can't speak to longevity. All in all I'm pleased with this laptop. It's lightweight but packs a punch still. Set up and updating was quick and easy. It's a great utilization of space, only a slim border around the screen and keyboard.<br/><br/>A few first impression negatives: you can see in other review images that it comes with 5 semi permanent stickers, (Nvidia, Intel, Alexa, 144hz, and a long feature banner). That was a bummer because they weren't in the product image, and they look awful (not to mention some were crooked). Thankfully they're removable, though I had to use glass cleaner to get rid of residue from one. Not a big deal though. The frame is very lightweight and flexible. The feet keep it raised which is good for cooling, but any pressure on the middle makes it flex, which I don't love. It's not going to crumble, but it's definitely a step down from my Lenovo with a metal body. You're paying for the internal components, not the frame.</span>

<span class="cr-original-review-content">Ya llevo con esta laptop casi un año y estas son mis impresiones:<br/><br/>1. Lo que más me gustó es la capacidad de expansión: ahora tiene 32 GB de RAM (crucial 3200MHz), dos discos NVMe (256GB, y 1 TB) y uno SATA de 1 TB.<br/>2. El rendimiento para los juegos es aceptable: Halo Infinite corre a unos 90 FPS a 1080p y calidad media-baja de configuración. Otros juegos menos exigentes corren por encima de los 100 FPS.<br/>3. Hablando de la pantalla, la tasa de refresco es alta, no es tan cómoda frente a la luz directa (el brillo no es muy alto) y la representación de colores no es la mejor. No lo recomendaría para edición de video o fotografía, a menos que se contara con un monitor secundario de alta calidad.<br/>4. Para desarrollo de software es un gran equipo, el procesador, aunque ya de dos generaciones atrás, responde bien. Windows inicia inmediatamente y funciona bien para virtualización.<br/>5. La batería dura máximo 3 horas y media.<br/>6. El puerto USB C no tiene capacidades de carga de la laptop o de salida de video. Sería ideal que un tuviera un lector de tarjetas integrado.<br/>7. No tiene el switch MUX (tampoco es de esperar en el rango de precios).<br/>8. El teclado se siente bien, el touchpad después del primer mes empezó a mostrar un brillo como si tuviera años de uso, sin embargo, mantiene su funcionamiento normal.<br/>9. No es un computador muy vistoso y la calidad de los plásticos no es la mejor. Más pesado que un equipo no orientado a juegos pero sigue siendo transportable.<br/>10. La cámara y el micrófono son aceptables para videollamadas. Creo que los streamers preferirán conectar mejores dispositivos.<br/><br/>Conclusión: revisar el precio y comparar. Si hay equipos con i5 o i7 de 12° generación o con RTX 3060, a un precio similar, sería mejor ir por esas opciones. Si el presupuesto es muy ajustado o está unos 200 dólares por debajo de la competencia, el Nitro 5 vale la pena.</span><span class="cr-translated-review-content aok-hidden"></span>

The features  are very convenient; i can see my phone notifications, transfer calls from my phone to my laptop, and drag tabs to my phone with myasus and xglide. it has three modes: silent, performance, and turbo which I find very useful for different task. However, I gave it a 4 star because the battery life isn't as long as they describe and also one of the keyboard's keys fell out and I had to reattach but it was minor problem so not that serious. I’m also writing this to disclose about my 90 day extended warranty.</span>

<span>For clarity, this review is for the 15.6" GTX 1650 version, not the 17.3" GTX 1650Ti version.<br/><br/>Positives!<br/><br/>This laptop is perfect for me and what I need right now. I am currently in between homes, over the road a lot for work and have all of my stuff in storage, including my main PC, so I bought a laptop so I could continue doing work and gaming while on the go.<br/>This laptop is not top of the line by any means, it's no $2,000 laptop with an RTX 3080 or anything like that, but if you want a good mid-range laptop that can get 60FPS on some everyday gaming, this is as good as mid-range laptops get in my opinion.<br/>Even on my main, much beefier PC, I've never been one to crank up the settings and enable raytracing, 4k etc. I'm more of a framerate type of person and this laptop does a great job getting high frame rates if you're willing to adjust the settings accordingly. The screen is a clean 1920x1080, lovely quality (though the brightness isn't that great), comes with an NVME 512GB hard drive which is not a bad start if you're not trying to install a Call of Duty game with 100gb patches, but that leads into another glowing positive - this thing is upgradeable and I love it! One of the hardest things about picking a laptop for me is the eventual obsolescence, so in the few times I've bought a laptop in my life, I prefer ones you can upgrade which will allow you to skirt by the expected lifespan for a bit longer.<br/>Overall, my complaints a few, but I will point them out.<br/><br/>Negatives!<br/>Honestly, 8GB of RAM is... well, it's not enough for any modern PC that you want to do more than browse the internet, but this negative hardly counts against it because once again, it is upgradeable! I added 32GB to mine and it runs like a dream now. The fact it ships with such low RAM is forgivable because that's probably why the price of entry is as low as it is.<br/>I also had a few problems with the Wi-Fi antenna at first, which I know is not unique to my laptop, but after a few online searches, troubleshooting and settings adjustments, it hasn't dropped the connection for a couple of days, so I think I'm over that hump.<br/>My last complaint and honestly maybe the only one that could be considered "major" is the screen brightness. To be clear, I'm talking about BRIGHTNESS, not QUALITY. The resolution is wonderful and the screen is a clear HD experience, but keep this thing away from the sunlight if you want to see it easily... I took it to the park one day and while I could see the screen, I felt like I was squinting, and I had to change my preferred dark mode to light mode just to see the Windows UI better. Once again, I consider this a minor gripe and won't take a star off, because if you're using this thing indoors or in appropriate shade, the screen is beautiful.<br/><br/>Overall, if you're looking for an affordable, upgradeable, laptop suited for everyday gaming (as long as you're not trying to push max settings, 4k or raytracing), you won't be disappointed!</span>

<span>My hubby is the big PC gamer, I am a consol peasant. However, there are certain games we have been itching to play together and they are either not cross platform within game or just PC only. When we saw this deal I thought "well my old laptop is laggy AF and has no memory and was never meant for gaming" so we decided to get this in place of a full blown PC set up (which we didn't have space for even if I wanted it).<br/>But I am impressed, for a medium serious gamer, the battery life is decent, i play over wifi and it's still great without ethernet cable. They designed really well so it doesn't overheat and does not require external cooling fans, as the air blows out the back, I would suggest giving it a few inches from the wall which most people do anyway because the air blowing out can be pretty warm.<br/>The laptop is quiet but the fans do make some background noise but it's not bothersome, and I hardly notice it when playing a game only when shutting it down.<br/>Overall I'm very happy with it! I would recommend this brand if anyone asked me.</span>

<span>So we just got this laptop a couple days ago, and I'll update things as they go along. Firstly it's a pretty decent laptop for the money, trying to read reviews on it is a pretty mixed basket because they have so many other cheap/er laptops that most of the reviews are not for this one. So you'll have to pay attention to the model number they are reviewing. (Acer Aspire 5 A515-56-702V)<br/>Here's a couple of my deciding points which lead to the purchase:<br/><br/>- Aluminum case (not super thick but still not plastic) has a more sturdy feel to it (within reason as this is not a $2K laptop).<br/><br/>- Solid Intel i7 Processor, first came to market Sep 2020. Good sized cache.<br/><br/>- It has a 512GB NVMe SSD drive in it which is the M.2 format, these are some of the fastest drives out right now as far as standards go. Most laptops with SSD are taking about the SATA drives, which while fast, are not anywhere close to the M.2 speeds.<br/><br/>- Being that it's an M.2 drive this leaves an entire drive bay empty in the laptop for future storage upgrade (SATA) if needed or having an alternate backup drive right in the laptop etc. (i.e. expandable in the future if you need it)<br/><br/>- It has 16GB of memory, I'm not sure why so many laptops out there only have 8GB, just running basic windows will eat at least 5GB+ of memory which doesn't leave a lot left for everything else. (In my humble opinion) and I appreciated the ability to upgrade that further in the future if needed to 24GB.<br/><br/>- It has plenty of USB ports and HDMI out for conference rooms/TV's etc.<br/><br/>Some of the cons:<br/>- The power adapter is a very small "pin" power adapter. Needless to say this was rather disappointing because we all know that sometimes cords get pulled or bumped etc. And it's likely to damage the internals because it's very small. I would have liked to see one of the thicker power adapter connections just for strength.<br/>- Windows 11 - Personally I'm not a huge fan thus far but mainly just for functionality reasons like you can't ungroup open programs on the task bar, it's one icon and that's it with no ability to change it. It's not a tablet it's a computer.<br/>- No Thunderbolt Port<br/>- No option to charge via USB C (which would negate the very tiny pin adapter)<br/><br/>So we did run into a couple issues. We had a problem with the laptop not seeing the power cord plugged in, it would blink as if it was going to start working (windows battery page in settings) then act like it was never plugged in. We reached out to Acer and they had us reset the battery via a paperclip and pin hole on the bottom. It's worked find so far after that. Getting a tech on the online chat via Acer support was fast and he was able to quickly resolve the issue.<br/><br/>So generally, this being my very first Acer Laptop, I'm pleased with things so far. We'll see how it holds up in the long run.</span>

<span>After a couple months of use by my teenagers, the laptop seems to be holding up very well. It is responsive enough with Windows 11 for basic schoolwork or web browsing. Like the screen size and resolution. I initially had a concern that the laptop was not charging properly, but using the battery controller reset on the bottom seems to have solved the problem, it has been working well for several months now.</span>

<span>I bought this laptop just to have something "mobile" when I want to get online or do some "light work" out of the house (I normally use my desktop computer which is a BEAST!)<br/><br/>I will be using this to watch movies/videos, surf the net, check emails, go on social media and a couple other programs such a OBDII reader that I will use with my OBDII device via wifi or usb to work on my cars.<br/><br/>4GB of ram is good enough for what I will be doing. If I ever feel that it needs a little more power/speed I will add another 4 or 8 but so far it is perfect.<br/><br/>The 128GB SSD is more than enough for what I need and this was one of the key factors that made me buy this computer. Cheaper ones come with eMMC storage which is slower and normally only 32GB or 64GB<br/><br/>It does not have backlit keyboard, I wish it did but it is not a deal breaker and I already knew it didn't have it before placing my order.<br/><br/>It takes about 45 seconds to boot (a little bit on the slow side) but once its loaded it runs pretty smoothly<br/><br/>It came with Windows 11 S More which won't allow you to install anything except from the Microsoft store (I think that's what's called), but getting out of S mode is SUPER EASY, takes less than 1 minute. There are plenty of YouTube videos on how to do that. But, be aware, seems like if you get out of S mode there is no turning back!<br/><br/>In a few words, this is a very good machine for the price. I am not intending to use it for gaming, editing videos or designing. It is strictly for light use (browse the net, documents, watching videos/movies, and a couple of programs that I like that don't require much to run).<br/><br/>It is pretty lightweight, the casing looks nice, the screen is matte and bright enough, the speakers are OK, seems a little bit fragile if you were to drop it or step on it (I am always careful, so this is not a concern). I also like the fact that is a name brand and is not a chrome book!<br/><br/>I don't give it 5 stars because it would've been nice to get it with 8GB and a backlit keyboard. Other than that is perfect for what I need!</span>

<span>Ive inly been really using this laptop for like a month and a half but Its a good laptop. For rreference though My last laptop I had was used when I recieved it and "on its last legs" and started having noticible issues once it turned 11 years old...I enjoy doing video editing and that over a decade old laptop was no longer covering it so I decided to inest in this laptop. With its core I7 processer of 16gb of ram its doing really well amd seems to not struggle at all for what I do and or need. Its a good computer cabale of doing lots of work and the battery life is superb. I ran a couple of stress tests on it and it preformed well. The one downside is that because its windows 11 alot of stuff that was free and or included on windows 10 or lower is not included , most of the software thats available on this laptop is consistent of free trials or trying to get you to make a yearly purchase to use the programs such as the microsoft suite ( which will run 99$ a year or the price of like 9.99 a month). And the free trials are short lived or require you to put in credit card info...so I would suggest anyone who gets this laptop to be ready to either pay for what use to be free or start doing research on free open source software that is comparable to whatever programs you may want to use that are no longer free on the windows platform. Windows 11 isnt really bad its just different. As for the hardware I suggest doing your research before buying this laptop, and make sure you get the correct processer type for what you do, core I3 or below will not cut it in most cases try core i5 or higher and get atleast 16gb of ram aka memory to be on the safe side for anything other then really light light computer use. Also since this is a thinner laptop it has no cd rom and can in some cases overheat a little as it needs some ventalation when in use if doing heavy duty work which is to be expected for its thinness, and my very slight complaint is that while doing heavy duty work it can get to humming a bit too loudly for my taste but nothing that is too terribly concerning. I reccomend this laptop and I love it thus far.</span>

<span>You might think that only 4 gb for a Windows 10 laptop that cant expand the ram is a bad idea... Well, I've found this small laptop is actually fine, even quick for internet browsing, email, word processing and watching videos.  Sure, the keyboard is smaller, but even with large hands, I had no trouble typing...<br/><br/> Obviously, this is not a good choice for gaming or video editing work.  Battery life is very good for the intended basic uses; not Apple Ipad good;  but should give you at least 6+ hours for the basics...<br/><br/> It DOES have a micro SD slot, in addition to the 2 USB ports.<br/><br/>While you can't expand the RAM, you can also expand the storage with an internal NVME stick.<br/><br/>This is a great idea as it noticeably speeds up the computer if you make it the boot drive.  I added a 500GB Samsung 980 NVME stick and am very pleased with the results.<br/><br/>Having read about issues with the Samsung Magician cloning software, and difficulties in making a boot drive change work well on this laptop; let me tell you what worked well for me...<br/><br/>Ordered the Samsung nvme stick, along with a $15 external USB enclosure for this type of chewing gum stick size drive. Downloaded the free version of Easeus Partition Master software to clone the built in Asus L210 drive. Loaded the new stick in the external drive enclosure, connected the drive with a USB cable to a USB slot on the Asus, and followed the directions to clone the Asus C drive.  Opened the Asus and inserted the Samsung stick into the open nvme slot. Pressed power button holding down F2 key to get into bios.<br/><br/>Change the boot order to start with the nvme stick. Save and exit. Booting then detected issues with Windows, so choose to download and install a new, clean copy of Windows 10.  ( If you do this right after you have received the Asus, then you don't have any reason to save data or settings on this Windows clean install.  You don't yet have any personal data to save.)  When Windows is finished with the reinstall, make sure to do your windows updates.<br/><br/>After that is done, use Disk management tool to reformat the original drive,  and resize the partitions on the new nvme drive to what is available.<br/><br/>Now your little, inexpensive laptop is faster, with plenty of drive space.  Certainly one of the better values you can get in a very portable size, great for traveling when you may not want to carry a larger, more expensive laptop.  Screen quality is very good, and the Asus has a full size hdmi out for easy video sharing.  Definitely recommended for the price point and its intended use.</span>

<span>I've recently taken up 3D printing and saving files to an SD card on my 8 yr old laptop with a broken screen was a pain. I like this lil laptop. It's been pretty easy to use. I did take it back to the windows 10 because thats what I'm used to using and so much easier to use and navigate. I use this Asus laptop for my 3D model searching, slicing 3D model's in several apps, I was able to connect it to 1 of my 3D printers and successfully printed model's, I've used it for my Cricut machine with design space. I've used it to watch Amazon prime, Netflix, and YouTube videos (I do have to connect a Bluetooth speaker). I've done file transfers from my phone to the laptop. I would not say this is a gaming laptop, but my son did try it out for a couple of games and liked it. It does not have a touch screen, which is a disappointment. It charges fairly quickly and holds a charge for a long time. 1 issue with the built in number pad in the mouse pad, it keeps turning on and then can't get it to turn off for a while. It's pretty touchy. It is very lightweight and portable. Something a college student could fit into a backpack.</span>

I have always been a mother who wanted to teach my son truth and skills so public schools just aren't our thing. Well I'm learning it may be my son's but thank Jesus that we are so far along that a laptop can give him all the aspects of education and tools to navigate his desires within the educational system. This computer is his new best friend and I'm pretty stoked as well. Came with windows 11. Very nice shape</span>

<span>This laptop came in excellent condition.  Initially, I had some concerns about buying a renewed computer but was pleasant surprised when it arrived.  It has everything I was looking for in a laptop.  I would not hesitate to recommend buying one from Amazon to family and friends.</span>
