<span>It’s a very economical and accurate thermal imager, though i was surprised that it doesn’t seem to capture hot gasses like an exhaust leak or a fart. The battery life could be a bit better but it does the job. I can easily locate studs and rafters due to the higher conductivity</span>

<blockquote><em><div class="a-row a-spacing-small review-data"><span class="a-size-base review-text review-text-content" data-hook="review-body">
<span>This thing blows my mind.  At first, I had sticker shock and told myself, “Well, just try it out.”  I bought it to figure out if I had frozen pipes in my house during the winter and told myself I’d return it after.  That was four months ago - I still have it because I fell in love.<br/><br/>Good news is that the Flir showed me that my pipes were perfectly fine (and warm!) but that my dishwasher’s filter that was clogged.  This is a new house and I wouldn’t have known to check.  That right there saved me a plumber’s inspection and bill!<br/><br/>It’s so fun to use that I kept looking at other stuff around the house.  I found a whole bunch of spots in the walls where cold air was coming through around light switches and wall outlets.  Also discovered problems in my attic.  I’m also able to check for water leaks by running hot water and see where that water really goes on the camera!  Figured out the door to the garage was in desperate need of weatherstripping - the house stays much warmer now and that right there dropped my heating bill by $50 a month.<br/><br/>This camera has already paid for itself and I haven’t even used it for a really tough job - verify an insulation installer did their job!  I’ll be hiring one soon and I’m actually looking forward to it instead of dreading it.<br/><br/>I’ve had this Flir since December and so far the battery is a champ and I love how easy it is to recharge.  The controls are pretty easy to figure out (fun to play with!) and I like how the temperature readings display precision to 0.1 degrees.  11/10 would buy again.</span>

<span>Don't have much to compare it to as I'm a new user to thermal cameras. It was easy to set up and start using. I found it a little disorienting for it to constantly change the relative ranges. I'd think it would be better to fix it to something like room temp as the mid point. But I'm no expert. Maybe this is normal for these.</span>

<span>This product works well. I was able to locate air leaks in my house, and areas that need insulation that was missing completely. I used this as a consumer to weatherize my home myself. Saved me $500 vs hiring someone with a infrared camera to do the same thing I did with it.<br/><br/>I also use it to troubleshoot my pcb electronic designs I build as a hobby. That works well, but the resolution is not quite high enough for very small parts less than 5 mm.<br/><br/>Overall, I recommend this product. Just make sure it meets your use case needs.</span>

<span>You wouldn't use this to see heat at much distance. It is perfect for visualizing heat within the space of a room. Resolution is fair, not spectacular. I like that it shows the high and low temperature spots. Reaction time is reasonable, though expect that it will have a recalibration pause every so often that freezes the screen for a few seconds.

<span>Got this FLIR camera to help with home projects. Have air leaks and wanted to find them to do some home projects. The FLIR ONE Gen 3 - Android (USB-C) is not commercial grade but works well. I was able to identify hot and cold pipes through drywall. It also was able to see where drywall was much colder than the rest of the room to identify air leaks behind the wall. Works on windows and fireplace as well.  FLIR ONE is a good name brand and the product quality is good. It plugs into the USB-C port of your cell phone or tablet and you download the software from your device's app store. It also charges with USB-C port and charge lasts months during non-use and multiple hours of use.<br/><br/>It is worth noting the focal distance is not very far. It is for indoor use or close proximity use. Perhaps 15 feet distance to check drywall/windows/doors to determine if cool/hot spots exist and less than 5 feet for detailed pictures to find pipes behind walls or specific air leaks. It is not for night driving, hunting, sporting, etc.<br/><br/>It is both a tool and play thing (if you are a bit of a tech geek) that will get used more than you may originally think.</span>

<span>I’m happy with this infrared camera and it will help me to make home improvements with insulation weak spots for winter and summer.  It is also useful for finding hot devices quickly, and “seeing” duct work and water leaks through drywall and ceiling. With the instant temperature readout in the image, the camera is also useful for taking a person’s forehead temperature, or spotting someone in a crowd that might be hotter than everyone else. The battery doesn’t seem to last long for extended use or multiple projects through a day, but it does last long enough to finish a project.  To properly overlay and align a visible light image onto the infrared image, the camera requires adjustment based on distance from the subject which is a pain to try to keep up with during a project unless you maintain the same distance. Sometimes my phone seems to lose the connection to the camera and I need to pull it off and restart to continue.  Other than these concerns, the device is very useful and will help to survey and improve home heating and cooling, my main purpose.</span>

<span>It’s better to use for exterior work. Standing inside a small home I kept finding myself trying to back up or wishing I could zoom out to get the full view of the room. Constantly feel too close to the area that is displayed on the image.<br/><br/> Battery life is kinda crappy but probably to be expected.<br/><br/>Still unclear if it starts as soon as you plug it in or if you have to turn it on then plug it in, or start the app first then…… well whatever.</span>

<span>Although the resolution of thermal imaging is low, the addition of live image overlays gives a great idea of the target. When looking at the temperature of things, its the average over an area that matter anyway. Already saw unexpected heat loss around the house. The image automatically scale from blue (coldest) to white (hottest) in the image. So you do have to take that into consideration. For example on image might be 50F to 100F and another might be 65 to 70 but the auto scaling makes 70F in one image look as hot as 100F in another. Use the on screen cursor to see the true temperature to the nearest 1/10 of a degree!</span>

<span>Works exactly as described. Only things to improve are that the initial startup time is between 10-20s, which the app is warning about. I assume that is due to some system component having to warm, so probably not fixable at this price point. Other thing is I am worried that the device has it's own battery instead of drawing power from the phone. I can already foresee that that will be the reason for it's obsolescence in a year, because it will have been stored at the wrong battery state for too long.</span>

<span>I'll keep this short and sweet:<br/>1.  Unlike what is mentioned in the description, this device ABSOLUTELY DOES NOT MEASURE BODY TEMPERATE AND CAN'T BE USED FOR SUCH.  THAT IS A BLATANT LIE.  You can adjust emissitivity but there is no setting for the temperature range mentioned.  You 'can' measure body temp but it will not be accurate nor consistent.<br/>2.  This is a good (and fun) camera.  I've been "ghost hunting" all over the house with the grandkids.  With some planning, you can leave heat signatures behind and then "find" them later, spooking everyone.  I seem to have odd hand prints on the wall and people sitting in chairs when nobody is there.  Oooooo, scary.<br/>3.  It can detect animals in the dark.  From about 30' I picked up a rabbit in my back yard.  The best night setting seems to be arctic or black hot for this.<br/>4.  It has good detail and lets you see what your looking at from a reasonable distance.  Of course there is no zoom so this will work well for looking at a breaker box but the little rabbit I mentioned earlier was just a little dot.  In my breaker box I could see how much energy my two water heaters were drawing.  Yikes!<br/>5.  Being able to blue tooth the picture to the phone is great.  You can use the software to prepare a report and send to a customer (or whomever) or take a pic of your overheating AC system and send it to your HVAC guy.  Wonderful.<br/>6.  You can check for air leaks, cold and hot spots and window efficiency.  You can see water lines though walls, check coils on freezers and refrigerators, check for blockages on car radiators or condensers and so on.  You can even see the inefficiency of your doors.  It's like having X-ray vision!<br/><br/>Cons:<br/>I don't have that many but one seems to stand out.  It is laggy.  The picture produced is a real-time picture with a thermal overlay and these can misalign easily.  Sometimes when moving the device, the picture will move but the thermal will lag and you have to wait for it to catch up.  It also washes out easily.  If you're checking the house and come across a light source, which will be amplified through the thermal cam, it will wash out and you have to wait for it to reset.<br/>I have both the 165 and the 267 and the 267 is the better purchase, even valuable for the casual user like myself.</span>

<span>(EDITED 27 MAY 21)<br/>IF you have a Otterbox cover on your phone-- please be sure you order a small  extender for it. (If you do so- make sure you select the correct connection ends; E.G., "C", "Mini A" or "Micro B") The Otterbox is made in a way that you'll have to dismantle the lower 1/2 of the cover to have it fit correctly.<br/><br/>The following may help any issues with the product becoming loose or falling totally out of the phone; As I stated before the Otterbox cover on my S20+ required me to use an extension. It does help, but it can possibly be unstable. Since we use this thermal camera during our team paranormal investigations, ithe unit falling out can be a real ordeal in a well lighted area, let alone in a dark confined abandoned venue.<br/><br/>First, I'll state the obvious even if you don't use a Otterbox- make sure the thumb turn wheel is in it's correct position and 'finger' tightened- no pliers! You will bust it! I've heard of some individuals using a homemade rubber band combination to hold it firmly. I guess this may work or help some, but I wanted a safer solution to protect my investment.<br/><br/>What I did was simply construct a handheld holding device for it. I think it would be against community standards to give specifics, and I in no way wish to violate any policies. I'll just stick to a basic idea. I used parts I had around from two old phone holders, a simple grip handle, a flat mounting board, a hot glue gun and a 6 inch male "C" to male "C" O.TG. cable. I made it just to hold everything securely together is all. If you wish to use your imagination and attempt this, please note: YOU MUST USE A O.T.G. TYPE CABLE! (On The Go) Otherwise, it WILL NOT work! O.T.G cables are different than regular USB cables. They're usually shorter than USB cables too.. They are sold on Amazon where I got mine. I'd recommend Amazon due to the many choices available and they have best prices for them.<br/><br/>Also, just sayin'— I DO NOT SELL PRIVATELY, CONTRUCT FOR PUBLIC SALE, NOR ENDORSE ANY PERSON(S) OR COMPANIES WHO MAKE A DEVICE AS SUCH. I just made one for some old guy— ME! LOL!<br/><br/>Thanks! I hoped maybe this helped someone.<br/><br/>J. "Doc" Lykins, PNI, EMT-Paramedic (Ret.)

<span>Me:  homeowner and DIY'er.  I use this product to scan my walls, doors, and windows for thermal data.  I use this data to inform my decisions about weatherproofing and risk.  I have used this product to identify areas where I need to improve weatherstripping and insulation.  I am satisfied with its performance because I can see a difference in the photos after I apply corrective measures to the affected area.  Other reviewers have noted the short battery life of the device.  They are correct, the battery does not last very long. That said, I have never yet been unable to finish a task due to battery failure.  I usually use this for a few minutes at a time and the battery is fine.  The resolution of the photos is average at best.  This is fine by me because if I don't need high-resolution IR photos.  If I want high res regular photos, I'll use my cell phone or another camera. One piece of advice: Get yourself a rubber band to hold the FLIR onto your cell phone, otherwise it will fall off every few minutes.  The USB-C connector is not sufficient to hold the FLIR onto your camera as you move around.<br/><br/>SUGGESTION TO THE MANUFACTURER:  Nice device, but it would be very helpful if you added a function that would automatically take two photos when the button is pressed: One photo in the visible spectrum (regular photo), and one IR photo showing temperature differential.  Because the IR photos can be low res, I find it very helpful to first take a regular photo for orientation purposes, and then re-take the shot in IR mode.  Manually switching between the two modes is annoying.  Please make a function that takes both at the same time.  Thanks.</span>

<span>The LT model has the lower resolution like the FLIR ONE but has the software of the FLIR ONE Pro. More software options makes the lower resolution less of an issue by outlining the images using information from the visible light lens. In practice around the house you just need to get closer to the surface to see detail after scanning more broadly from a distance not unlike a conventional camera really. Battery life is limited so when your done playing (it is fun) recharge it and plan on getting getting your survey done in under an hour. A few tips.<br/>1] Glass is opaque to IR so don't pay any attention to the reading you get from it.<br/>2] Shiny things emit IR poorly and reflect it like a mirror. Don't be fooled by your own reflection.<br/>3] Put a piece of electrical tape on a shiny surface and read the temperature of the tape.<br/>4] Water holds heat surprisingly well so to find dampness try a fan or A/C temperature changes to create a temperature difference and moisture will stand out. Confirm your suspicions with a moisture meter.<br/>5] Sun and wind outdoors can change the surface temperature and confuse matters. Its not hard to imagine the liquid propane in the bottom of the tank being cooler that the vapor in the top, or for that matter the same temperature for a period of time.<br/>6] The default colors indicate the highest and lowest temperature in view not hot and cold per se. My nephew isn't the Human Torch in Antarctica but if he was the image would be a range of purple to yellow as well.<br/>7] It can seem like you can see through things but you can't. You only see surface temperature differences. In the middle picture you can see a missing insulation bat in the ceiling and three windows. If you look closely you can see my reflection in the right hand window. Also if I had put my hand on one of the windows a hand print would be immediately visible and persist for several minutes.<br/>8] When observing a power panel do it while the connected devices are on and drawing current. Unloaded power panels are no fun in IR. Put a measuring spot on the point in question and make sure its really "too" hot and not just warmer that surrounding areas. Breakers and wires under load will be warmer normally and stand out. If it's a loose connection issue the entire wire will not "glow" in the image; just the end connected to the breaker.<br/>9] You may be able to see breaker bus bar connection issues by heat that seems to emanate from the gap between the breakers and not the breaker itself. Remember, bus bars are shiny and mirror like so the heat u see may be your own body heat reflected back at you. Stand off to the side or kill the mains and try the tape trick.</span>

<span>Ever buy one of those crappy little $20 drones that you have to charge forever only to be able to use it for like 7 minutes?  Well the battery on this thing appears to be similarly lame.  First off the directions for this thing absolutely suck and may as well not even exist.  They tell you to charge the thing for an hour before using it which seems to imply that it will be fully charged at that point, right?  Guess again!  I'm still not sure exactly how long it takes to fully charge yet.  Another thing is that they don't really tell you what any of the lights on this thing actually indicate.  Sometimes they're orange, sometimes they're green.  Sometimes they flash in seemingly random rapid bursts (which usually can't mean anything good is happening) and sometimes they're solid.  They don't even tell you how you can tell it is fully charged.  I'm assuming that happens when the green charging LED finally turns off but I don't no for sure because they didn't bother to mention it in the instructions!!  Even those crappy little $20 drones tell you that much, albeit in broken English.<br/><br/>Other than that it wouldn't be fair if I didn't mention that this thing has pretty good image quality and seems to work well but I'll probably end up returning it because of my lack of confidence in the battery life and charging method especially after reading all the negative reviews related to how these things fail which is usually battery related.  $400 may be relatively cheap for this type of product but that doesn't make it sting any less if it only ends up working for a few weeks or months.<br/><br/>UPDATE: So, in fairness, it looks like the first device I got may have had a defective battery or something like that.  I sent it back to Amazon for replacement and the new one provides more realistic reporting of the remaining battery life and actually charges to 100%.  Thank you Amazon!!!

<span>The first unit I got would not accept a charge.  Just a steady red light when plugged into charger.  A call to FLIR support and attempting to reset it (that failed) confirmed that it would have to be returned.<br/><br/>Amazon provided a replacement the next day.  The second unit functioned but the IR and visible image would not converge even with the camera alignment slider adjustment.  It was the weekend (FLIR support is M-F only) so I had to  tough it out with an amazon trouble shooter for an hour before they agreed that it was defective.  The third unit functions fairly well.  Convergence is now very close but not 100% (ignoring the keystoning) but I have to use it on a trip so I will live with it and possible sort it out later (within the prime return period). I really wish the alignment slider would have a wider range of adjustment or they would better align the camera or better pack it  if in fact it was working perfectly when manufactured.  I can only assume that one of the 2 cameras in the FLIR ONE PRO is getting knocked out of alignment because it was dropped in shipping. they are very poorly packed with a very small amazon shipping  box and airpacks cushioning  only 2 of the 6 faces of the FLIR box. Yep it pressed in to the corner of the packing box.  So easy to see that it may have been  knocked pretty hard if it got dropped in shipping.<br/><br/>***  2 years after purchase now( purchased April 2022) I have decided  to update the review.  I used the unit initially to make sure I sat with the coolest people on aircraft in early days of COVID.  That worked very well.  I have also used it professionally to look for hot spots in Electronic equipment under development and at home looking for insulation voids in, walls  attic and  insulated ducting in attic,  also to locate hot  water leak in concrete floor pad.  But I did not use it that often.  Once or twice a month.  Left it charged at 50 to 75% most of the time.  The problem is almost a year after purchase,  the battery seemed not to hold a charge as well.  But by the time I confirmed it,  I was 2 months past the 1 year warranty.  Now at the end of 2 years, it will not hold a charge for a week.  I have to give it ~ 90 minute  charge before every use and it only works for maybe 10 or 15 minutes and it is dead.  Will hunt to see if I can get a high quality replacement battery from reputable OEM and if there is a youtube video on how to replace it,  Great tool.  Pretty good brand.  Too bad they did not spend an extra $2 on a good quality OEM battery for a $400 tool.</span>

<span>It's great for anything you need a thermal camera for. The pic shows the difference in temp between my UV/Heat Blocking privacy tint on the same window. Top is untinted, bottom is with the tint. There are tons of uses. Having a total of 3 custom measurement points as well as a "hottest" and "coldest" point, for up to 5 points, is really handy.<br/><br/>The second pic is inside a closet, looking at the ceiling. If you want to know where your insulation is lacking, you will with this. I also use it for powder coating.  It's got too many uses to list here. If you need one, it's a great item. Just make sure you get the correct model for your temp range. The cheaper one doesn't go high enough for powder coating but it would be great for a home inspector.</span>

<span>The MSX Image Enhancement Technology generates an outline of the objects in the picture to help identify what it is you are looking at (example pic attached).<br/><br/>Funny Story, I looked at the yard at night and saw a small hot spot in the yard and figured it was a mouse or small rat or something, so I was going to scare it away before the dogs got to it.  I went out into the yard and before I could stop the dogs, they were with me.  As I got closer to the hot spot, the dogs went ahead and got near the hot spot like they knew it was there but didn't go after whatever it was.  When I finally got there, I saw it was a fressh dog poop (no pic attached :).</span>

<span>This is worth the buy if you can find practical uses for it.  For example, finding studs, checking the relative effectiveness of air barriers and seals throughout the house, water leaks, electrical wire heat, appliance heat.<br/><br/>Background and Perspective:<br/>This device brings a very unique and useful tool into the hands of those who couldn’t normally afford the higher end version. The more expensive version of this tool for the public is about $25,000 dollars.  Therefore it’s limited to those who use it for professional use.  Yet this version can be used for the home or low quality commercial diagnoses.  This version cannot compare fairly to the more expensive version so to criticize it doesn’t allow fairness to the fact that it still provides very useful and helpful information to those who can make use of the information you can gain from it.<br/><br/>The ‘SEEK’ Ability:<br/>There are important aspects of this device that you must understand before you buy so you know what to expect in terms of range and visibility.  This device will not be a disappointment as long as you know what to expect.  The device doesn’t have the outline overlay feature of it’s only competitor but that’s not as important since most of the time you will be looking for significant temperature variations that when captured in the view, will automatically allow you to distinguish what is hot/cold because it will stick out from other objects in the view.  If the view on the camera is not easy to understand, just look past the phone and get oriented.  It’s not a big deal, use your other eye<br/><br/>I measured the amount of area I could view with the camera and the length at which I had to stand in order to capture an object.  (see pictures)  These are the distances from the objects in my pictures to the lense of the camera.  See pictures for quality.<br/>1)  You can see my finger when it is 4-inches from the lense<br/>2)  The center of my watch is 10.25-inches from the lense<br/>3)  The 3’ x 5.5’ window is 12.85’ from the lense<br/>4)  The Printer and 2 Power Adaptors are 5’ from lense  (there are two adaptors in the picture and they are not distinguishable from each other)<br/><br/>Description of other pictures:<br/>5)  There was a hot water leak as you can see from the hotter area in the waste pipe in the ceiling – I was able to see it unexpectedly and found the upstairs faucet to be left open.<br/>6)  I was able to see the area of hot air normally invisible, from a low flame on the stove<br/>7)  I was able to see a difference in temperatures from two windows where apartments where renovated and that of two windows where apartments where not renovated.<br/>8)  I can see the heat from my computer and hard-drive<br/>9)  I could see the cold water and hot water pipe in blue and yellow respectively<br/>10)  I could see the temperature of the boiler gas fan<br/><br/>Toilet-Paper Roll as the Frame of View:<br/>In order to imagine the field of view you should expect; a good perspective for you to understand what scanning your environment would look like is to take a used toilet-paper roll and raise it to one eye.  The area you can view through the toilet roll is pretty much the same area you catch from the lense of the camera while holding the camera at 9-12 inches from your nose.  The default magnification of the SEEK is large.  If you slightly squeeze the toilet roll, forming a vertical elliptical, it would mimic the field of view you would get from holding the phone in portrait view; and the same if you did the same horizontally for a landscape view.<br/><br/>Lag:<br/>There is a lag of 1-second when the ‘image soothing’ feature is off and a 2-second lag with the feature ‘on’.  I don’t yet see any use for the smoothing feature.  I don’t think it makes a difference.  When scanning across the screen of the Plasma TV, the image is best when scanning at about two seconds per foot across the screen when 8 feet away from the screen.<br/><br/>Battery:<br/>Since the SEEK uses your phone battery it can last a fair amount of time.  I happen to have en extended battery on my phone which is slightly old and I also use the SEEK periodically and randomly throughout the day as I am still playing around with what I can find with it.  I don’t find the need to look after my battery level at all.  I do not feel the seek is a battery drain.<br/><br/>Compatibility:<br/>I have a Samsung S4 with Android 5.0.1 and the camera and features listed work fine.  There is one feature I didn’t find talked about much and that is the ‘Image Smoothing’ feature, which works fine.<br/><br/>The volume buttons also function as camera shutter buttons.  Since the port is on the bottom I activate rotation on the phone and turn it upside down.  This is useful except when you want to use dual image mode whereby your hand ends up blocking the phone camera as you hold the phone normally.  I find it useful to use dual camera mode when turning the camera in landscape view while taking pictures<br/><br/>Color Palette:<br/>The colors are varied.  There are 9 color palette options.  The color adjusts to what the hottest and coldest temperatures in the view are.  If you have a face in the view and then light a match next to the person while in the view the color gradient will adjust to highlight the NEW hottest points to the coolest points.<br/><br/>Menu Options:<br/>Help<br/>----Tutorials<br/>----Reset Help Overlays<br/>----Report and Issue<br/>----Visit Support Center<br/>Temperature Units (select)<br/>----Fahrenheit<br/>----Celsius<br/>----Kelvin<br/>Image preferences<br/>----Aspect Ratio (select)<br/>--------16:9<br/>--------4:3<br/>----Watermarks<br/>--------Date and Time (on/off)<br/>--------Location (on/off)<br/>--------Seek Logo (on/off)<br/>----Metadata<br/>--------Disable Geo-tagging  (on/off)<br/>Image Smoothing (on/off)<br/>Terms and policies<br/>----Privacy Policy<br/>----Terms and Conditions<br/>Help Us Improve<br/>----Send Usage Data (on/off)<br/>About<br/>----Application Software Version<br/>----Image Processing Software Version<br/><br/>Phone Camera Dual Image:<br/>I find this feature not useful except for times when I want to take a picture to log the environment I was in at the time as I can imagine forgetting the context of a thermal picture and use the visible light picture to remind me what I am looking at a later time.<br/><br/>When using the dual image overlay which is best in landscape mode, the SEEK and phone camera are usually positioned poorly in three ways.  A) the thermal image and the phone camera image are at different zoom ratios  B)  the images do not line up next to each other in any useful way.  I would find it useful to take a dual image picture while the thermal image of an object is fully viewable in half the display and the visible phone camera picture is also of the object in full display BUT this is NOT the case  C) although you can zoom the phone camera in the dual overlay mode, doing so actually magnifies the thermal image as well, which make the feature even more useless.<br/>*If SEEK made the micro-usb with the ability to pivot slightly it would be extremely useful in order to line up pictures properly in dual image mode.<br/><br/>Manual Zoom:<br/>The picture of my finger is set at the closest zoom.  Even when scanning a building façade 250’ away, the best focus was at the middle of the range of focus available on the SEEK device.<br/><br/>I will add more info as I see fit in the future.</span>

<span>Do not buy this. This is an absolute garbage of a product. First, I believe this is at least seven years old, and I believe this was some type of a beta test product for the company to fund other products. Sad that they are still selling this now at its current price. Not worth more than $50, and that too for kids and ghost hunters. It was grainy, grainy, grainy. The resolution increase is simply not there.<br/><br/>I am leaving this review because this company wasted my time through false advertising. If you watch the company’s trailer for Seek Compact, it shows non-blurry, detailed photos. Not what I experienced with the seek compact I received. Perhaps they downgraded compact's quality to sell the pro version. Anyway, zero stars. Returning it on the same day as I received it.<br/><br/>--<br/><br/>Edit: 10/29/2022<br/><br/>I am revising my review to four stars. I compared this tool to Filr One Gen 3 and Seek Compact was indeed better. Four stars because my brand new phone wouldn't detect the device attached numerous times, which is either an app issue or a product issue.<br/><br/>The grainy picture is a result of lack of temperature variance viewed areas. Higher resolution will give you less grain as they will be able to pick up more temperature variance. With Filr One Gen 3, the pictures are simply smoothed out to avoid grain.</span>

<span>So this was a BD gift. Pro model for Android USB C.<br/><br/>I liked the idea of viewing things in IR. You will probably want to know my level of technical competence. Ok. I fixed numerous phones (by smd solder work), many cars (hardware and software), and countless computers (load, reload OS, software troubleshooting, board level repars, etc) and wrote few pieces of commercially used software. This is not to beef up my resume, but to give you a fair idea on how to estimate my review of this device. Did I know what I am doing or not. Up to you.<br/><br/>The Seek Thermal looks great and is packaged like an iPhone. There went probably $50 of your money. Comes with the device and the specially made storage box that looks like an underwater case. Wow. I can imagine how happy will I be, already. Under the device is hidden a useless amazing quality print brochure.<br/><br/>1. The software on phone will keep reporting that camera isn't connected, and you'll think that something is wrong with it, but actually, this is only because the software can't call home (if it can't, as mine was in an airplane mode and no wifi). You would think the software should report "no network connection", and also, should not try to connect for no reason (I couldn't care less about their cloud, and don't like to be tracked).<br/><br/>2. If you buying this device for Android USB C, do know that it will be a painful experience, because (as someone who replaced several USB connectors on phones) I can tell you that most USB C connectors are in less than perfect conditions most of their life, and yours is likely no exception. It may not be so bad that you'd notice it disconnecting during the data transfer or charging, but it will be already too bad to maintain the connection to Seek Thermal! Why? Because the device is a heavy clump hanging from your USB C port. Anytime you move, tilt, turn your phone, it disconnects. Pay attention to the focusing ring. You touch that ring (as you must, to refocus) and the camera disconnects. If your phone is new right now, and your USB C is tight, remember, that it won't be so tight very soon, and then your hell will begin, probably way out of warranty and definitely way out of amazon return window.<br/><br/>3. The software that runs the camera on your phone is freezing from time to time, and then the camera will just send the empty black picture. I have found that this particular problem comes strictly from buggy app, it has nothing to do with camera disconnections, so it is in addition to the hardware connection issues. To fix this, you will need to delete the app cache every time the black screen comes up, or uninstall, reinstall and reconfigure the app. Enjoy.<br/><br/>4. The camera is NOT ambidextrous. If you are a right handed, you will immediately notice that it is made for a left handed person. It fits in your hand exactly backwards.<br/><br/>5. My Seek Thermal Pro showed temperature readings up to 9 degrees OFF directly in front center two feet away. Nope, not something reflective. Human body, open skin. Think about this, 9! I checked that with certified (yes, I own a certified traceable thermometers) thermometers. I won't start crying about a couple of degrees for this type of device (although this is PRO), but 9? Seriously?<br/><br/>---<br/><br/>If these issues did not exist, I think I would be happy with Seek Thermal Pro. When it works it shows vague low res image of your surroundings in IR. You can see your reflection in a glass screen door in absolute darkness. You can do some work tracking heat leaks. You can diagnose mechanical issues. YOU CAN NOT use this to diagnose modern SMD components. I saw one YT video with someone doing that successfully, but in my own tests and opinion, this is NOT enough resolution. Just like Louis Rossmann says, good ole alcohol does that for a penny and in a jiffy.<br/><br/>I think this should have been redesigned to be:<br/>- used with BT or WiFi, since it has a horrid refresh rate and resolution anyway.<br/>- should be somehow attached to the back of the phone, next to phone camera, because as it is now, the parallax between the phone camera and the Seek Thermal in a split picture mode is just too great.<br/><br/>Lastly, if you buying it for Android with Micro USB, and you checked already that the usb port on your phone is aligned correctly for this camera, you may have significantly more luck, as in my experience, the good old micro USB is nowhere near as prone to disconnect when it gets older and a bit more loose, as compared to the similarly used and loose USB C (way more tiny connectors inside USB-C. A tiny shift is all that is needed to drop the connection).<br/><br/>Nearly $500 for a questionable quality even when it works, which it almost never does? No thanks! There are many other cool toys for us out there.</span>

<span>I've been using thermal imagers professionally for about 30 years.  This Seek unit isn't anywhere close to a state-of-the-art military/tactical, laboratory or commercial unit today.  But, for a cheap, tiny plug-in for the bottom of my new Android phone, it's extremely impressive - I would have thought it had been delivered from an alien spaceship less than 10 years ago (By comparison, I've been expecting real smartphones since before the Apple Newton).  I haven't really used its new near-price competition, the new FLIR C2 or the 2nd gen FLIR One extensively yet, but I'm far more impressed with this unit than the first generation FLIR One (iPhone 5 caddy form factor).  Last year, I was impressed enough with the original FLIR One that I nearly bought an iPhone 5 just to get one (as much as I like and respect FLIR, I'm glad I decided to procrastinate).<br/><br/>First, the image resolution: if you're used to multi-megapixel digital photo cameras, forget about it - that's not what you're getting with the Seek, or any other thermal in a price range less than a Tesla (or two or three, or twenty).  Thermal is about 20 years behind that, dollar for dollar  (image worse than the first Nikon digital I bought back in '93-'94). However, the resolution is about four times what you'd get with the 1st gen FLIR One's Lepton imager.  The Seek image is very, very pixelated, and the long time constant video averaging requires one to hold it it very steady or the image will smear (think 1/4 - 1/2 second hand-held still exposure steady on a conventional camera).  Unlike FLIR's visual/thermal overlay (patented MSX), Seek requires you to swipe back and forth between the thermal and the camera's visual camera images in the app. You can capture visual or thermal, or half and half, but not one on top of the other.  The result is a better thermal image and a better visual image on the Seek that may not look quite as good as the FLIR's MSX overlay as a captured snapshot.  Some of my colleagues think the FLIR MSX approach is better at this price point.  I disagree for now, but I can understand their argument.<br/><br/>Having a pretty low general opinion of the current state of what passes for software engineering, and even lower of Android apps, I can say that the Seek app is better than most Android apps I've used, especially at this level of maturity and adoption (its adoption isn't even a rounding error compared to a Google app).  It installed cleanly on my new Moto G 2nd gen with Lollipop (the cheapest smartphone platform I could find that might support it, as my previous Nexus 4 would not).  It hasn't crashed or locked-up, and it cleanly sends captured images to G-mail or Bluetooth.  The visual/thermal swap feature is useful, as are the various color palates ("Iron" looks cool on ads, and in reports, but I've always used gray scale for serious work).  I don't like the inability to set gain or freeze the AGC (something the new FLIR's app can apparently do), but I can live with that at this price point (for the time being).  Thermal differential sensitivity in a low contrast scene seems to be pretty good - I'll take Seek's claim of about  0.1 degrees C as about right.  I don't expect this to be a calibrated radiometer, or to use it as a substitute for a high quality imager for point medical screening, so I'm not going to get wrapped-up with actual vs. reported temperature values in the app (and no one wants to read a discourse on emissivity variations).  I hope Seek (and FLIR) will have emissivity adjustments and calibration methods in the not-too-distant future (and some education, as I see a lot of misunderstanding and inflated expectation in some of the posts/reviews).<br/><br/>As a usability note: I lucked out with the Moto G 2nd gen; it wasn't listed as "supported" when I bought it, although the 1st gen G was, as was the Moto X, 1st and 2nd gen.  I also lucked out that the USB is oriented in a way that the Moto's visual camera is pointed in the same direction as the Seek, so that a back-and-forth overlay or split is easy.  Not sure I'd be quite as happy if I found that I had to use one of the extension USB cables to orient it with one hand, while holding the phone with the other.<br/><br/>Finally, the imager comes with a cute, really well-designed and constructed hard little carrying case.  I can thrown it in my briefcase, backpack or cargo pant pocket, and not even think about it.  Nice touch!<br/><br/>Bottom line: for those with a realistic understanding of the current state-of-the-art, this is amazing.  If you want to get into the world of thermal imaging at a really reasonable price point, or you're just looking for a cool toy that's about the same price as a high-end 802.11 AC router, it's worth giving this a try.  If you wait six months or a year, there will probably be something better.  But, you'd probably still be using a typewriter and a Western Electric phone if that was the #1 consideration.</span>

<span>This thing is awesome, especially for the price. It can detect temperature differences of slightly less than 1 degree F, so heat leaks or missing insulation is easy to spot. You can see if a vehicle has been driven or an electrical outlet has powered a high-load device like a coffeemaker recently. Powered electrical or electronic devices are also easy to spot--even low-power devices like an inactive cell phone charger stand out. You can see handprints on walls and drops of warm water on the ground for a few minutes--the exact time depends on the size and temperature and wind. It is a true thermal imager; it doesn't need any any ambient visible light at all to work.<br/><br/>Build quality is good; I wouldn't expect it to survive being run over by a tank, use as a hammer, or repeated drops onto concrete, but you don't need to handle it with kid gloves, either, The display has a clear plastic panel over it, and the lenses, USB port, and card slot are all recessed enough to give them a reasonable amount of protection. I would say it is about like a decent-quality cell phone--handle it with a reasonable degree of care and it will last for years, but I wouldn't expect it to handle much abuse. I don't believe it's waterproof<br/><br/>The manual isn't much, but you don't really need it. The menus are simple and clearly labeled, and the screen labels the current function of the buttons. The only thing that isn't clearly labeled is powering on and off--you hold the center button down for about 2 seconds to do that.<br/><br/>The unit will capture still images, but not video--the frame rate is only about 5Hz. I'm sure this is one of the compromises necessary to reach the price point. Capture is simple, just press the right button and the current screen image is saved to the memory card.<br/><br/>Accessing captured images is easy; just connect the unit to a computer with a standard USB cable, and the micro SD card will show up as a removeable external drive.<br/><br/>The flashlight is activated via a dedicated button on the right side of the unit. The button toggles between high power, low power, and off. You can adjust the high and low power settings in the menu. The imager does not need to be on for the flashlight to work. The beam is aimed the same as the thermal imager, so you can see what the thermal is looking at. This helps identify the source of a heat signature when the thermal view alone is not clear. The beam is slightly wider and more diffused than most flashlights, but not so much as to make it useless. If you want to light something up 100 yards away, you should probably use a standalone light, but for nearby things, it works well.<br/><br/>The device is light and compact, and could easily be carried all day.<br/><br/>A few minor annoyances:<br/>By default, all images captured are watermarked with the "Seek Thermal" logo. You have to go into the menu to disable the watermark.<br/><br/>Captured images are overlaid with the same square crosshair shown on the screen, and the temperature in the square. The overlay is always white, so if you are measuring heat sources you cannot see the crosshair or temp reading if the color scheme you've selected displays heat as white. You can't change the crosshair overlay design or color. Fortunately, there are several color schemes to choose from, one of which is a negative B&amp;W that shows heat as black and cold as white.<br/><br/>The battery cannot be removed/replaced without disassembling the device. But the internal battery is sufficient to run it for several hours, especially if you have the screen brightness turned down. You can also connect an external battery to the USB port, and use the device while recharging it.<br/><br/>The unit has an automatic shutoff that prevents battery depletion if you forget to turn it off. But if you aren't periodically pressing buttons while using it, it will shut off without warning. If you plan on using it longer than the auto-shutoff time, take a picture once in a while--any button press will reset the timer. The default setting is 15 minutes, but you can change it in the menu.<br/><br/>The unit comes with a carrying strap, USB charger, and a USB cable, but no carrying pouch. A </span>

<span> is just about perfectly sized, and it has an extra compartment you could use for a cable and charger or spare battery. And you can configure the MOLLE loop on the back as a simple belt loop or attach the pouch to a backpack or tactical vest.<br/><br/>Overall, great value and performance for the price. It has a variety of uses, and could pay for itself just with it's ability to identify heat leaks. 4.5 stars, rounded up to 5.</span>

<span>I have a Flir I7 which, while *dramatically* more expensive than the Reveal, has sort of spoiled me when it comes to actual use.  The Reveal is a beautifully packaged product with a friendly and intuitive user-interface that provides the capabilities most often needed in an infrared imager.<br/><br/>In actual use, it falls a bit short due to it's physical design combined with it's low-resolution imager.  Most IR imagers are like a camera (or like a camera on a stick)--you point the front of the camera at whatever you want to see and look at the screen on the back.  In the case of the Reveal, you point the front of the camera at whatever you want to see and look at the screen on the *top*.  Although the case has a bit of a curve to it, it is not very ergonomic when it comes to figuring out how to point the camera at what you want to see while still being able to read the screen.<br/><br/>This problem is exacerbated by the low resolution image and fixed focus.  Unless you are far enough away from what you want to see such that there is enough information captured to give the image context, it's really hard to tell what you're looking at.  Unfortunately from such a distance, it is often impossible to see the finer thermal details you are concerned with.<br/><br/>Case in point:  I was examining the manifolds of my radiant floor heating system to determine if the heat flow was as it should be.  If I was close enough to the manifold to clearly see whether the individual floor loops were functioning, there wasn't enough visual information in the IR image to tell what floor loop I was looking at.  If I was far enough from the manifold to see all the floor loops, the IR image wasn't detailed enough to determine if the individual floor loops were all working properly.<br/><br/>While I could get the information I needed by very carefully counting the floor loops as I panned the Reveal across the manifold, the simple fact of the matter was, my higher-resolution Flir I7 showed me exactly what I needed to see immediately with no effort.<br/><br/>I don't think the Reveal needs to have a higher resolution IR sensor (which would unduly raise the price), but it is definitely crying out for a decent resolution optical image overlay to add visual detail and provide context for the IR image.<br/><br/>If you can't afford or can't justify the price for a more serious IR imager, the Reveal will do the job in a pinch, but it will take more work and effort to get the info you are looking for compared to a higher-end imager.  If you intend to use an IR imager professionally, I would take that into account.</span>

<span>Seek is doing a great job of making thermal imaging available to the common man, without dropping several grand on a FLIR or Raytheon.  This little unit is a good standalone, but it does lack the features their smartphone attachments have, such as longer distance and clearer imaging, more color filters, and video recording capabilities.  If they would have included the features of the extended range smartphone imager into this unit, it would have been much better.  The flashlight is a good feature, but I would have passed on the light to beef up the thermal capabilities, were I the designers.  It could stand to have a bigger screen.  It's kind of like the Pontiac Aztec of thermal imagers.  Their smartphone imager is better, but this one isn't bad at all for the price.  One does need to spend a bit of time playing with this gizmo, so you can really understand what you are looking at on the viewscreen and what limitations you have with the unit.  I am happy Seek is making such neat innovations in the thermal imaging world, and look forward to seeing what they might come up with next.</span>

The device feels like cheap plastic as long as you don’t drop it and you have to recharge it after couple days. Besides that, I am glad to have it at home to check for leak at my doors and windows, etc..</span>
