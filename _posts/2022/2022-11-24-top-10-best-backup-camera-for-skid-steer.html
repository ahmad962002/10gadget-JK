Wireless IR waterproof camera and monitor. Universal mounting bracket is included with purchase. This unit can be run wirelessly between the camera and monitor or can be hard wired. Great for equipment that is detached from tractors like grain trailers, etc. All electric components are dual voltage 12 V and 24 V. The camera does include the monitor. Comes complete with mounting hardware and swivel arm as pictured. Swivel arm is great for seeing monitor at better angles, and mounts directly to cage for great access.

<span>The camera is great  and we put it in a John Deere Skidsteer.  There were no directions so it was a bit of a challenge  The shipping was great and the camera is working great!  It would have had 5 stars if it weren't for the lack of instruction!</span>

<span>I drive an 07 Avalanche and there are plenty of blind spots. it nice to see where i'm backing up. I chose to plug it in, because there are times i like to see what is behind me as im driving. mostly like to see if the numbskulls rinse the back of the truck as i go through the car wash. very easy install. if i ever buy a new head unit i will hook it up to the reverse wires, because the stereo will have the option to turn it on whenever you want as well. the cords are a bit short to run to the top of the dash. I could run i but i would not be able to conceal the second wire if it was long enough. so i have it in the cup holder for now. not too much of an issue. seems like a great purchase!! I bought a camera a few years ago for another vehicle, and the camera light was on when the camera was, even in the daylight, this ones light only goes on when you need it, at night.</span>

<span>Very impressed for the amount of money I paid for this thing.  Does exactly what I needed it to do for a lot less money than the others choices I had.  Easy to install and so far reliable.  I put it on the rear of an older Toyota Sequoia that did not come from the factory with a backup camera.  My other cars have one and you get used to the utility and safety of a backup camera pretty quickly.  Plus I no longer have to get out of the driver's seat 3 times to line up the trailer hitch ball to my trailer.  That alone is worth the purchase price.</span>

<span>I first purchased a wireless unit, then replaced it for this wired one.  Reason; I did not want to teach everyone to turn the camera on and off each time you use the camera.  If you leave it on by accident, it will drain the battery.  OR you need to run a wire to the reverse light, and then what's the benefit of wireless if you have to run a wire?  My comments apply only for people that want the camera to come on automatically with the vehicle going into reverse, and turn off when the vehicle is out of reverse.<br/><br/>3 main steps:<br/><br/>1) decide where you want the monitor so you know where to run the wire upfront.<br/><br/>2) remove a rear taillamp ( I removed the drivers side) to access the backup light wiring., identify the reverse power wire and the ground.  I removed the rear tail light, and then removed the body plug.  I put my connection on the inside (side) of the rubber body plug.  This way my connections are not exposed to weather.<br/><br/>3) run the wire from the front to the rear.  I ran mine along the headliner.  Some run the wire along the floor, but I think foot traffic could damage the wire....  Whereas along the headliner has no risk of that failure mode.<br/><br/>I took off the trim to the tailgate and ran my wires inside the bundle that goes from the body to the tailgate.  I do not think running the wires outside in the channel between the body and tailgate is a good long term idea.  It's a bit of work, but fishing the wire from place to place was pretty easy.  I ran the wire out to the license plate following the license plate lighting circuit.  I then cut a very small slot alongside the license plate light.  In this way, the wiring is sealed, no water entry risk.<br/><br/>In total, took about 4 hours start to finish.  The only item I needed beyond the kit was about 10 feet of two wire(thin speaker wire), to get from the harness provided to the tail light wiring.<br/><br/>It works.  I cannot comment if it will last, but reviewing the many comments, I did not hear of a durability problem.<br/><br/>The cable provided had plenty of wire, probably 4 foot beyond what I needed the way I routed it.<br/><br/>Overall pleased.</span>

<span>LeeKooLuu did a great job in putting together the LK3 kit. Everything I would need came in the kit (and a few extras for options). So far, I really like this system. It was very price competitive for the performance specifications. It has all the features I was looking for in a backup camera kit.<br/>The instruction pamphlet is reasonable; but there are a number of YouTube videos done by LeeKooLuu that gave me more knowledge and the confidence to proceed. The pamphlet shows a few ways to wire the system. It can be always on, on with the ignition, or (my preferred way) when reverse is engaged.<br/>The camera appears to be well waterproof. That’s one of the “must have” components in my search for a system. I’ve seen some cameras that have shielding; but this device meets the IP69 standard. IP69K enclosures protect electronics from high pressure jet wash and steam cleaning. That’s important when you wash your vehicle.<br/>You can control the system on/off by switching power or by a button on the monitor. It depends on where you tap into the vehicle power supply. I elected to have it work as a reverse gear-initiated backup camera. I was putting the LK3 on my pickup truck so I could get a better feel of where the rear end is located relative to the surroundings. It’s a working vehicle, not my primary mode of transportation.<br/>I mounted the camera over the rear license plate and tested the system before full installation. The 4.3” 1080p LCD monitor worked beautifully producing a bright, clear picture. If you want to change the picture, the monitor has controls for contrast, brightness, and tint. See the world the way you want. I played with the adjustable Parking Grid Line system on the monitor to adjust the lines while I was at the back of the vehicle. That gave me an indication of how they would function when in use.<br/>Now began hard part: how to route the wiring from the tailgate up to the cab. This was definitely the most difficult part of installation. I followed existing wires and harnesses along the frame to the cab. I didn’t have to drill a hole to route the wires internally. I found a pass-through plug that I sent the wires through. Once in the cab, it was a simple matter of removing interior trim to route the wires.<br/>Thanks to LeeKooLuu for providing sufficient wire to complete the routing comfortably. I still have enough wire on the monitor end to place it where I want and enough on the camera/power end to change power supply, should I want. I used zip ties, electrical tape, and rubber grommets (not in the kit, but I’m compulsive). The tape was for wire covering anywhere I though the wires would rub metal and the grommets for pass-throughs on the frame.<br/>The most challenging part had nothing to do with the LK3 kit. It was finding the Hot and Neutral wires on my reverse light. Mine has a non-standard wiring (i.e., the wires were not the colors they should be.) Having my wife at the wheel and a multimeter in my hand at the tail/reverse light solved the problem quickly. I used a military wiring tap instead of the supplied T-taps and sealed the tail light unit back up. Everything worked just as promised. The 4.3” monitor turns on when I put the truck in reverse. All that is left is for me to decide where to mount the monitor. LeeKooLuu provides multiple options for mounting as well, dash or window mount.<br/>Great work LeeKooLuu.</span>

<span>I have only used mine once, and was kind of leery after reading some of the reviews on them about the screen switching views on its own, cameras not staying paired, or lag on the side cameras.  I tow a 26' Jayco Jay Flight with my 2012 Nissan Titan that I installed aftermarket tow mirrors on.  Between the tow mirrors and these cameras, there were NO blind spots around my vehicle or camper at 70MPH+ highway speeds.  Side cameras were very precise.  When the vehicle was just about gone from camera view, BAM!, there it was in the side mirror.  When I wanted to switch lanes, checked clearance in rear camera, verified with side mirror, and smooth, easy lane changes were a plenty.  Will try to break my "backing up using the side mirror" habit this weekend and report back on that, but I am VERY pleased with my set.  Well worth the money in my opinion for the peace of mind.  Very easy to install, also.  My camper is a 2021, and was pre-fitted with all brackets necessary.  Removed 2 screws &amp; dummy block from side markers, sild in cameras, replace screws and lenses, done in 10 minutes for both sides.  Rear camera, remove 4 screws from cover plate, plug in existing power cord, push camera in place, and screw in place to holes for cover.  10 minutes there.  20 minutes total installation, then about 20 minutes to set up the monitor in the truck.</span>

<span>BLUF: I've been using this setup for 5 months and, without including its cost, overall I rate it as just "ok". Factoring in the cost I don't think this system is worth it.<br/><br/>I bought it because my new rv was "pre-wired" for Furrion and for marketing purposes that's excellent but in actuality it amounts to not much more than having power which is not much of an advantage over using any other brand. The picture resolution is average/suitable but the refresh rate is not very good, the video lags and pauses a lot while on the highway. That, I find, makes this system fine while going slow/parking but very unreliable for changing lanes at highway speeds. In addition to poor video quality, the windshield mount suction cup already failed and will not hold its own weight let alone the monitor's too. For the price tag of this system we should be getting better quality equipment.<br/><br/>On a positive note, their support is extremely responsive and knowledgeable. They helped me identify a wiring problem with my "pre-wired" rv's side marker with just a few emails back and forth in one day. (The rv manufacturer "pre-wired" the turn signal wire to an always hot wire so the furrion monitor kept auto switching the view to the passenger side camera...) Good help is hard to find, and isn't cheap, maybe that's why the system is priced the way it is?</span>

<span>I installed this in about 10 minutes on a Rockwood Roo, but the Roo was prewired for the camera. If your rig isn't prewired, there are extra steps you will need to take to make this work for your setup but those are outlined in the install instructions. For the prewired Roo, it already had the black fin plate attached to the back of the rig so I didn't have to drill or caulk anything and honestly it took more time to lug out the ladder than it did to install this whole setup.<br/>The first step is to pair the camera with the monitor, which was pretty easy. Plug in the monitor to the cigarette lighter/adapter in the car, then plug the camera into the split wire connection (the monitor power wire has a split connection that you plug the camera into), turn the monitor on and it pairs. You may have to hit the menu button on the side of the monitor and select pairing, but the whole process was very simple.<br/>Second step was to install the camera. On the Roo there is a black attachment at the top of the back of the rig that looks like the case the camera is in but without the camera. Essentially you remove the camera from the factory case and mount it in the case already on the rig, which is very easy. On the RV case there is a small plate where the camera mounts which is held on by 4 screws, just unscrew the plate but don't lose the screws because they are very small. Then remove the camera from the case it is installed in and plug the camera into the wire preinstalled in the rig, push the wires back into the case on the rig, then attach the camera with the 4 screws. It is really very easy if your rig already has the black fin case already attached.<br/>Finally, adjust the camera to the angle you want and you are set.<br/>The monitor attaches to a suction cup which then attaches to your windshield. The monitor plugs into the cigarette lighter/adapter for power. I added a small velcro strap to the wire to bundle it.<br/><br/>Overall it has excellent picture quality and is very easy to install and easy to adjust the camera angle. You just "click" the camera up or down by moving it and it stays in place. It does not move at all even when going over rough roads.<br/>I used it while driving and had no issue with picture loss and everything was real time. I could see cars coming up on either side of my rig without having lag issues. Also I did not have to "mirror" the image. Cars coming up on the left appeared on the left of the screen, cars on the right appeared on the right, no problem at all. You would just have to double check your connection to see if you would need to mirroe the image.<br/><br/>Now for the "CONS". The monitor and the power cord. I hate cords hanging all over the place and this cord is long. I just used a velcro strap to bundle the excess wire and it seemed to work fine but because they used a bulky ciagrette lighter type adapter plug, it stuck out and kept getting in the way until we got use to it being there. I wish they would have thought about using a USB cord to power the monitor because then I wouldn't have had the huge adapter getting in the way. Honestly though, that would be my only real complaint.<br/><br/>Overall the camera and monitor are an excellent addition to my rig. My only suggestion or recommendation to Furrion is to work on making this iphone/android compatible so that the monitor setup could be replaced using a phone or tablet. But again, this is a great setup for my rig.</span>

<span>I bought this to be able to see behind my RV.  Unfortunately I came to realize this could not be done via bluetooth so I would have to just attach it to my truck.  Having said that, it's still a life changer.  I live in a city and have a big ole truck which is not meant to be parallel parking and getting into tight city spaces; and this really make life so much easier.  My only complaint is that it costs so much for professional installation ($200 in my case) so that's like 4x the cost of the unit itself.  It would be nice if there were a self-install device that wasn't too difficult to do alone, and save the exorbitant install fee.  But the unit works great, and I love having it for the reasons stated as well as when I have too much stuff in my truck bed and can't see out the back, I just put on the camera and it helps a lot.

<span>The image quality and features are good, but nothing to write home about. The standard affair. Yet it costs much much more than other good backup cameras. What you are paying for is the look. This is probably the single cleanest backup camera ever made, I guess the company thinks they have the right to charge for that. Maybe they are right, because I don't regret buying this at all.</span>

<span>What was the designer thinking on this one? The width spacing on the holes is spot on, the height spacing is not. So, you will have to use only the top two bolts or modify both your plate and mounting holes of your car to make this fit. You will also need to modify the plate to make room for the cable. Otherwise, it will be cutting into the cable, causing the camera to short out. And don't think you can just use smaller bolts because this will only accept the painted and easily scratched hex bolts provided, seeing the holes have recessed octagon cavities. Now, after install, don't expect a good quality image on your radio or monitor because it's mediocre at best. Also, the dynamic lines are very inaccurate. For the $125 I paid for this item, I expected much more.</span>

<span>Installed on a 2008 Saab 9-3 paired with a Pioneer AVIC-W8400NEX.<br/><br/>Great low light visibility. Extremely easy to install.<br/><br/>After doing the research, I found this to be the best option for me. Small footprint, good resolution, and able to sustain the elements. It’s pricy but will last much longer than the numerous cheap options available.<br/><br/>Only thing I dislike so far is the dynamic parking lines. I thought they would be nice but are extremely sensitive and do not match my turning well. I’m not sure how they are supposed to know how hard I’m cutting the wheel...so I’ll give a pass. If I barely turn the wheel when reversing and maintain that angle while moving, the dynamic lines shift like I’m cutting the wheel hard.<br/><br/>Again, not that big of a deal. I think you can turn it off by cutting one of the wires (labeled), but I’m unsure if that will remove the lines completely or just turn off dynamic.<br/><br/>There’s not many reviews on this product (anywhere), so I figured I would share.</span>

<span>I installed this kit over a month ago in a 2003 Honda Odyssey and have had a positive experience with it.  The large wide-angle display is an improvement over the prior system I had.  Installation was standard for after-market backing cams - splice the camera's power into the backing light wire &amp; plug the viewer into the cabin's DC.  The camera tilt is an easy screw adjustment under the lens.  The only reason I gave 4 stars instead of 5 is the power cord for the display sticks out too far (should be low-profile) and connects to the left side which means a driver's side annoyance.  When the vehicle is powered but not backing, the display has a blue illumination which may annoy some drivers at night, so you may want to consider not using the included windshield mount and instead get a vent mount or other model that can be located away from your field of view while driving forward.  For other Odyssey owners - I somehow blew the 10A fuse while installing this thing and was surprised to learn how many fuse panels the Odyssey has.  The one for the tail light power is on the left side of the driver's left calf; a fuse puller is in the fuse box under the hood.</span>

<span>Updated 12/1/17: I’ve had a problem with the camera not working, kept on struggling with re-soldering my connections to the back-up lamp’s wires, and just discovered the problem: the wires go to a small plug that plugs into a junction box that is wired to the camera. With vibration, the plug worked loose. Pushing it in again and taping it in place has fixed the issue.<br/>  So this is now going strong around two years after purchase.<br/><br/>UPDATED 9/23/16: Our monitor died. Power comes through the cord, but the monitor is dead. I contacted the company, and here's the warranty situation:  I have to send this back, with copy of my receipt. That makes sense. But I also have to enclose a $15 money order or prepaid shipping label. That means it's going to cost me a bit over $20 for what I hope to be warranty replacement. This is not what I'd call a good deal. Just saying...<br/>  and another update: 12/8/16: Well, I still don't like that it cost me $20 or so for the return, but they promptly shipped my monitor back, or maybe a new one, working better than before. Now after I back out of the driveway, I hit the power switch, and the monitor only rarely comes on when a spurious signal comes its way.<br/>  This purchase had made backing up easier and safer. I'm glad I bought it.<br/>------------<br/>We recently were out of town and rented a car, and discovered what how useful a back-up camera is. Once we'd tried one, it was hard to back up without one.<br/><br/>I checked with a local car-accessories dealer, and they had a nice option for about $300, and an additional $300 for installation. I looked over what it would take to install a wired camera in our '08 Honda Civic Hybrid, and really didn't want to take the time &amp; trouble to run a wire. I can manage basic wiring, but have neither the time nor skills to tear up and replace molding all over my car's interior.<br/><br/>So I researched our options, and this device seemed a good choice. One competing device has the advantage of digital rather than analog signal, but they seem to have a bad track record of non-waterproof cameras with poor response for customer service.<br/><br/>Our camera arrived neatly packed in a display box, with instructions that were general but adequate.<br/><br/>Installation was not difficult, but took a while. I had to open up the area of a backup light, and I chose to solder the two wires to the positive and negative wires. Another option would be quickie connectors one can buy at auto supply stores.<br/><br/>Then I took off the license plate, reinstalled it with the camera in place, and ran the wire over to connect with the gadget that I wired into the taillight.<br/><br/>Then it was simply a matter of plugging the plug of the monitor into the cigarette lighter socket, and clicking the monitor into the flexible mount.<br/><br/>The build quality is excellent. The mount is solid, display sometimes a bit hard to see in bright light, but definitely adequate. The camera turns on when I switch into reverse, and the display is on in about 1 second, about as much time as it takes to release the emergency brake.<br/><br/>The display gives me good visibility in daytime and twilight, and in the dark, the backup taillights provide enough light for the camera.<br/><br/>Now the minor downsides: driving along  in the day, if I leave the monitor on, it has a blue screen that says No Signal. Going by the occasional car or business that's sending the right signal, I'll get a brief flicker on the screen. At night, the blue screen is distracting. The fix: I hold down the power switch for a bit over a second, and the display shuts off. I don't think it's a full shutoff, it goes black with the occasional flicker as I describe above. And if I hit enough of a bump, the monitor does turn on, so I have to repeat the off-switch procedure.<br/><br/>When I need it on, pushing the switch does the job, as will starting the car, and of course putting the car into reverse.<br/><br/>The warranty on the unit is one year, and Pyle gives you a 3-month addition for writing a review. I did contact tech support about that bump-on issue, and got a rapid, helpful response.<br/><br/>I'm really happy with this purchase. I think the value was great, quality seems good. It's good to have this for our Civic, which has pretty good rear-view visibility. Just tonight, I was backing up in a parking lot and the wide angle of the camera showed me two people about to walk behind our car--they were beyond the viewing angle of our mirror. With a van or SUV with limited rear-visibility, this is a safety necessity.<br/>---Update:<br/>Still love the camera kit. There are times, e.g. around dusk, when objects behind the car seem really dark in the monitor, but it still seems adequate for safety. The one thing I wish is that it would stay dark when the gearshift is not in reverse. Best solution I've found at night is just to unplug the power cord that goes to the monitor.</span>

<span>Picture quality is fine.  I received the unit in a timely manner.  However, I tried to install this on a pickup and the cords are not NEAR long enough to get the transmitter close enough for the receiver to pick up a signal.  The box says the cables are 17' long, but I'll eat a bug if they are at all over 12'.  The easiest way I could get this unit to work was to extend the antenna about 8 ft with some fine wire soldered to the antenna stub.  I tried running the cables multiple ways and none of them worked until I extended the antenna.  I had to get the antenna pretty close to the receiver to work.  It probably would have been easier to get a "wired" unit.  It would be nice if the screen had a "time out" feature that would cause it to hibernate after a while of not being utilized.  Seems like that would have been easy to incorporate instead of having a continual blue screen glaring back at you when you are not backing up or when you shut the vehicle off.  I could unplug it from the 12v socket in the dash every time, but who really wants to do that all of the time?</span>

<h2 style="text-align: center;">FAQS</h2>
<h3><h3>Which is better wired or wireless backup camera?</h3></h3>
    

Wireless backup cameras transmit video signals through the air, while wired backup cameras use a physical connection to send video signals. Many people feel that wireless backup cameras are better because they are easier to set up and don't require any extra cords or cables.
<h3><h3>What is best wireless backup camera?</h3></h3>
    

If you are looking for the best wireless backup camera then the Circle 2 is the perfect option. It is very easy to set up and provides a great view of what is behind your vehicle.
<h3><h3>What is the best viewing angle for a backup camera?</h3></h3>
    

The best viewing angle for a backup camera is when the camera is placed at a 45 degree angle to the ground.
<h3><h3>Is rear view monitor the same as a backup camera?</h3></h3>
    

Rear view monitors and backup cameras are not the same. A rear view monitor is a device that displays an image of what is behind your vehicle when reversing. A backup camera, on the other hand, is a camera that is installed in or near the rear license plate area of a vehicle to provide an image of what is behind the vehicle when it is in reverse gear.
