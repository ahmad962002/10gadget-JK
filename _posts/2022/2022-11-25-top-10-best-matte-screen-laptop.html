It boots fast, all the apps I need for everyday basic needs are there and work great (Chrome, Zoom, Docs, YouTube, Messaging). Sorry, Windows, but I haven't had any lockups or crashes. I love that I can use it as a laptop and then fold the keyboard back and use it as a tablet. The touch screen is responsive, and the image quality is crisp. ASUS has done an excellent job with this device. I like the feel of the keyboard and the fact that it is backlit is important too when lighting conditions make it difficult to see. I highly recommend this little laptop/tablet. Solid piece of hardware!</span>

<span>This is my first Chromebook, and I've been using it for two days.  The battery life is amazing so far; it does appear to be 10 hours. Reading the reviews, it seems like a wide range of experiences, and I feel fortunate that mine works well so far.<br/><br/>It was very easy to set up. I saw 11.5 in the description, but the actual display screen is 10 inches. It isn't a touch screen, and the keys are dark gray, not black. This was an impulse purchase after getting a new laptop a few days ago. My 6 year old Dell would work no longer, and I got an expensive gaming laptop. It was my second one, but I was not expecting it to get so hot, with a noisy fan. The battery life is about an hour. To feel more comfortable, I wanted a Chromebook for email, YouTube, and Amazon videos. So, this is doing what I want it to.<br/>I will likely get more used to having no delete key, instead the alt+backspace key is used for that function.  I was surprised when my bookmark bar appeared with bookmarks from 2013 on. I've deleted many of them in the bookmark manager.<br/>My main dissatisfaction is the disappearing vertical scroll bar. In some emails, you can select "view in<br/>browser". I would be more frustrated if I didn't have the laptop available. There might be a fix for that; I haven't researched yet.<br/>I purchased mine when it was 52% off, which is worth it.  Buying electronics is risky. I've been very disappointed in the past, which is why I'm relieved and accepting of the machine I got.<br/>Almost everything has become more expensive, and reasonable expectations seem to be in order. With two days use, I'm not regretting my purchase.</span>

<span>I am one who will buy a product based on reviews and all of the reviews here were giving this chrome book such high praise, I figured it’d be worth a shot.<br/>What did I need? Something slim, lightweight, easy to transport, something with speed and CHEAP.<br/>I was in desperate need of a new laptop b/c mine is a dinosaur, very clunky and sloooow. Being in school is what really got me looking and trying to save up for a MacBook was never going to happen on my student budget. This little Lenovo chrome book is quick, sleek, and slim. And most of all, only $100. No touch screen but the battery life is incredible. I use it a few hours every day and only have to recharge it every 3-4 days. I use this chrome book for Google docs, internet surfing/research and e-mail. With that being said, I’m not using much storage so I can’t speak to that.<br/>GREAT buy as it was everything I needed for an unbeatable price.</span>

It booted quickly, at least, so my disappointment was immediate. :(<br/><br/>I've put in for a replacement, so I'll be updating my review once that one arrives in two days.</span>

<span>Like many of the reviews said, the volume is not very loud, but sound is not something I use my computer for a lot. I have a bluetooth speaker that can give me all the volume I want when I do want it. I think the screen is nicer than what some had described, especially at the price point this computer came in at. Also like many reviews said, the keyboard is not backlit as it is described, unless I'm missing something to turn it on. This was not really a big deal to me, but wish it wouldn't be in the description if it don't have it. Otherwise, I've had it for a few days and am enjoying it very much.

<span>This is my first Chromebook and I love it. The simplicity of this thing is amazing, I have an expensive Windows 10 PC that drives me crazy, I find Windows has become a very intrusive and confusing computer, that bothers you with a load of notifications and pop ups. Trying to figure out how to disable all that stuff is a real pain, Windows seems to bury all those settings, making them hard to find.  This Chromebook is none of that, the ease of this is like using a smartphone. I have absolutely no problem with the screen resolution , it looks fine to me. I can't comment on the battery life because I've yet to unplug it, I use it strictly as a stay in one place computer (plugged in all the time). Google Docs and files take a little getting used to if you never used them, but once you get used to it you'll have no problem. It was not a problem for me because I was already use them on my iPhone . You can't download outside programs because its a closed system, to me , that's a good thing because I only use it to surf the web, shop, emails and files. And because you can't download programs your not gonna pick up any viruses. If you need to edit any photos you can always download a photo app from the Play store. I've found the storage and speed for this to be just fine, it doesn't seem to slow down with numerous tabs open. You have a load of apps to download from the Google play store that should keep you happy. I don't use it to stream movies or play games so I can't comment on that, I'll streams stuff from YouTube with no problems at all. If you want a laptop to do just the basics like I do, then you can't go wrong with this for the price. To me it's way better then one of those low cost Windows PC's. I had a low end Windows PC that I bought  as a extra computer for me to use when my wife is working on the expensive PC, I hated it so much I gave it away before it was a month old. Besides being intrusive and confusing, it was slow as crap. This Chromebook is like having a giant smartphone with a keyboard, (IT'S THAT EASY). The only reason I took away one star is because I think it could of used one more USB port, other then that I love it, and if you use a computer like I do, you will too.<br/>PS. Keep in mind that this model S330 comes in different specs. My review is based on the model with the higher resolution screen  (1920 x 1080) and more memory (64gb). They have a cheaper model called the S330 with less resolution and less memory.</span>

I can write and do some coding perfectly fine and that's how I would describe this chromebook:<br/><br/>Perfectly fine.<br/>Solid.<br/>Reliable.<br/>Lenovo-quality.<br/>I might as well be in one of their commercials, but Lenovo has never failed me.<br/><br/>The negatives?<br/><br/>The screen can be a BIT wobbly when I adjust it, but that's minor. It doesn't wobble when I type, which would make me want to return it. A couple more ports would be nice as well as an SD card slot that allows the SD card to completely insert. This one, the card sticks out halfway.<br/><br/>Battery life is great, can go for hours at the library without needing to be plugged in and I'm using a higher brightness. I'm not doing anything intensive, just chrome tabs, spotify, watching Youtube.<br/><br/>If you need a laptop to take care of your internet needs and basic computer needs, this is a solid one for the price. If you need stronger hardware, then spend at least 400-500. However, if you're already spending that much money, it might be better to get a Windows machine, unless you LOVE Chromebooks.<br/><br/>I love Chrome OS for what it is. Fast, lightweight, and cost-effective. That's the name of the game. If you buy this laptop, or any laptop a this price, then don't expect a thousand-dollar plus experience and then leave horrible reviews. This is a solid chromebook, especially for the price. I'll be keeping this one for a long while and give it to a family member when it's time for me to upgrade.</span>

<span>When I was in college, I was in need of another computer to help with notes and study. I had a nice and expensive computer that did much more than this computer, however, the Chromebook still did a lot of things that any other computer can do and all for a very inexpensive price. My biggest thing that I like about this computer is the price. My nicest laptop was about $2,000, and I love it. However, for families that may not be able to afford such a luxury laptop, this computer did everything I needed it for during college for regularly $279. I notice while I’m writing this review it has went down to $190. For the price, this is a great laptop to do basic work. By no means will this laptop run high quality games or other things that may run the computer too much, but it was great for college activities like writing, studying, and other basic needs. I’m writing this almost two years after purchasing this laptop and the laptop still works great!</span>

<span>So we just got this laptop a couple days ago, and I'll update things as they go along. Firstly it's a pretty decent laptop for the money, trying to read reviews on it is a pretty mixed basket because they have so many other cheap/er laptops that most of the reviews are not for this one. So you'll have to pay attention to the model number they are reviewing. (Acer Aspire 5 A515-56-702V)<br/>Here's a couple of my deciding points which lead to the purchase:<br/><br/>- Aluminum case (not super thick but still not plastic) has a more sturdy feel to it (within reason as this is not a $2K laptop).<br/><br/>- Solid Intel i7 Processor, first came to market Sep 2020. Good sized cache.<br/><br/>- It has a 512GB NVMe SSD drive in it which is the M.2 format, these are some of the fastest drives out right now as far as standards go. Most laptops with SSD are taking about the SATA drives, which while fast, are not anywhere close to the M.2 speeds.<br/><br/>- Being that it's an M.2 drive this leaves an entire drive bay empty in the laptop for future storage upgrade (SATA) if needed or having an alternate backup drive right in the laptop etc. (i.e. expandable in the future if you need it)<br/><br/>- It has 16GB of memory, I'm not sure why so many laptops out there only have 8GB, just running basic windows will eat at least 5GB+ of memory which doesn't leave a lot left for everything else. (In my humble opinion) and I appreciated the ability to upgrade that further in the future if needed to 24GB.<br/><br/>- It has plenty of USB ports and HDMI out for conference rooms/TV's etc.<br/><br/>Some of the cons:<br/>- The power adapter is a very small "pin" power adapter. Needless to say this was rather disappointing because we all know that sometimes cords get pulled or bumped etc. And it's likely to damage the internals because it's very small. I would have liked to see one of the thicker power adapter connections just for strength.<br/>- Windows 11 - Personally I'm not a huge fan thus far but mainly just for functionality reasons like you can't ungroup open programs on the task bar, it's one icon and that's it with no ability to change it. It's not a tablet it's a computer.<br/>- No Thunderbolt Port<br/>- No option to charge via USB C (which would negate the very tiny pin adapter)<br/><br/>So we did run into a couple issues. We had a problem with the laptop not seeing the power cord plugged in, it would blink as if it was going to start working (windows battery page in settings) then act like it was never plugged in. We reached out to Acer and they had us reset the battery via a paperclip and pin hole on the bottom. It's worked find so far after that. Getting a tech on the online chat via Acer support was fast and he was able to quickly resolve the issue.<br/><br/>So generally, this being my very first Acer Laptop, I'm pleased with things so far. We'll see how it holds up in the long run.</span>

<span>I bought this laptop just to have something "mobile" when I want to get online or do some "light work" out of the house (I normally use my desktop computer which is a BEAST!)<br/><br/>I will be using this to watch movies/videos, surf the net, check emails, go on social media and a couple other programs such a OBDII reader that I will use with my OBDII device via wifi or usb to work on my cars.<br/><br/>4GB of ram is good enough for what I will be doing. If I ever feel that it needs a little more power/speed I will add another 4 or 8 but so far it is perfect.<br/><br/>The 128GB SSD is more than enough for what I need and this was one of the key factors that made me buy this computer. Cheaper ones come with eMMC storage which is slower and normally only 32GB or 64GB<br/><br/>It does not have backlit keyboard, I wish it did but it is not a deal breaker and I already knew it didn't have it before placing my order.<br/><br/>It takes about 45 seconds to boot (a little bit on the slow side) but once its loaded it runs pretty smoothly<br/><br/>It came with Windows 11 S More which won't allow you to install anything except from the Microsoft store (I think that's what's called), but getting out of S mode is SUPER EASY, takes less than 1 minute. There are plenty of YouTube videos on how to do that. But, be aware, seems like if you get out of S mode there is no turning back!<br/><br/>In a few words, this is a very good machine for the price. I am not intending to use it for gaming, editing videos or designing. It is strictly for light use (browse the net, documents, watching videos/movies, and a couple of programs that I like that don't require much to run).<br/><br/>It is pretty lightweight, the casing looks nice, the screen is matte and bright enough, the speakers are OK, seems a little bit fragile if you were to drop it or step on it (I am always careful, so this is not a concern). I also like the fact that is a name brand and is not a chrome book!<br/><br/>I don't give it 5 stars because it would've been nice to get it with 8GB and a backlit keyboard. Other than that is perfect for what I need!</span>

<span>I got this for my elderly mother-in-law who uses a computer almost exclusively for emailing. So she doesn’t need a whole lot of memory; 4/64 gigs is plenty of memory. At this price point, it’s a surprisingly attractive and solidly made laptop—comparable in initial quality, fit/finish to a MacBook. By far the worst aspect of this unit is the inclusion of Windows ‘S’ mode. The ‘S’ stands for safety; I have another word in mind! I won’t go into the ugly details here; half of the other reviews will do that. Suffice it to say that I opted out of ‘S’ mode, despite the possible risks/downsides. Many have complained about the keyboard; I see no problem with it whatsoever. Other than the ‘S’ mode issue, the laptop itself may just be the best inexpensive PC I’ve encountered.</span>

<span>This is the 4th one of these that I've bought!  With it being all solid state, battery life is excellent.  Startup is very fast.  I've added a second SSD to two of them with no problems.  It even comes with the necessary hardware to add it.  It's not fast enough for intensive gaming but plenty fast for games like Minecraft, which the kids like.  Being solid state also makes it quite rugged.</span>

<span>This is a good computer and it was the best I could find for my purposes. The only thing I was unimpressed with knowing what I was buying was that it comes with Norton Antivirus. Every windows computer since windows 8 has come with windows defender. Once you uninstall Norton windows defender will kick in. From my experience windows defender is the best antiviral program for a windows computer. It also comes with firefox which I dislike but that's a personal preference. Since its a windows computer it also comes with Edge, another program I dislike. I've never been a fan of windows default browsers.<br/>My other complaints aren't about the computer itself. The screen is much larger than I was looking for and it doesn't detach. The only computers I could find with the detachable screens were chromebooks. Yuck. I'm disapointed in Acer that they don't have the smaller computer with a detachable screen but I'm more disappointed in Windows that not all 11 computers have the touchscreen but with a 15.6 inch screen being detachable and using it as a tablet would be highly uncomfortable. To make a long story short I still use my Acer Aspire with the detachable screen and windows 8 touchscreen to do a ton of tedious stuff I can't do on the new computer. Windows 8 touchscreen was the best program microsoft ever created because it has the capabilities of doing all the stuff I need it to do. Its versatile. Sigh...the computer is nice but I need both computers to do my job.</span>

<span>Purchased this laptop because I didn't want to use my gaming rig for work and other basic tasks.<br/><br/>Build quality is far better than I  expected at this price point. Sure, it would be great to have a solid aluminum case instead of just the top, but that is to be expected for the price.<br/>Took it apart as soon as it was delivered so I could add a 8gb ram stick and a second ssd.<br/>Installation was super easy.<br/>Kudos to acer for adding the ability to install a 2.5" hard drive with provided hardware.<br/>Not many other rigs at this price point that have a second drive option.<br/>You can also upgrade the nvme drive if you want to.<br/><br/>Backlit keyboard is also a huge plus and it is the perfect brightness in my opinion.<br/>Keyboard is comfortable to type on and the addition of a 10 key is another bonus at this price point.<br/><br/>Screen is nice and bright with no glare. Honestly a much better picture quality than I expected for a sub $500 laptop.<br/><br/>It has all the ports you need to get the job done.<br/>2x usb 3<br/>1x usb 2<br/>1x usbc "Out only unfortunately" You have to charge the laptop with included charger.<br/>Lan/Ethernet<br/>Headphone jack<br/><br/>Performance is where this laptop really shines.<br/>I am dual booting the stock windows 11 and linux mint.<br/>Both run flawlessly and super fast.<br/>Hasn't slowed down at all with multiple apps and browser tabs running at once.<br/>Everything runs just as fast as my desktop gaming rig.<br/>Would't run any high end games on it of coarse since it is not built for that and has no deddicated video card.<br/>Pretty sure you could run minecraft or wow/diablo on lower settings.<br/><br/>Battery life is also amazing.<br/>I am getting about 8 hours of usage before I plug the battery in at 30%.<br/>That is with full screen brightness, wifi and bluetooth enabled.<br/>It took 10 hours to completely drain the battery after the first charge.<br/><br/>I would recommend this laptop to anyone that wants a solid rig at a great price for everything other than gaming.<br/>It is also very light for a full featured laptop, so it would be a great choice for school or business for someone that needs/wants to carry around a full sized laptop.<br/>I don't think you could find a better laptop for a student at this price.</span>

<span>This is considered a budget computer, but for us computer geeks, this is the base for several "premium" models. I can't really write a review of the computer out of the box because before I ever turned it on, I installed a 2nd RAM card, then when I booted it, I signed into my account which changed it from Windows 10 S mode to Windows 10 Pro since I have several Windows 10 Pro product keys associated with my account.<br/><br/>With that being said, this computer outperforms what it is meant to do. Is this going to be the strongest computer you can buy? No, not at all. However, this computer has edited large videos for me in minutes, I can use my music notation software on it with no lag or freezing (Sibelius), and it does actually process games at the higher resolutions. I've tested games as demanding as Forza Horizon 4 and it, surprisingly, performs with no issues. It does run hotter, of course, but not exactly "hot". Heavier usage draws down the battery, but that can be said for literally any electronic device.<br/><br/>I purchased this to replace my well-aged HP G60 whatever model that was that I purchased 12 years ago and just kept updating. Up until around July 2020, it was still up to specs to work from home, something I actually bought that computer for 12 years ago. Finally, an update to most of the work at home platforms finally rendered that old beast useless. Ironically, I used the stimulus check from back then (2008) to purchase that computer. With that laptop in mind, I premium laptop to me is one that I can upgrade and repair easily. The HP G60 line did that quite well. Now here in 2020, I purchased one of these for someone else at first. During setup, I noticed the slot to add another SSD, I added the second RAM chip for that one as well since I already knew about that, but I also noticed how easy it was to work on it. We booted it up, put a Windows 10 Pro key on it as well, and from the start, I was impressed with the performance. I was so impressed that I bought myself one.<br/><br/>This thing is super lightweight. The keyboard does have slight smaller keys which takes all of about 20 seconds to get used to. This is because it fit a full number pad on the right of the main keyboard, something that is a must for me with a laptop. One thing I absolutely don't find at this price range is the backlit keyboard.<br/><br/>Spoiler alert: with the backlight turned on for the keyboard, your battery time can be reduced by as much as 50%. You really don't need it if you're used to typing on pretty much any keyboard, but it's nice when you do need it at night in the middle of a shift. The button to turn it on and off is located pretty much at the center of the top row (F keys). Just to the left of that is the button to turn off the track pad. Very nice placement on both of those.<br/><br/>The graphics seems to use a combination of resources that gives you 5 GB reserved just for graphics processing. Not bad at all. This must be what pushes it to be able to do a lot more than expected for this price.<br/><br/>It's nice going into the Microsoft Store to check the system requirements on games (Halo series, Forza Horizon, etc) and not see any red indicating the computer doesn't meet the requirements.<br/><br/>For working from home, this is excellent for those resources that might require a proprietary desktop that you have to load and run via USB. It also has a built in ethernet port, which is usually required for those particular work from home platforms, but it also performs flawlessly on the 5 GHz wifi networks for the rest.<br/><br/>As a digital nomad, I also have to upload and edit and create videos. This thing surprisingly gets through Adobe and other applications with ease and renders videos quite fast.<br/><br/>This was supposed to be a quick purchase for me to replace my aged out HP and then I'd get another good laptop later on, but I'm probably just going to buy a couple more of these.<br/><br/>*Update*<br/>I've noticed two things that improved performance. First, I downloaded the full AMD Radeon Software (it comes with the "lite" version) and that opened up a lot of performance tweaks on both the cpu and gpu.<br/><br/>Also, I'm noticing the battery time listed must be an overall average. When I'm just browsing, watching a few Youtube videos in the browser, and doing stuff like writing product reviews, with the brightness turned down to the lowest setting and with the backlit keyboard off, I seem to get between 9 and 10 hours of battery life from a full charge. Not sure if that's normal for this device, but it's what I keep noticing. Make sure you also turn off bluetooth and location and all that other stuff you're likely not using because those can draw the battery down quickly. When I have the brightness up, keyboard lights on, playing games with the Xbox controller connected via bluetooth, working (headset in, running work platform software), the battery time can be as low as 5 hours from a full charge.<br/><br/>I don't allow any sleep or hibernate functions. Those tend to kill a hard drive. There's nothing I'm ever doing that can't just be saved so I can properly shut the computer down. Sleep and hibernate modes can also do some strange things to batteries, usually causing software glitches that can wreck even the best batteries. They can also cause data fragmentation... all in all, I just don't use those functions on any computer, and for all I know, it could contribute to the better luck I have with laptop batteries and having never had hard drive failure.</span>

<span>Aspire 5 with 4gb RAM 128gb PCIe NVMe SSD drive notes (long, so you may want to skip this review):<br/><br/>Aluminum cover, plastic housing.<br/><br/>Left side ports - Ethernet cable, HDMI, USB 2.0, USB 3.0, Headphone jack.<br/>Right side ports - Kensington computer lock port, USB 2.0.<br/><br/>Notably missing - no port for SD cards at all.<br/><br/>Not a touch screen, but nice in color and clarity. (Opinions on screens and keyboards tend to vary widely - what suits me perfectly may seem to be junk to you, so YMMV).<br/><br/>The speakers on the front underside - the sound is O.K. (for an inexpensive laptop) but volume is lacking.<br/><br/>Power supplied through a proprietary Acer plug, not through a USB-C port.  Cord can only attach to the laptop on the left side (as seen by the user at the keyboard).<br/><br/>Windows "S" is installed; it is limited to running apps available only in the Microsoft Store.<br/><br/>Suggested upgrade - move up to Windows 10 Home.  It's a free upgrade - with the caveat that you cannot return to "S" version.<br/><br/>To upgrade to Home version (instructions as of the date of this review; I assume/accept no responsibility if things go awry.  You may want to Google instructions to verify):<br/><br/>Go to Settings.<br/>Then select Update &amp; Security.<br/>In the left sidebar, click Activation.<br/>Then click “Go to the Store.”<br/>Press the “Get” button under the “Switch out of S Mode” section and in a very short time you'll be assigned the Windows Home version.<br/><br/>Suggested upgrade - if you want to encrypt your laptop you may want to upgrade to Windows 10 Pro or Windows 10 Enterprise.  These upgrades are not free, check Microsoft for current pricing.<br/><br/>The Aspire 5 has a TPM chip so encryption will not require a boot password (not your Windows password).<br/><br/>If you want to set a boot password for the computer (not your Windows password) you can set that in BIOS.  Don't forget it - resetting a boot password on a laptop can be a pain and a half (or impossible) to rectify.  See below on how to get into BIOS.<br/><br/>The included 128GB PCIe NVMe SSD drive is (for me) large enough to hold Windows 10 Enterprise and the applications I use and is quick enough to run them. I'm in I.T. support (although semi-retired) and don't use the Aspire 5 for computer games. YMMV.<br/><br/>Suggested upgrade - add an additional SSD to the computer (screws are in the box, housing and cable required are inside the Aspire 5).  You can Google videos on how to perform the upgrade.  A second internal drive allows you to separate your data from your operating system and applications; if Windows ever has to be completely re-installed your data won't be affected.  If you keep your data in the Cloud you can set the second drive as the sync drive and not fill up “C:” drive.<br/><br/>The chip, an AMD Ryzen 3 3200U, does pretty well for my purposes.  Again, gamers may have a different opinion so YMMV. I've had no issues when viewing training or YouTube videos.<br/><br/>The battery life won't get me through a typical support day without at least some recharge time - Acer claims up to 7 1/2 hours but, of course, that depends on what you're doing.  Watching videos will eat more power than writing a project proposal in Word.  YMMV, but I bought a second power cord to take with me to client offices while leaving the cord  at my home office plugged in. I seem to be getting 5 hours, maybe a bit better, with the screen set to maximum brightness.<br/><br/>The machine doesn't get overly warm in use (again, I'm not a gamer), but I use a laptop board most of the time when the laptop isn't on a hard surface, so there is nearly always some airflow under the machine.<br/><br/>The included 4gb of included RAM is really the absolute minimum to think about with Windows 10.<br/><br/>Suggested upgrade - add a single 4gb RAM chip in the empty slot (Google for videos on that) to bring the total to 8gb RAM. After installing the additional 4gb the computer will report 8gb installed with "5.94gb usable".  The 'missing' RAM is being commandeered by the Radeon software for the display.  If you need/want more the machine can support up to 32gb (1 16gb chip in each slot, discarding the 4gb already installed).  16gb would require 1 8gb chip in each slot, discarding the 4gb already installed.  For business purposes (Office, Chrome and You Tube videos) I'm finding the 8gb (5.94 available) to be acceptable.  YMMV.<br/><br/>How 'easy' the RAM and hard drive upgrades are depends on how comfortable you are working with computers.  I found them quite simple.  Be careful not to crack the plastic housing when removing the bottom cover.  Using the correct plastic spudge is helpful, you can search Amazon for a selection of tools. (spudge = type of plastic or rubber pry bar).  Google the ‘how-to’ videos first.<br/><br/>"Bloatware" included with the computer isn't completely over-the-top, but it does take a few minutes to delete all of the junk.  The "Microsoft Office" included with the Aspire 5 is a 30-day trial version, not a full license.<br/><br/>After uninstalling the bloatware I installed Microsoft Office365 with Access, Adobe Photoshop Elements, DIA (a program for diagramming), AllwaySync (a backup program), Google Chrome, Splashtop Business and Personal (remote access software), VLC Media Player and a couple of network utility applications.  I have 78gb of free space left on "C" drive.<br/><br/>The three small stickers showing Ryzen chip, Aspire 5 inclusions, and Radeon graphic chip that are stuck onto the hand rest part of the computer can be easily peeled off and leave no residue (I was able to rub the remaining adhesive off easily with my thumb).  I don't know why the stickers are there - presumably if you've bought the machine you know what the details are without seeing sticky notes on the keyboard surface.  If they're for advertising purposes in the store it might be more cost effective to print advertising to be placed by the machine rather than label every machine on the production line.  I also found the "Full 1080 HD" sticker on the screen bezel easy to take off.  So I did.  If Acer is interested in putting relevant data on stickers, how about putting the Make, Exact Model Number, Serial Number, and Date of Manufacture on a sticker?  THAT one I would leave in place.  As it is you need to flip the machine upside down to see the manufacturer's information.  (Sorry - this is a pet peeve of mine).<br/><br/>A couple of quick notes for those who are new to Windows laptops - if the keyboard fails to light up, check the F8 key - it can toggle the light on/off.  If you suddenly lose your WiFi connection check the F2 key - that toggles "Airplane Mode" on/off.  Note that the "function" keys are set to use the little icons (F1 is sleep, F9 is mute, etc.).  To use them as traditional function keys you need to hold down the "Fn" key simultaneously.  Fn+F9, for instance, will cause the Outlook application to re-sync when you've got that desktop app open.  If you prefer the traditional function key usage (not having to hold down the Fn key to use the keys within applications) you can toggle that in BIOS.  To get into BIOS, reboot the computer and immediately start tapping the F2 key (no Fn key required).<br/><br/>For me the 'sweet spot' of laptops is in the 14" range (11" for road trips).  That being acknowledged I don't find the extra width or weight of the Aspire 5 to be onerous - the thin screen bezel allows the claim to the 15.6" screen while not unduly expanding the overall size of the laptop.  At nearly 4 pounds it's a bit heavier than the under-three-pounds-sweetness that I prefer but it's not too bad.  Especially after removing the weight of those ridiculous stickers.  YMMV.<br/><br/>If you need more power than this machine has, Acer does offer a similar package with upgrades to the Ryzen 5 chip, 8gb of RAM, and 250gb of hard drive space as well as some other goodies:<br/><br/>https://www.amazon.com/Acer-A515-44-R41B-Hexa-Core-Processor-Graphics-dp-B087N4ZRXV/dp/B087N4ZRXV/ref=dp_ob_title_ce<br/><br/>HTH<br/><br/>Regards,<br/><br/>Jim</span>

<span>This laptop is a STEAL at the price offered. I nabbed the cheapest config for about $380 and spent $30 on a second 4gb memory stick. Just that is enough to make this value laptop better than most of the desktops in the office.<br/><br/>I got this for work, and for D&amp;D so I take it back and forth with me to and from work every day. It's not the slimmest or lightest laptop on the market, but it fits well in my bag and isn't a burden to carry about on the regular (though I'm a 90s kid, I grew up carrying a massive backpack loaded with 80lbs of massive textbooks and trapper keepers, this is nothing).<br/><br/>I upgraded it to 8gb ram but I may actually upgrade again and swap the 4s out for 2 8s because it does struggle a little bit with my work load. I'm an estimator, so I need to have open several things at once including semi-graphic intensive programs for viewing/marking up very large architectural plans, google chrome in various tabs to search for the prices of things and access our office's project management site, and I'm constantly copying/moving/uploading/downloading large files. Outlook, calculator, note programs, etc.<br/><br/>When opening programs I watch the CPU and Memory spike to 60-80%, but the CPU will eventually drop back down to lower % while the memory stays up in the 75-80% range. Sometimes when opening new programs the CPU spikes to 100% and that may be causing the slight lag I get, or when swapping between all these programs. Right now I have 7 programs open while I type this, and my CPU is at 8% and my Memory is at 74% so I think upgrading again, as well as eventually getting a larger drive will fix any such issues. But that is just me and my work load. 90% of the time it runs just fine.<br/><br/>It's quiet, it does not get very hot, and rarely do I even hear the fans.<br/><br/>It was extremely easy to unscrew and open the back and upgrade the ram. While in there I saw where to upgrade the drive so that will be easy too. So getting this for such a low price, making those two relatively inexpensive customizations, and you've got a better machine than most selling for twice as much.<br/><br/>I love the keyboard. I am not one of those people who are obsessed with the clickety of a mechanical keyboard. I actually prefer this chicklet style and I like a bit more squish to my keys. I don't like to make a lot of noise when I type.<br/><br/>A few other things I love - the keys are backlit when typing but shut off after a bit of inactivity. That's nice, especially if running it on battery. The screen is really nice and the colors are great as other reviews have said. I have a mouse plugged in so I don't often use the track pad but it works well and I like the size and placement of it.<br/><br/>Now on to a couple of cons.<br/><br/>First - the sleep key on the keyboard. It's probably a me issue and not really the laptops fault, but I am constantly accidently hitting this thing when I go to hit the 1 button instead. Constantly putting my laptop to sleep.<br/><br/>Second - I love that it has a keypad, especially as I am crunching numbers all day. But I don't like the configuruation. I find it a little difficult to use and months in I still haven't quite gotten used to it. The numbers are fine but I often hit + when I mean to hit * or hit - when I need / and its just a minor frustration.<br/><br/>All in all this is an amazing laptop, and can't be beat for this price. If you're on the fence, looking at other options at around this price range - stop looking and get this one. You won't regret it. I've suggested it to two coworkers and a friend and all 3 have gotten it and love it.</span>

<span>First of all; there is not touchscreen! If your used to one, its tough to go backwards. The laptop is fine, I'm a real estate agent and it is fast enough and gets the job done for the price I'm happy. However, after 5 months the touchpad mouse doesn't work at all. I plugged in a wireless mouse but that can be a pain when you're on the go.</span>

<h2 style="text-align: center;">FAQS</h2>
<h3><h3>Is matte laptop screen better?</h3></h3>
    


Matte laptop screens provide a good image quality and are less reflective than glossy screens. This makes them better for viewing in direct sunlight or other bright environments.
<h3><h3>Which laptop screen is better matte or glossy?</h3></h3>
    

Matte screens are preferred by many users because they don't produce reflections as glossy screens do.
<h3><h3>Is matte screen better for eyes?</h3></h3>
    

There is no scientific evidence that matte screens are better for eyes than glossy screens. Some people find matte screens less tiring to look at, but others find them more difficult to see in bright light.
<h3><h3>Which laptop has best screen display?</h3></h3>
    

There is no one-size-fits-all answer to this question, as different people have different preferences for laptop screens. Some people might prefer a 4K display with vivid colors, while others might prefer a matte screen that doesn't reflect sunlight. Ultimately, it comes down to personal preference.
