<span>Great sounding over ear headphones. Light weight. Only thing that I was unable to use it for an extended amount of time was there is a part of the speaker in the headphones that protruded toward the ear that made it too uncomfortable to use for an ecmxtended amount of time.</span>

<span>Updated Review #5 3/12/2022<br/><br/>Still great! No issues whatsoever. Price is currently $129, I'd do it at that price. No disconnections. Noise cancellation makes my window fan almost silent while not noticeably affecting sound quality. Can't hear the roommates. I'm in my own world with these on.<br/><br/>I use these for watching videos on a PC where I can EQ and raise the volume more than someone with a phone. I use them on my phone too, but my audio player has a way to boost the sound so that I can play them extra loud if I want to.<br/><br/>Updated Review #4 11/10/2021<br/><br/>Still working great after almost a year now, still comfortable. Still 5 stars. I use them every night for several hours. Still holds a long charge.<br/><br/>Updated Review #3 5/27/2021<br/><br/>Still working great, I love these things. Paid a little less than $100. Holds a charge great. Never drops the signal. Ever. I use them every night to watch movies and they're fantastic.<br/><br/>I am no longer bothered by the ear cups no matter how I wear them. Maybe they softened up a little. These are bad ass!<br/><br/>Updated Review #2 1/29/2021<br/><br/>Okay I got these headphones to fit comfortably. I hope I can explain this. Back to 5-stars.<br/><br/>I put the headphones on, then I swivel the cups forward, like putting more pressure near my temple (front of the ear), and less pressure on the back part of the ear (that sticks out from my head).<br/><br/>The mistake is trying to fit them evenly over my ear, or flat against my head. At least for me. The cups are simply too small (they should be bigger!). Making this adjustment makes them fine for hours. I have no discomfort and the sound quality is not changed at all.<br/><br/>I still think the narrow ear design is flawed (I believe I said "stupid" earlier), but the sound quality and price I paid keep these at 5 stars.<br/><br/>And I repeat, for better and louder sound on a PC, I recommend the FREE "Equalizer APO". It EQ's all sounds coming from your computer to the headphones and speakers. Also download another free program called "Peace" to control the EQ easier. Way easier.<br/><br/>Updated Review 1/19/2021<br/><br/>These are uncomfortable after prolonged use. I can watch a movie, but after that it is sometimes a bit painful. The ear pads are poorly designed and I am looking to replace them. They are too narrow, I really don't understand why they were designed this way.<br/><br/>Just looking at them tells you they are not made to fit over the ear of a human being. I just don't see how you can screw up that part of a headphone design. It's dumb.<br/><br/>I paid $99 for these less than two months ago, now they are $146. If I'd paid $146 I would definitely return them, but for the price I paid I'm hoping I can find better ear pads instead. They sound great and I like everything else about them.<br/><br/>I also may have found a way of positioning them so that they are more comfortable, but seriously why should I have to? I shouldn't even know I'm wearing them after a few minutes. What a stupid design.<br/><br/>-------------------------<br/><br/>This is my first pair of wireless headphones and I am very happy with them.<br/><br/>They sound so much better than the cheap wired ones I usually get, and I used to think they were pretty good! I didn't know what I was missing before. Now I can re-watch some movies with incredible sound!<br/><br/>I can see why some people will find the ear cup padding uncomfortable. I may end up replacing them, but if I adjust them over my ears right then I really don't have any problems. They could be a little wider though and I do have to move them a little sometimes. This is the only issue that could remove a star from my review, but like I said, so far I'm fine with it so all stars are intact.<br/><br/>The sound is very clear and they do a good job covering the entire frequency range. I use Equalizer APO for my Windows machine, so whatever I run through the speakers or headphones is custom EQd. That makes a giant difference!<br/><br/>The battery life kicks butt! They last so long I forget to recharge them. it's just not something I have to do very often :)<br/><br/>For the first few weeks I could hit the center of the volume "rocker" button and it would tell me how much battery life I had left. I can't get that to work anymore. No biggie though. It will warn me if there is less than 12 hours left anyways when I turn them on.<br/><br/>The noise cancellation works well. But really the full cup nature of these headphones deal with most noise without the need of electronics. If I wear these with no sound playing I can't hear much in the way of noise.<br/><br/>I could do without the button that handles the track skipping and pausing. I sometimes hit it instead of the volume by mistake and my movie starts over from the beginning. I use a mouse for that stuff so I don't need it. I just take an extra moment to make sure I don't do that. Maybe I can put some tape over it. A lot of people like this feature so I'm probably in the minority.<br/><br/>I paid about $99 for these and I am very happy. They could be louder on the phone though, but my music app has a volume boost that I can use. On the PC I can make them as loud as I want.<br/><br/>I love not tripping over the wire of my old headphones anymore, or rolling over the wire with my chair. Such an annoyance! Wireless is awesome!<br/><br/>The sound quality is very good. Wireless headphones downsample the audio before streaming to your ears, but with these I can't tell. They are also HD in that regard - they transmit a higher quality sound. And if you're really picky you can plug them in with the cord and get full sound. I can't tell the difference.<br/><br/>I had to buy a Bluetooth adapter so I got one here at Amazon. get Bluetooth 5! I had an issue getting all this to work, but once I figured it out they work great.<br/><br/>I did a ton of research before buying these. I look forward to watching movies and listening to music more now. I highly recommend them, they are awesome!</span>

<span>The Headset HD 450 BT Holds well to the head without being too tight or loose. This headset has not fallen off of my head by sudden head movements.<br/><br/>I use this for my PC and when I'm gaming the multi directional sound allows for most games to be played comfortably and the sound quality plays well with music having decent base and a wide range of audio. When On PC Best used with a background filter such as Krisp or NVIDIA broadcaster. These headphones can cause you to hear yourself! Just turn input down. Can be used for gaming, calls and music comfortably<br/><br/>The casing  feels solid and is still bendable without straining it<br/><br/>The sound dampening is much better then expected whether from construction (we had some work done in our house) or from software it does a good job at blocking out background sounds.<br/><br/>Battery life is VERY GOOD and I really wish I can put that on bold letters! Holds charge for a long time and when depleted can recharge very quickly for use in just a few minutes.</span>

<span>I had been stalking a pair of Sony ANC headphones and "settled" on these; I'm glad I did though!<br/><br/>These are comfy, block out noise well passively without making me oblivious to my surroundings, and have really great ANC (I fly a lot). Great for travel or at home.<br/><br/>Sound quality is great! I've got a few pairs of Sennheiser and they never disappoint.<br/><br/>I like the controls on these a lot too; Solid and generously spaced buttons make knowing which does what simple after some quick practice. Volume up and down feels a bit backwards, but that's a minor gripe. The volume button is front to back, and front is vol down with back being vol up.<br/><br/>What I REALLY like about these is how easy it is to pair to different devices. Hold the power button down for an extended period puts them into pairing mode, making it easy to switch from iPhone to iPad to Switch, never having to go to the previous device to UNpair first. This is a little quality of life function that I love.<br/><br/>Bonus is that you can use the provided cable (which in Sennheiser fashion has a proprietary locking mechanism, which is a bit annoying) and use them like a normal wired pair, BUT ANC will not function this way.<br/><br/>Great headphones overall.</span>

<span>After much research, I finally pulled the trigger on 11/22/15 and ordered the top rated Sennheiser RS 175 Headphones over the ear phones<br/>with  Amazon Prime for $245, with no added tax or shipping costs. These were essential for domestic tranquility with others in the house because my new SAMSUNG 4K UHDTV and Soundbar system speaker bass which you could hear all over the house even with a low volume setting of 10.  These got as low as $199  for Black Friday, but I still got a good price on them.<br/><br/>General Comments:<br/><br/>As far as the hookup to my Samsung UN65JS8500 (see my Amazon review)......a couple of things your should know that took me about an hour to figure out which might save you some time and pain. First,  I already had a Samsung Soundbar on the 4K UHDTV which ran off the single optical out from the one-connect mini box.  These headphones are not Bluetooth but have their own wireless frequency transmitter direct to your headphones up to 100 meters away depending on your walls. You don't have to pair them up with the UHDTV and you can get a second pair of them for a viewing companion. They are great phones but you need to set them up special on this Samsung:<br/><br/>1. Split the Optical out into 2 cables if you have a soundbar. Get the Toslink Digital Optical Audio Splitter 1x3...1 input to 3 possible output devices. The VHD-TS1X3 will cost you around $25 on Prime or at stores like Fry's. Also purchase a 1 meter optical cable from your one-connect mini box to the splitter input port for about $10, Then you will have A, B, or C output ports and supplied cables from the splitter to your soundbar, headphones, and one additional device if you need it.<br/><br/>2. On the Samsung Menu Sound Option. Very important, as it took me an hour to figure out what settings to use as my first hookup with the headphones was dead silent and there was nobody to help me at Samsung or Sennheiser:<br/><br/>a. Sound Mode: Up to you, but I like "Movie" for the better base in most movies and 4K series on Prime or Netflix.<br/><br/>b. TV Speaker: Stay with SoundBar (if you have one) or TV speakers....not Bluetooth, or Optical Out options.<br/><br/>c. Additional Settings: HDMI Out:.....set to PCM and Audio Format: also set to PCM. Headphones require PCM format on UHDTV.<br/><br/>Once you do this, the headphones and the soundbar will both send out fantastic audio simultaneously......so you must mute the soundbar (or regular TV speakers) to eliminate any echo effect time delays....but fiber optic is so fast you should not hear any. My Audio delay is set to 100 ms with my HD Audio: OFF. You may need to play with these depending on your speaker/Soundbar setup.<br/><br/>PROS:<br/><br/>1. Great sound fidelity and reproduction.  No noise once you put them on.  You hear voices and stereo sound effects you can't hear from<br/>standard UHDTV speakers or soundbars which adds to your viewing experience.<br/><br/>2.  I can take them to any room in the house within 30 feet upstairs or downstairs and not miss a sound.  No sound dropouts anywhere,<br/>even the garage, bathroom, or outside.<br/><br/>3.  Fairly easy to setup once you have your optical cable or stereo audio cable setup and your sound source menu options setup properly<br/>for the Sennheiser.<br/><br/>4.  Nice to have the transmitter post nearby to charge the headphones when not in use and red/green charging indicator status.<br/><br/>5. Good reference CD.  I suggest you print out the entire 32 page instruction manual before you start the setup or view the PDF.  You can still read every page if you double up to print 2 pages per sheet for 16 pages with landscape format.  It will take you 10 minutes to read it.<br/><br/>6.  Nice to confirm your current BASS BOOST or SURROUND SOUND setting lights on the transmitter post if within view.<br/><br/>7.  I am still experimenting with BASS and Surround Sound settings Hi and Low for movies, normal shows, and music channels.  So far, I like the just the extra BASS BOOST setting for movies.  You need to experiment for yourself.<br/><br/>CONS:<br/><br/>1.  Headphone batteries:  Swap out the supplied AAA batteries with the Energizer AAA rechargeable batteries, which charge up much faster and last a lot longer than the German supplied "ReCyko" batteries. You need 1 battery in for the left and right side headphone. Volume controls, + or -, base high/low, and surround sound buttons are on the right side headphone, which take a while to get use to. Don't use your remote or you will unmute your soundbar or TV speakers and alert others in your house and defeat your headphone privacy.<br/><br/>2.  All controls on the right earphone.  Very nice if you are right-handed or ok with your right hand if left-handed.  The other problem is that the 4 main quadrants of the control circle:  BASS,  SURROUND SOUND,  VOL -, and VOL +, are basically on a flat surface, and  unless you have a mutant eye or good tactile feel on your right thumb, you really can't feel which control is which.  The first few days, I had to take off my headphones multiple times to see which control I was touching.  Problem solved:  I got some 3/8" round soft felt tabs with a stick-on side on each control.  The BASS and SURROUND tabs are a little thicker than the sound control tabs, so I could feel, where I was on the control circle.  All I had to remember was the BASS was to the left of the SURROUND control and that VOL - was to the left of VOL +.  Sennheiser should improve this ergonomic problem with future models.<br/><br/>3.  Break-in pain.  I have only had these headphones about 2 weeks, and even with the padding around the ears and on the top of my head, there is definitely a dull throbbing pain around my ears once I remove the headphones after about an hour of viewing.  There is  no way to adjust the tightness of these phones on the sides of your head.  However, as others have suggested, it might take a month or so of normal use to loosen them up...or maybe you can stretch them out over a large wooden block when not in use.<br/><br/>I may change my 4* rating to 5* in a future review update if the pain issue resolves itself or my head shrinks.  We'll see.</span>

<blockquote><em><div class="a-row a-spacing-small review-data"><span class="a-size-base review-text review-text-content" data-hook="review-body">
<span>Comfort and build: comfort is lousy because the cups are too small.  I can't wear them for too long because my ears will get sore.  If they were just slightly larger this would not be an issue.  My ears are not that large, so unless you have small ears this might be an issue.  The button layout is terrible, too many similar buttons and the power button is hard to reach.  Build wise, it is all plastic but feels well designed and durable.<br/><br/>Noise cancelling: THIS DOESN'T HAVE IT!  There are so many trash reviews right now.  Look the 450 model has ANC, the 350 model does not.  Don't be fooled by those bad reviews.  I intentionally bought this model over the 450 because from experience I know that Sennheiser does not do good ANC.  Sony and Bose are where you look.<br/><br/>Sound quality: above average for wireless headphones.  The bass is muddy and never impactful.  The mids are overly recessed and the treble is too much.  It gives the headphones a dull, thin sound.  A bit of an exaggeration but it is like listening to AM radio.  It is NOT at all the Sennheiser house sound (rich warm, dark and highly detailed).  It is also not terribly detailed.  But it is better than most wireless headphones that have that consumer-grade sound of incredibly flabby, muddy mid and upper bass boost.  The best I've heard are from Beyerdynamics, AKG and Audio-Technica but their offerings are much more expensive or lacking in features or are poorly made.<br/><br/>Comparison to the 4.40: this headphone is the spiritual successor to the 4.40.  The 4.40 was a terrible headphone.  It had an audible noise floor (I listen to classical music at low to mid-volume so the hiss was always present).  It had poor support for codecs and did not have much in the way of volume or dynamics.  Finally, the 4.40 took micro-usb for charging.  This headphone is much better.  Sennheiser clearly redesigned their wireless headphone.  There is no noise floor on the 350.  It supports nearly every codec you can think of.  It uses bluetooth 5.0 and has usb-c with fast charging.<br/><br/>Verdict: at $100 you can't do any better.  It has the best sound quality, build and features at that price point and comes from a name brand.  Notice I didn't praise it to the moon.  Temper your expectations.  It is impossible to find great SQ or great NC on wireless headphones without setting a pretty steep budget.  And there are no wireless headphones that hit both out of the park.  It is unfortunate that Sony and Bose have such great ANC but such lousy SQ, and all audiophile brands put so much effort into SQ but almost no effort into NC.</span>

<span>I have very sensitive ears and usually have to take of headphones - even in case when they are over ears but press some part of my ear to head. These headphones are real over-ear and I can train in them for 2 hours non-stop. Noise cancellation is about 80-90% but It's what I need to at least keep track of what happening around me. The noise that gets through is low and doesn't bother or interrupt my training. Love it!</span>

<span>Let me start by saying I am an amateur audio enthusiast that loves a balanced and detailed sound signature.  I don't care about making phone calls or active noise cancellation (ANC).  For the most part, I wear headphones in quiet places to listen to music and ANC usually messes up the sound signature anyway.  Just give me good audio with passive noise isolation and I am satisfied.  Second, I don't care for the bloated bass you find in most consumer headphones.  Just let me hear what was recorded with clarity, detail, natural tonality, and a great sound stage.  I've spent a modest amount on DACs, amps, earphones, and headphones to deliver the kind of sound that makes you remember why you love music so much.<br/><br/>But there are times when I just want to kick back and relax and not be tied down by wires.  My solution to date has been EarStudio's ES100 and a good pair of IEMs.  The AAC codec from an iPhone using high-quality music source (FLAC, Amazon Ultra HD) with high-end in-ear monitors sound reasonably close to my wired Drop HD6XX or Hifiman HE400i cans on my Schiit stack.  I had tried a few over-ear Bluetooth headphones but nothing has ever sounded even close to what I consider high quality audio.  Either too much bass or an ANC system that interfered with the audio signature (on or off).  Nothing met my amateur audiophile aspirations.<br/><br/>That is until I got Sennheiser HD 350BT.  After reading a few of the reviews, I almost didn't order them.  But for under $100 I decided to take a chance.  From the first listen I was blown away by the balanced sound signature.  Not that far off from the Sennheiser house sound signature.  After 20+ hours of breaking them in, the bass has opened up just a little and the mids are still wonderfully natural and perfectly placed evenly in the mix.  And while these are not as good as a wired over-ear headphone on a high-quality dac/amp, for a wireless audio headphone solution these come close enough to free me from the wires and not feel like I am missing much.<br/><br/>The bass is solid from sub-bass to mid-bass without muddying up the lower mids.  These are not consumer bass-head cans with bloated bass.  You can feel the thump of bass drums and toms on ears.  The bass is present way down into the frequency range, but there isn't an overpowering slam nor is it the star of the show.  But it is clean and surprisingly detailed.  And the sound app EQ settings, which is too simplistic, still let's you bump the bass some if you need a little more.  Listening to Marcus Miller on Laid Black is great for illustrating how well these handle the lower frequencies.  Miller's bass solos are a pure pleasure listen to.<br/><br/>Mids are where many headphones fall short - either missing the natural sound of voices and instruments or placing them behind/under the bass and highs.  Yet this is where much of the audio is in most genres of music.  Voices, guitars, strings, woodwinds, brass, and snares/toms bring the bulk of audio that is to be heard.  The HD 350BT shines here.  Sennheiser really shows they know how to shape a balanced sound signature around high-quality mids.  Listening to Boney James on Future Soul I heard a natural and realistic alto sax sound that is so, so good.<br/><br/>The highs are also very good and actually somewhat relaxed for Sennheiser.  I prefer just a little more air and sparkle, but even without EQ these are delightful.  However, using the very-basic EQ settings in the Sennheiser Sound Control app I was able to bump the highs to add exactly what I was looking for.  Cymbals and triangles ring clear and the detail and imaging provided is very good for Bluetooth wireless audio.  No distortion, sibilance, or feel of grainy treble.  You can hear small details of instrument decay, reverb, and echoes in the room.  Listening to the Marcin Wasilewski Trio with Joakim Miller on Spark of Life, I was able to hear the detailed clicks of drumsticks and subtle crash of cymbals of Michal Miskiewicz's excellent musicality on the drums in each song.<br/><br/>But what I love best about the HD 350BT is the excellent dynamics and sound stage.  I'm not sure how Sennheiser worked their magic building a digital audio decoder and amp into a headphone that delivers such an excellent sound stage.  But I am very happy they did.  They sound equally good at low volume or high.  Overall dynamics from soft to loud is incredible for a wireless audio product.  The stage is wider than average with a good bit of depth and height.  They detail of the highs provided just enough air give that sense of spaciousness and realism I really enjoy.  It really put these over the top for me.<br/><br/>Note that these are not the loudest headphones and to get these cranking they need to be in excess of 75% volume, which does not leave much room at the top end.  But given the excellent passive noise isolation, they are more than loud enough for most, even in a moderately loud environment.  The Sound Control App is marginally useful.  The EQ works, but is essentially a three-band equalizer that can be toggled between a hard to use visual representation or a linear hi/mid/low band setting that is easier to use.  I do wish that Sennheiser could have provided a 5 or 7 band EQ.  But as I said it works - just could be better.<br/><br/>I also found the HD 350BT headphones to be very comfortable and can wear them for hours at a time with no discomfort.  That said, the ear pads are soft but somewhat small and could be problematic for someone with larger ears.  The build quality is solid despite the plastic material used for the majority of the body.  They also look great in black to me.  But don't expect frills, a case, or even a bag.  The focus at this price is on a great audio, not accessories.<br/><br/>If you are more of an audio purist, love the natural sound signature/tonality of Sennheiser products and don't care about ANC, then these are a huge steal at under $100.  Forget the HD 450BT and it's ANC, get these instead.  And no need to spend $300 or more on Sony and Bose.  Spend your money on great audio.  These simply sound great!</span>

<span>They are great sounding earbuds. None of the noise that some of these neckband sets have. They are not noise canceling, but only sound isolating. With the foam nozzles they do block ambient noise quite well. Unfortunately the foam nozzles are also very delicate. These are not the "toss them in a rucksack" earbuds, they should be kept in the (included) case when not in use. The cords are a bit long and dangle too, so take care if you are doing anything strenuous or they could be easily damaged.</span>

<span>I wanted cordless hi fidelity earbuds, but had some budget limitations. These met my needs expectations to a degree. When they are used with the cordless neckband, they are only OK. They simply don't generate the volume I was looking for and the battery life is only so-so. And the neck band isn't as liberating as having fully wireless, independent ear buds. HOWEVER, they are convertible for use with a cord. While this eliminates the cordless feature, it also eliminates the battery life issue. More importantly, the sound is superb and plays notably louder. Bottom line: get 'em for the sound quality, but get the connection cord so you can utilize them both ways.</span>

<span>These used to sell for $500 and when i saw them on sale for $120 i grabbed them since Sennheiser is a trusted brand in my world and thought i scored with these.  First of all the app simply does not work with android and this set.  I have many other bluetooth items and headsets that work fine but not these.  So i had to just do a normal bluetooth join and that worked.<br/><br/>Second is the horrible battery life.  My old set both cheap and high end can last me a day and more importantly a flight either 2hr or 4hr no problem.  These can't even last a flight of 1:50mnin and i can't tell you how many times i went to go grab them only to have the battery completely dead.  Then, reached in a bag i hadn't opened in like a week and grabbed my Shure's and they still worked.  I don't think this is a Sennheiser problem but rather a  IE 80S BT issue.  It was probably a dud and why they started selling them a 5th of what they originally started out at.<br/><br/>Their not worth it move on!</span>

<blockquote><em><div class="a-row a-spacing-small review-data"><span class="a-size-base review-text review-text-content" data-hook="review-body">
<span>I'm coming from the Sennheiser Momentum 3 Wireless headphones that I've been using for basically everything over the past few years. I bought these new headphones primarily because of AptX-Adaptive, their glowing battery life, and the fact that my M3W were starting to wear down a bit.<br/><br/>Let me reiterate; I use these for EVERYTHING. Everything from my phone, iPad, multiple PCs, planes, etc. etc. If you want to use these on PC, I strongly suggest in either an AptX or preferably an AptX-Adaptive transmitter (see the Creative BT-W4) to avoid unnecessary latency. It's an absolute must if you're gaming though you will lose the ability to make calls.<br/><br/>Regardless, these sound fantastic. I had no complaints about the M3W and while these aren't a significant upgrade, they do sound clearer and more crisp. The build quality is tricky. On one hand, they lack the metal frame that the M3W had that made them unique and confidence-inspiring. These are almost entirely plastic and their uniqueness has been subdued that it can easily be mistaken for countless other pairs. That being said, they feel solid and the plastic does not feel ready to snap at any point. The earcups in particular are an upgrade in both fitment and leather quality. They lose the ability to fold like the M3W but instead you get a slim HARDSHELL carrying case. I get why some people are against them no longer folding but as someone who constantly takes them out of my backpack, I LOVE the slimmer case.<br/><br/>The capacitive touch functions I'm not sure how I feel about yet. The only physical button doubles as a manual on/off and a pairing button. The rest is controlled by the cover of the right ear cuff. Most of the functions are fine and intuitive, but to switch between ANC, off, and transparent hearing, you need to do a weird pinch like you would to zoom on a touch screen. It's particularly weird because there's multiple levels so you need to do it multiple times. I'm sure I'll get used to it but I would've preferred a physical button or switch like the M3W.<br/><br/>ANC is good. It's NOT as good as Sony's but it's not far off. I can't say much about the battery life as I've only had them for a day but all reviews are backing up Sennheiser's claims of 60h which is literally class-leading. The Android app for fine tuning settings and EQ is fine. Nothing to write home about. Multipoint connection (pairing to two devices at once) is back though it's not a feature I intend to use very often.<br/><br/>All in all, I'm very happy. They're expensive but the price is competitive with their rivals. The main draw for me towards Sennheiser has been AptX support. It's something that most of the competition is missing and as a large amount of my usage is gaming, it's absolutely necessary. But the sound quality is great. The features are great. I'd highly recommend these if you're in the market.</span>

<span>I loved these headphones (Momentum 4). It quickly became my favorite, even better than the Sony MX5. The sound was awesome with a full spectrum down to the deepest base without muddy low frequencies as with nearly all other headphones including the MX5. I used these every day for just over a month to put me just out of Amazon return window. Suddenly the right speaker started crackling and popping. I was in such disbelief that this was happening. It was so sad for me that I couldn't listen to them anymore. I was very disappointed, and I really wanted them to work! So I ordered the another pair from Best Buy, and I ordered another from Amazon. Yeah, I really wanted these to work! The same day the Best Buy pair arrived and I started listening to them, it took about 4 hours before this one like the other one started crackling and popping, except it was not as bad, and it was in the left speaker. I was so much more disappointed! Fortunately I was able to return this one to Best Buy right away. I also cancelled the second order from Amazon. I really want to know what's up! I tried everything to make the crackling and popping go away. I restarted my phone, updated the headphone firmware, nothing worked. Now I have a broken pair and I guess I should use the 2-year warranty to have Sennheiser fix it or replace it. Can't return them to Amazon. If I could trust that the next one I receive will last, I would go ahead and get another one right now. Just so you know, I collect Bluetooth headphones, and I have over 30 pairs including the best of Sony, Bose, and other premium brands. I've never had an issue with any of these other pairs. This sucks! My rating of one star is solely due to this issue with two separate pairs. If the pair worked, I would rate them a solid five stars! They are AWESOME! There hope this issue can be fixed. I want my Sennheiser Momentum 4 back! One star should elevate this concern so that others are cautious when they buy one, and know that it may fail within so many hours of use. Sennheiser please make this right for me.</span>

<span>Sound quality on these is GREAT - No complaints whatsoever. Music sounds good, TV dialogue is easily understandable, full range of sound is audible. Mic quality is good, but not as top of the line as the sound.<br/><br/>Battery life is pretty in line with what's advertised. Expect to charge at least twice weekly if you use your headphones heavily.<br/><br/>I'm not crazy about the touch controls. They seem finicky to me, and don't give you good feedback. Instead of being able to adjust transparency on a percentage scale, I'd much rather have a quick switch for going between fully transparent and fully noise cancelling.<br/><br/>I had some problems initially with pairing and set up. When connected to my Windows 10 PC, they appear as two different sound devices - Headphones &amp; headset. Quality when connected as a headset is terrible, so make sure it's connected as headphones. Headset connection can be disabled in output devices if it's connecting the wrong one as default, but make sure it's left enabled in the input devices list or you won't be able to use the microphone.<br/><br/>The app is...Not great. No desktop version as far as I can tell, so you have to control it from a phone or emulator. I ended up turning off almost all of the app features. Auto adjusting noise cancellation didn't seem to work properly, and I have no idea what "Comfort calling" is because most of the app features don't have descriptions (This one isn't listed in the manual either). On head detection has annoyed me with every device I've ever had it on, but I'll concede that before I turned it off this was the least terrible implementation that I've experienced.<br/><br/>Initial pairing experience was troublesome, but now that all my devices (Desktop, laptop, phone) are paired I'm able to transition between them all pretty smoothly. Occasionally I'll have to turn bluetooth off on one device or another because I'll get continuous "Connected/Disconnected" messages while listening on a different device.<br/><br/>Bottom line, if audio quality is your most important factor in looking for headphones, you'll probably be happy with these - I definitely am. That being said, they aren't the most user friendly headphones currently. I'm hoping that software/firmware updates might improve the experience, and I'll update this review if that happens.</span>

<span>I am really hesitant to write a review in light of how many people have left reviews that sound like they would give their first born for these things.  I am not in that camp.  I have several sets of over-the-ear and in-ear headsets including the Apple Airpod Max and the new Sony MX5.  Having used equipment from Senn for 30 years, I am familiar with their products and how their philosophy, so many others, has changed over that time with a leaning towards mass market.  Oh, I get it...make money or close the doors.  All that said, here is my real world experience.  Upon opening them, I like the case, the wired adapter, etc.  The headset is lightweight and very comfortable, even when wearing with glasses.  That said, they are the "cheapest looking/feeling" headset from Senn I have ever seen...they really feel like cheap plastic crap...but that is not why you buy a headset.  Just setting expectations here.  The battery life claim of 60 hours is absolutely comical - I have been getting more around 12 hours (calls/music/online meetings - almost all with ANC).  The ANC itself is not at the level of Apple or Sony.  It works, and I have been on a couple flights with them.  There does not seem to be any background noise filtering on the microphone side though - certainly not on par with Apple or Sony, though the ANC works well enough for the wearer.  Max volume is lower than other brands, if that is important to you, but certainly loud enough.  Bass response is significantly BETTER than Apple or Sony, though the sound quality as a whole is muddier with less staging than others.  The pairing has been fairly smooth - no where as seamless as say the Airpod Max's if you are in an Apple ecosystem, but on par with most other brands.  The app is a bit pointless, but given that the single button and touch controls arent the greatest, it is helpful.  For example, the pinching/reverse-pinching to engage ANC sort of works...? I did have my first pair of these die after about 10 hours of use - would no longer pair and the lights just did a non stop light show - but got them replaced through Amazon without issue, as I had them only 2 days.  Conclusions? Given that the Apple product is always on sale for $100 off, the price point between all three products (The Sony MX5's, the Airpod Max's and these) are within $100 of each other, I would have a hard time recommending these to friends or family.  I really cannot find a single compelling reason to select these over competing products.  I mean, they are bad by any means, just bland.  They don't stand out from a looks, sound, ANC, build quality, functionality, or any other way...they work, well enough, and in the class they are in they are fairly priced.  I honestly feel you could do better with the Apple Airpod Max if you are a big Apple user or the Sony MX5's otherwise - and be happier with either of those versus these.  In fact, if plastic, lower quality builds, but with good sound, good bass response and decent ANC is your thing, you could do better with the over the ear model from Status Audio and save a couple hundred bucks.  Of course, all of the above is my personal opinion, not paid, no free samples, no fancy audio test equipment...YMMV.</span>

<span>To understand where I'm coming from, I do not need these to be amazing earbuds in the way of audio. I needed earbuds that stay in my ears while I'm riding the train, or walking around. That being said, I always prefer better audio than worse audio. I don't have any complaints about the audio. The last time I have used similar earbuds was over four years ago with the Jaybird X2. Personally, I don't feel like this technology has improved much since then.<br/><br/>Compared my memories of the Jaybird X2 from over four years ago, I have several big complaints in terms of usability:<br/><br/>1. The bit in the middle. The heaviest part of these earbuds comes in the very middle of the wires. This guarantees that this thing will be weighted straight downwards between your ears. This makes it so that whenever you move your head, this thing will move around like a pendulum going everywhere. Also it moves uncomfortably behind your neck if you do decide to move it around your neck.<br/><br/>2. The wires are too short to wrap around your neck, or have any way to keep the said bit in the middle from going everywhere. I would prefer if I could do  so such that even if one of the earbuds fell out, it wouldn't swing into oblivion with nothing preventing it from falling out other than a single other earbud stuck in my other ear.<br/><br/>3. A lack of a provided clip to keep it out of the way to dangle. Even if there was a clip, between the shortness of the wire, the dangly middle bit, and the volume control part, there wouldn't be a very good place to clip anything.<br/><br/>4. I suppose this is specific to switching from the Jaybird, but the fins used to really help keep the things in my ear.<br/><br/>My conclusion: It sounds fine, but there are enough small quirks that annoy me enough to wish I bought something else.</span>

<span>This is my first set of premium ear buds by Sennheiser. I prefer their over ear headphones, but I needed something more suitable and subtle for video meetings that are required for my WFH setting.<br/><br/>The pros that come to mind:<br/><br/>-Noise cancelation. I currently have a personal server running 24/7 in my office, and it sounds like a small plane engine. These ear buds completely eliminate the shrill whirring. The clicks of a mouse and keyboard keys are still faintly audible from time to time, though.<br/><br/>Sound quality - The sound stage on these is fantastic. There is a little sacrifice to the quality of sound with it being an in-ear device (think sounding a little compressed and less spatial in a way),  but the mids are warm and the highs are crispy (sometimes in a way that feels like your skull is getting a nice scratch, so if that's too much you can adjust in their app). The bass is fairly restrained by default, but you can adjust that in the app as well. If you like music that is bass-heavy, these might not be the best fit for you.<br/><br/>Controls - the controls are simple, and I love that they can be customized to my  preference in the app. The auto-pause to music when taking out the right ear bud is a huge plus for me!<br/><br/>Cons:<br/>The ear bud tips - the M3s come with various sized ear buds, but unfortunately (for me anyways) they get pretty uncomfortable after about 4 to 5 hours of wear. I wound up switching to aftermarket bud tips as I found myself fiddling with the buds in my ears a lot to the point where the inside of my ears started to chafe. The other issue is that the ear pieces will slowly come loose or fall out if you are talking or eating with them in. I primarily use the M3s for stationary/desk work, so this isn't the biggest dealbreaker, but I don't feel that they would be ideal for use with working out or any activity where you're moving around (or talking) a lot.<br/><br/>Bugs - The M3s were a little bit of a pain to initially get connected to the app, but once they were set up I have had no issues there. The app immediately prompted firmware updates once connected. The only problem I seem to have is that if I take a phone call and hang up my left ear bud will stop working, or the noise cancelation will stop doing its thing temporarily. I have to return both of them to their case and reconnect them to my Bluetooth for both the left ear bud and noise cancelation to work again. Hopefully this is fixed in a future update.<br/><br/>Overall, I've been very happy with the M3s, and they get pretty heavy use from me. I've been consistently wowed by the quality of sound these bad boys put out! Perhaps one day Sennheiser will come out with some comfort ear tips, but in the meantime I continue to be pleased with my purchase.</span>

<span>Initial Review: May 21, 2022:<br/><br/>Before I start, I like to begin mentioning that I believe that any good quality earbuds/earphones should reveal the sound(s) for what is was originally and naturally intended, thus it should not reproduce the sound artificially and/or overwhelm the integrity of the original intended sound.<br/><br/>Everyone will have their different opinions and feedbacks; everyone all has different standards and expectations, so something to consider when reviewing my review.<br/><br/>Whenever I write my reviews, I make sure that I'm mindful with the length of my reviews as I understand that some of us don't like reading long reviews. So, I try to be as straight forward as possible, while still trying to also be detailed.<br/><br/>My reviews are more based on usage, so if you're wanting a review with technical specs/data (i.e., exact dimensions of earbuds, driver size, frequency range, total harmonic distortion, etc) and other technicalities, then my review might not be good for you. However, if you want to know if the Sennheiser Momentum 3 (m3s) true wireless earbuds (TWE) might be good or bad for you, then here it is.<br/><br/>If you are simply wanting to know how the m3s compare to the Sennheiser Momentum 2 (m2s), then fast forward towards the end of the review.<br/><br/>I've categorized my verdicts into 7 categories: (1) sound quality; (2) battery life; (3) carrying/charging case; (4) quality of mic/call quality; (5) Fitment/Use Type and Controls; (6) connectivity; (7) noise cancelation<br/><br/>Verdict for why the m3s might be good/bad for you in terms of sound quality:<br/><br/>Sound Quality (why it might be good for you):<br/><br/>If you want clear, accurate, smooth, and rich sound, then the m3s are for you; if you mainly listen to music such as jazz, classical, pop, rock, instrumental, podcast, and vocal-intensive tracks that are instrumentally and vocally heavy, then the m3s are for you. The m3s thrive in this kind of musical/sound spectrum.<br/><br/>Sound Quality (why it might be bad for you):<br/><br/>If you’re into bass and/or mainly listen to bass heavy music, then the m3s are not for you (why – because although the bass is adequate for my taste and the bass is neutral and not overproduced, the bass might not be what you’d like it to be if you like some good bass. If you want superior bass, maybe the Sony WF-1000XM4 and/or Bose QuietComfort might be good for you). The m3s mainly provide clean and organic bass, so if you want more bass, try the Sony or Bose.<br/><br/>Verdict for why the m3s might be good/bad for you in terms of battery life:<br/><br/>Battery Life (why it might be good for you):<br/><br/>With an appropriate sound level, I got approximately 4.5 hours on a single charge. It’s also important to note that it takes about 10 minutes to provide 1 hour of batter life; which is impressive. If you don’t constantly use earbuds on a daily basis and don’t mind charging the carrying case 1-2 times/week, then the m3s might be good for you.<br/><br/>Battery Life (why it might be bad for you):<br/><br/>If you use earbuds on a daily basis and often have them on mid to high volume levels, the m3s might be bad for you. If you’re looking for a TWEs with great battery life, consider other options; here are a few options that have significantly better battery life than the m3s: Edifer TWS1 Pro (10hrs); Master &amp; Dynamic MW08 (9hrs);  Jabra Elite 7 Pro (8hrs); Sony WF-1000XM4 (7.5hrs); Soundcore Liberty 3 Pros (6hrs)<br/><br/>Verdict for why the m3s might be good/bad for you in terms of carrying/charging case:<br/><br/>Carrying/charging case (why it might be good for you):<br/><br/>If you don’t mind a Keurig-sized carrying/charging case, then the m3s might be good for you. Also, the case is able to charge the m3s approximately 3 times from empty to full, and with a 10 minute charge in the case, it provides the m3s with 1 hour of battery life. I'm a bit annoyed with the size of the case; however, it isn't a deal breaker for me; it's more of an eye sore whenever I look at my bulging pocket.<br/><br/>Carrying/charging case (why it might be bad for you):<br/><br/>If you don’t want a case bulging from your pocket, then the m3s are not for you (why – because I believe the case is a bit tall (height) and no angle is going to prevent it from bulging from your pocket). There are several TWEs out there that have a smaller carrying/charging case; to mention a few: Soundcore Liberty 3 Pros (it’s shape like a pebble, so it’s short in height); Jabra Elite 7 Pro (much smaller in terms of width and height). In terms of size, the Soundcore Liberty 3 Pros are my favorite; however, in terms of function, it's probably the worst given the angle it takes needed to put/remove the earbuds from the case.<br/><br/>Verdict for why the m3s might be good/bad for you in terms of quality of mic/call quality:<br/><br/>Quality of Mic/Making phone calls (why it might be good for you):<br/><br/>One thing that many people disregard with TWE is mic quality/call quality. One of the big things I look for when it comes to TWEs is mic quality/call quality (in which how well the other caller can hear me). I drive a lot, so it annoys me when I’m calling my bank or contacting customer service, and the representative can't hear me loud enough and/or clearly as they hear background noise from driving.<br/><br/>If you like being able to be heard clearly and loudly from other callers, the m3s might be good for you. The m3s offers great mic quality, it is able to moderately suppress background noise. Overall, I haven't received too many complaints from other callers. When compared to the Jabra Elite 7 Pros; Sony WF-1000XM4; other several TWEs I’ve used in the past, the m3s beats them in this category by a mile. Even the m2s was mediocre on making phone calls, so the m3s are much improved for making phone calls.<br/><br/>Quality of Mic/Making phone calls (why it might be bad for you):<br/><br/>If you want to be heard even better (more clearly, loudly, and suppress background noise), I found that the Soundcore Liberty 3 Pros is able to do just that. So, if making phone calls is very important for you, the m3s might not be good for you). Similar to my situation with the m2s, the sound quality was there, but the phone quality wasn't there, so I ended up getting and sticking to the Soundcore Liberty 3 Pros (as it both had the sound quality and mic/call quality that I wanted).<br/><br/>Verdict for why the m3s might be good/bad for you in terms of fitment/use type/controls:<br/><br/>Fitment/Use Type and Controls (why it might be good for you):<br/><br/>If you’ll be mainly using the m3s casually, commuting to work, wanting a comfortable fit, then the m3s might be good for you. Fitment wise, the m3s fit great. There are several ear tips to choose from, but the default one was sufficient for me. I would feel confident running in them, but I know the m3s aren’t really intended for that use, so I’d rather use a different TWE for running. Length of wear time is good; I feel that I can have them on for hours without having ear fatigue.<br/><br/>In terms of controls, I found the touch control to be responsive and accurate. As of now, I haven’t had any accidental presses and I always knew what I was pressing since I’m able to customize the touch controls via Sennheiser Smart Control App. The one thing I wish the m3 had regarding touch controls is getting some voice confirmation on what I had activated/deactivated; for example, the Jabra Elite 7 Pros would give me a confirmation on what I had activated/deactivated every time I had touched the button. Aside from the m3s lacking the voice confirmation, the m3s touch control is sufficient for my use.<br/><br/>Fitment/Use Type and Controls (why it might be bad for you):<br/><br/>If you’ll be mainly using the m3s to run/jog/work out, then the m3s are not for you (why – because the m3s are rated IPX4 (water resistant) and although fitment is secure for daily use, fitment is not highly secure for exercising purposes). Since the m3s are rated IPX4, it’s not going to be exactly the best TWE to work out with, especially if you sweat heavily. Also, if absolute fitment is key to you, I suggest probably the most secure TWE with customizable fitment is the Ultimate Ears (UE) Fits; these literally can precisely mold into your ears. Other options to consider might be the Jaybird Vista 2, Beats Powerbeats Pro, Bose Sport Open, and the Anker Soundcore Life Dot 2; all these are better than the m3s in terms of fitment/use type.<br/><br/>Regarding controls, everyone is going to have their preference (touch controls or physical controls?). For me, I prefer physical controls as I like the affirmation and tactile feeling of knowing that I had pressed a button. With touch controls, sometimes you can’t even tell if you had press something intentionally and/or unintentionally; therefore, I prefer physical controls. So, if physical controls are important for you, then the m3s might not be good for you. Consider the Jabra Elite line (e.g., 75t, 85t, 7 pro, etc) if physical controls are important. If you don’t mind the touch control, then the m3s might be good for you. The m3s have much of a better touch control than some of the TWEs out there; to name a few, m2s (not always consistent and wasn’t always accurate), Soundcore Liberty 3 Pros (one of the worst touch controls as they are very sensitive); Sony WF-1000XM4 (touch control was decent and better than the Liberty 3 Pros and m2s, but not better than the m3s). Although physical buttons is my preference, for me, it’s not one of those deal breaker features.<br/><br/>Verdict for why the m3s might be good/bad for you in terms of connectivity:<br/><br/>Connectivity (why it might be good for you):<br/><br/>The m3s have Bluetooth 5.2, aptX Adaptive, aptX, AAC, and SBC. These are all great connectivity features, only if you have devices that support these; if not, then it won't matter; although having it is better than not having it. Since the m3s support 5.2, this means Bluetooth range is great and pairs much faster to devices than TWEs that are on 5.0 or 5.1 Bluetooth. For these reasons, the m3 might be good for you.<br/><br/>Connectivity (why it might be bad for you):<br/><br/>The m3s might not be a good for you if multi-point is an important feature for you, which if you don't know, multi-point allows the connection of two devices. So, this might be a deal breaker for some people; however, multi-point can be added in the future with a firmware/software update.<br/><br/>Verdict for why the m3s might be good/bad for you in terms of noise cancelation:<br/><br/>Noise cancelation and Transparency mode (why it might be good for you):<br/><br/>If you’ll be using the m3s while commuting and while at the office, then the m3s might be good for you. The noise cancelling on the m3s are great (8 out of 10). Even without having adaptive noise cancelation on (passive isolation), the passive isolation is impressive and sometimes is sufficient where I just disable the adaptive noise cancelation to save battery. So, when you don't have active noise cancelling turned on, it still feels like it's on because passive isolation really blocks out background noise well. The m3s also don’t have that cabin pressure effect that the Sony WF-1000XMF have.  Since I commute a lot, I can say that I can comfortable have the windows mid-way half down and still be able to listen to music without any interruptions from the wind noise; one of the great features of the m3s is being able to customize your settings through the Smart Control App; there's a feature in which is primary intended to block wind noise.<br/><br/>Regarding transparency, if you want detailed and close to natural sound as if you aren’t wearing earbuds, then the m3s might be good for you.<br/><br/>Noise cancelation and Transparency mode (why it might be bad for you):<br/><br/>If you’ll be using the m3s in very noisy environments (e.g., stadium/arena full of people, busy malls, busy call centers, outside construction, and/or anything with that nature), then the m3s might not be good for you (why – because although the m3s have great passive noise isolation and great active noise cancelation, however, it is not superior in the noise cancelation category. If you want superior noise cancelation, maybe the Sony WF-1000XM4 and/or Bose QuietComfort might be good for you; the Sony’s or Bose will be more sufficient to block out most if not all background noise of a stadium/arena full of people.<br/><br/>Regarding transparency mode, to put it simply, if you have transparency mode turned on with the m3s, the outside will sound very detailed; so if you don’t like that, then the m3s might not be good for you.<br/><br/>Overall comparison between the m2s and m3s:<br/>-Loudness drastically improved from the m2s; even at max level volume, the m2s didn’t seem that loud; however, with the m3s, it gets very loud and have yet to reach max level volume (wouldn’t want to do that anyway).<br/><br/>-Nose cancelling have drastically improved from the m2s. The nose cancelling from the m2s is a bit of a joke as it feels that it only reduces background noise by approx. 5-10%. However, with the m3s, background noise reduced approx 80%; this is a big jump from the m2s.<br/><br/>-Mic/call quality significantly improved from the m2s. I really wanted to keep the m2s at the time because of the sound quality, but settled for the Soundcore Liberty Pro 3 because the mic quality on that thing is one of the best in the industry. So, now that I’ve been using the m3s and have noticed a significant improvement form the m2s, I’ll be selling my Soundcore Liberty Pro 3 and keep the m3s.<br/><br/>-Touch controls have significantly improved from the m2s and are less sensitive, yet naturally responsive. The m2’s touch controls were a bit finicky and didn’t seem well-developed; however, the m3’s touch controls are accurate, responsive, and well-developed.<br/><br/>-Sound quality considerably improved from the m2s. Although the m2s sound quality were already great to begin with, the m3s appears more articulate and detailed, thus sound quality is excellent as opposed to the m2s.<br/><br/>-The design has considerably improved; the m3s appears sleeker and no longer have the shiny aluminum finish (my personal preference) from the m2s. The m3s are also smaller and weighs less than the m2s.<br/><br/>-The m3s are cheaper than the m2s when they were first introduced (however, the m2s are now cheaper due to the availability of the m3s).<br/>One of the reasons why I returned the m2s were because the call quality and/or mic quality was mediocre; this is why I ended up getting the Soundcore Liberty Pro 3s because the mic quality in addition to the sound quality was excellent.<br/><br/>My overall take:<br/><br/>I've tried many true wireless earbuds, endlessly searching for the right ones. To name a few: Sennheiser Momentum 2 (currently $199), Jabra Elite 7 Pro (currently $199); Jabra Elite 85t (currently $229); Jabra Elite 75t (currently $215); Anker Soundcore Liberty 3 Pro (currently $129); Master &amp; Dynamic MW08 (currently $299); Bose QuietComfort (currently $279); Sony WF-1000XM4; Apple AirPods Pro; Klipsche T5 II McLaren Edition; Bowers &amp; Wilkins PI7 (currently $400); Grado GT220 (currently $259); Bang &amp; Olufsen Beoplay EQ (currently $399).<br/><br/>Based on my numerous attempts from trying my numerous TWEs, I hope you can tell that I like quality sound and although I won’t consider myself an audiophile, I can differentiate between quality sound and poor sound. Originally, I ended up with the Soundcore Liberty 3 Pros. The sound quality is amazing, almost just as good as the m2 and m3s; however, where the Liberty Pros lacked was with its weak noise cancelling, awkwardly having to put and take out the earbuds from its case; fitment wasn't always great; touch controls were overly sensitive. After a few weeks and usage of the m3s, I can say that the m3s are one of the best TWEs that I've tried. I've been wanting to replace the Soundcore Liberty 3 Pros for awhile now due to the annoyances that I've mentioned earlier, and the m3s have taken my spot in terms of best overall TWEs (for my use and preferences).<br/><br/>I plan on trying the Technics EAH-AZ60-K ($229) to see if it can beat the m3s. I'll update my review once I receive it. If not, I plan on keeping the m3s for awhile. For now, I'm happy with the m3s. I plan of updating my review to 5 stars if the m3s is still able to beat the Technics. Likewise, if I have start having problems with the m3s, I’ll adjust my review accordingly.<br/><br/>Updated Review: June 02, 2022:<br/>Here’s an update (and why I’ve decided to keep the M3s):<br/><br/>As mentioned earlier from my initial review, I would only give the M3s 5 stars if it held up to the Technics AZ60s.<br/><br/>So here’s the update:<br/><br/>*Call quality is very important to me; that’s why I previously had the Soundcore Liberty 3 Pros (L3P) as I believe it’s the best true wireless earbuds (TWE) for both audio quality and phone/mic quality. However, I ended up getting rid of the L3P due to several reasons (e.g., ANC was mediocre, connectivity issues, odd fitment, touch control sensitivity issues, and a finicky case). For these reasons, I decided to give up the L3P and try out the M3s. So, after trying out the M3s, I decided to try and compare it to the Technics AZ60. So here’s my take between the M3s and the AZ60:<br/><br/>*Both have very good mic quality, but I thought the Technics AZ60 had better a better mic quality; however, it only shines in environments with minimal background noise. In contrast, the M3s seem to do a better job overall in call quality/mic use in both noisy environments as background noise is less noticeable than with the AZ60s. As soon as there is heavy background noise, the AZ60s voice clarity and quality start to deteriorate.<br/><br/>*The max volume level on the M3s is one of the loudest (I have yet to have it on max volume as I wouldn’t want to) from the other TWEs I've tried in the past. In contrast, the AZ60s don't get to a level high enough where it would hurt my ears if volume maxed out (a similar issue with the L3P).<br/><br/>Verdict:<br/>I've decided to bump up my review to 5 stars as I believe the M3s were able to hold off the AZ60s. Although, here's why I WOULD have kept the AZ60s:<br/><br/>*The AZ60s case is almost less than half the size of the m3s. This is not too much of a big deal for me, but it just annoys me to see the M3s case bulge out in my pocket. Although the case quality is much better on the M3s, I don’t mind the case quality of the AZ60s as it is fairly a straight forward case, that’s small and light weight, which I prefer.<br/><br/>*The sound quality on the AZ60s is slightly better the the M3s  in terms of clarity and richness; although bass is a bit more prominent on the AZ60s than the M3s.<br/><br/>*The AZ60’s provide voice feedback/confirmation whenever pressing/tapping the touch control (e.g., “noise cancelling on,” “transparency on,” etc.); whereas the M3s offer no kind of confirmation after tapping/pressing the earbuds.<br/><br/>*Noise cancelling on the AZ60s are somewhat identical to the M3s; however, I believe the AZ60s is slightly better, with about a 2% edge over the M3s.<br/><br/>Here's why I DECIDED to keep the M3s:<br/><br/>*Phone/Mic quality is probably the most important factor for me when it comes to TWEs; secondly, it would be the sound quality. I could not fathom why there are a lot of reviews out there praising the call quality from the AZ60s. Yes, the call quality is great, but ONLY in quiet environments. Overall, it does a terrible job, as I mentioned earlier, on being able to suppress the background noise from my end to the other caller. I've done multiple tests to test the call/mic quality by leaving myself voicemails in different environments (e.g., driving with the window up/down; walking in a busy street; being near a large crowd, etc), and I found that it doesn't make any sense to have a high quality mic, when voice gets distorted from the background noise. I only found the call quality from the AZ60s to be great in quiet environments. However, the M3s did a great job on suppressing background noise from my end to the other caller.<br/><br/>Due to the reason above and reasons mentioned prior to this update, I’ve decided to keep the M3s and return the AZ60s.<br/><br/>Hope this helps.</span>

<span>Went through several earbuds. Sony WF 1000, jabra 85t ,Samsung buds pro.  I have been using Soundcore life 2 for over a year. They are great buds but was looking for an upgrade.<br/><br/>The jabra's sounded great and the anc was amazing. I can shoot all my guns using these as earplugs they block everything. The battery life is short they are big and don't fit well and you can only use the right one independently which was the biggest reason I returned them.<br/><br/>The Samsung pros sounded better then the soundcore I had been using but they were factory broke and I didn't want to mess with getting another set and returning for a full refund later so I just got a full refund. So I didn't get to test these much.<br/><br/>The Sony WF 1000 were the biggest joke on people and I am convinced Sony paid off every rating company to place them in the number one spot. They didn't sound as good as my 60 dollar Soundcore earbuds and the call quality was weird according to my wife. I messed with every setting I could find and spent over 12 hours on the phone before returning them. Extremely disappointed in these earbuds for over a 300 dollar price tag. ANC means nothing if they sound like shit.<br/><br/>Never heard of sennheiser but upon watching several YouTube earbud reviews because reading reviews online had been a failure. I decided to try these next.<br/><br/>I am blown away they are everything you can want in one perfectly fitting comfortable light package.<br/><br/>I work 12 hour shifts on a drilling rig with loud machinery. I use these as ear protection/ phone calls/ music. They last forever they haven't died on me yet more then 6 hours. They sound amazing, better then any of the others I tried. They block the loud noise of my work enviroment. The call quality is excellent. They are light and very comfortable.<br/><br/>I can't recommend these highly enough.</span>

<span>I own 8 different pairs of headphones, including many hi-fi pairs like the Sennheiser IE900, Denon AH--D9200 and Fostex TH900.  These TW3s I use more for casual listening, working out, doing stuff around the house, gaming, etc.<br/><br/>These are by far my favorite pair of bluetooth buds in this price range - FAR and away better than the AirPods Pro (which I also own).  This should not be surprising, as Sennheiser has been in the sound game for quite a while, and they use similar drivers across their consumer and pro lines, though of course with different tuning and housing components. The result is still something better than most other alternatives.  Brief breakdown.<br/><br/>Tonal performance:  These perform extremely well at all volumes.  Oftentimes, you will find that certain parts of the mix are out of balance when the headphones are too high or too low - not the case here.  Whether you want to have quiet background music or crank it up and have a personal dance party, these hold their own well.  They also do not distort at volume.  In terms of tuning, straight out of the box, these are definitely V-shaped - meaning, the bass is boosted, the treble is boosted, and the mids sit back in the mix.  This is often described as a "fun" tune, and it is well done here.  It works well for mainstream music.  If you want to tweak this, the fact that you can use the app to do some basic EQing is nice, and they do respond pretty well to EQ.<br/><br/>Bass is very well-done.  It has a lot of volume and depth, though out of the box, it is very smooth and controlled and not overly boomy.  However, if you like the boom, there is a bass boost option in the app that certainly delivers.  I'm a basshead myself, and I found the bass boost too much even for me.  If you love bass, these can deliver for sure.<br/><br/>Mids here are also silky smooth.  I have always found Sennheiser's vocal presentation to be among the best, and that holds with these.  These also do a good job of keeping all of the pieces of the mix separate.  It's not hi-fi level, but is among the best for this class of product.<br/><br/>Highs are also great.  These have the best detail retrieval of any earphone I've used in this price range, though the tuning isn't the only reason for that (will get to it in a second).  The highs also make themselves known without crushing your ears.  I haven't found fatigue to be an issue.<br/><br/>Where these really shine is the soundstage and positioning.  While the soundstage itself isn't particularly large, it's VERY good size for this price range (way bigger than the AirPods), and the positioning of the pieces of the mix within that soundstage is outstanding.  The sound here will definitely have an "in your head" type feel, with the sound extending from ear to ear.  It does not have a ton of height or depth, but it does have some - but more importantly, the positioning within that soundstage is very, very good.  Often with buds, things will be kind of jumbled - left, right, center.  Not so with these.  The stage is used very well and is very full and natural.<br/><br/>All of these things combine to make an overall sound that is warm and smooth.  It is distinctly Sennheiser.  As mentioned earlier, I own their flagship in-ear monitor, the IE900, and while these are certainly not that (and shouldn't be since the IE 900s are 6X the price), they do retain that unique Sennheiser timbre, warmth and soundstage, to an extent, and that's a very good thing.<br/><br/>Now onto the other aspects.  Important to note here, I am an Apple ecosystem person - iPhone, iPad, Mac, ATVs, etc.  I now only use my AirPods Pro for podcast listening OR when it is really important for me to have the convenience of AirPods like hands-free hey Siri and message dictation.  Some reasons why...<br/><br/>Comfort - for me, far better than the AirPods.  Sennheiser includes way more tips, both with and without wings.  My AirPods constantly have to be readjusted, to the point that I can't actually work out in them.  I wouldn't call this Apple's fault, as everyone's ears are different, but the fact that Sennheiser includes more types of tips means you are more likely to find a fit that is great for you.  This was the case for me, as the ability to add wings really helped them stay in my ear, and now these are my primary workout headphones (and they are water resistant as well).<br/><br/>Touch controls - very good.  The fact that they are customizable is great.  The touch is very responsive, and although you may sometimes accidentally tap them when putting them on, it's not a big issue.<br/><br/>Battery life is as advertised.  More than good enough.<br/><br/>Supported codecs are also great.  For example, these support aptX Adaptive, which for the first time has allowed me to use bluetooth earbuds with my Nintendo Switch with no lag.<br/><br/>Noise cancelation is MUCH improved since version 2.  I would say the ANC is on par with the AirPods.  The transparency is ALMOST as good.  I wear them often in transparency mode with no music playing, and it's not a problem.  Everything sounds 9/10.  Where the AirPods beat them is sounding a little more natural with its transparency implementation.  It's clear that the Sennheiser's are processing the sound.<br/><br/>The app is easy to use and intuitive, but where I will knock Sennheiser slightly is on bugs.  I did have a few bugs in the first couple of weeks of owning these - connecting to the app, disconnects occasionally and things like that.  They have since worked this out via updates, but it was annoying at first.  Also, you can only connect to one device at a time, which can be a minor inconvenience.  Rumor has it they are adding multipoint functionality in a software update soon.<br/><br/>Overall, love these and recommend!</span>

<span>I had some Klipsch ear pods I had to return. Sure they had the metal case and metallic earbuds and all those sizes earbud tips but internal quality was bad a constant buzzing sound from a bad chip so I ordered a second pair still bad so returned both of them. I started think what headphones do I she that just simply worked no gimmicks no flash just pure bonafide Hi-Fi then j realized Sennheiser  of course. When I bought these they had just come out no Amazon reviews but I took the chance cause I love my HD-25s and I haven’t looked back. I’m an engineer a job that requires focus by my office is smack dab in the middle of a factory floor full of loud noise forklifts , bulldozers firing up for test, people grinding metal , all of that on top of the normal office chatter and these headphones cut right through that while I work at my desk and get work done.<br/><br/>Now yes these are 100% plastic but they don’t feel cheap and that plastic also means they don’t feel cold touching your skin<br/><br/>Yes they use standard ear bud tips which I was apprehensive about cause I’ve had issue with those falling off or coming off in my ear but these are designed with an aggressive ridge to keep the tips attached to the headphone.<br/><br/>No wireless charging but who cares it’s USB-C just plug it in at night and go about your day they last all my work day<br/><br/>And the sound is probably as good as it gets from reasonably priced Bluetooth earbuds so yeah no bass boomy but that’s inherent in the form factor bass requires big drivers and lots of power which kills your battery life and adds weight.<br/><br/>Could you get better sound sure but why it’s Bluetooth off your phone into tiny battery powered earbuds so your quality is limited already so this is probably that sweet spot where diminishing marginal returns kicks in where you have to spend way more money or buy big Bluetooth headphones to get better sound<br/><br/>If you buy these as earbuds for work or travel where portability and battery life trumps fidelity then you’ll love these if you expect fidelity similar to much pricier wired headphones you’ll be disappointed but only because your expectations were unrealistic.0</span>

<span>Sound quality is amazing for earbuds, that is expected out of Sennheiser. Able to hear the crispness, the depths and details of the audio and have a great bass for its size.  The volume is not too shabby too. The battery is good and last quite a while until you need to recharge. And the case packs extra juice when you're on-the-go. Taking calls is fantastic. The transition between listening to audio and taking calls along with the extra support from the 'Sidetone' feature it has. Noise isolation is good. The ANC is not the best, but decent.<br/><br/>The earbuds themselves are pretty big but I like it. It's pretty noticeable when you wear but at least it is somewhat okay in style. The case doesn't have any holes to put accessories on or to tie to your bag. It is a bit on the bulky side of the size spectrum, so leaving it in the pocket is going to be a bit uncomfortable.<br/><br/>The volume is a bit confusing. The volume control you have on the earbuds is only for the earbuds. You may have max volume on your device but if you have min volume on your earbuds, you can't hear anything. I didn't realize this at first and thought something was wrong with the earbuds when the audio didn't come through. Checked my device and the audio level is high, only to realize the earbud volume is min, so I had to change directly using the touch control. A bit finnicky if only using one earbud as you also have to put the other bud to change the opposite level (increase/decrease).<br/><br/>The accompanying app could use a lot of improvements. Need better equalizer instead of just the three bars. Let users share their EQ creations and try other EQ presets from others. No earbuds volume control on the app, all need to be through the touch control. When you open the app, it takes a while for the app to 'connect' to your earbuds and let you access the controls on the app. It doesn't take long to 'connect' each time but still noticeable. This is weird as it's already connected by bluetooth, shouldn't it be seamless.<br/><br/>Overall, good product. Very good hardware and amazing sound quality with rooms for improvements especially the app.</span>

<span>I really enjoyed these headphones while they lasted. They had great sound quality. I received no complaints about call quality when I used them for personal and business calls. The noise cancellation was superb to any others that I had owned. The active listening was clear and allowed you to listen to the person you were talking to while also keeping the jams going and they paired effortlessly between devices.<br/><br/>Unfortunately I lost one. I've contacted Sennheiser for a replacement earbud and haven't received an email or call back. I'm sure the loss of the earbud won't be covered under warranty, but I wasn't really expecting it to be. I'm just hoping I can buy a replacement bud instead of having to buy a new set.<br/><br/>I'd definitely recommend them to a friend, family member or colleague for the quality of product. Time will tell if I'd recommend them for their customer support.</span>

<span>These were fine, but not great. The noise canceling is not great, wouldn't even cover basic sounds like my refrigerator, so I was disappointed. The tap controls were fine. One annoying thing: if you take them out of your ears, they don't disconnect from Bluetooth or turn off, leading to some awkward situations in phone calls. Overall I expected more from this brand and price.</span>

<span>I never write reviews so you know this has to be good!<br/><br/>2 weeks ago I was at the gym walking on the treadmill and my hand caught the wire to my headphones and my phone and headphones fell on the treadmill and flew off the back. A few people witnessed and I thought to myself "it's finally time to get wireless earbuds".<br/><br/>I spent countless days researching which earbuds to get and it was super overwhelming. But I narrowed priorities down to best sound quality and ANC.<br/><br/>I went with these earbuds because I have over the ear headphones by Sennheiser and they are tremendous. So I expected great sound quality with these buds and that's exactly what I got! Right out of the box these sound amazing. I recommend the neutral preset or the dance preset.<br/><br/>After realizing the sound quality was amazing and just what I expected from Sennheiser, it was time to try the gym. Walking on the treadmill with these earbuds I was blown away by the ANC!!! I have seen some reviews say its good and some say its bad... I reassure you its very good! ANC was a huge factor into buying earbuds for me because I have mild hearing loss from my time in the military. This ANC is so good now I do not need to turn my headphones up to drown out the outside noise and ultimately not damaging my hearing!<br/><br/>Walking on the treadmill in a busy gym, I put the earbuds into transparency mode and then you can really see just how much sound around you is being taken away by the amazing ANC. (yes I know transparency mode magnifies the sounds around you but you still get a good idea of how many sounds there are).<br/><br/>Even though these earbuds are kind of big, they are surprisingly light weight. the touch controls work great. I tried on multiple ear-tips that came with them and realized the standard medium size that came default was the best choice for me.<br/><br/>The only downside which could be a killer for some... these are not extremely comfortable (sometimes).<br/>These things are big, but stay in my ear way better than I anticipated.. yet on the treadmill I found myself trying to readjust my right earbud after 30 mins of use. My left earbud felt perfect! it was in the right position and felt almost weightless in my ear and had a great fit/cover into my ear. I kept messing with my right earbud to try to get it the same until I just decided to take it out and continue walking without it. My left earbud kept playing music perfectly and that's a great feature to have if you don't want to use both. After 5 mins without my right ear bud, I put it back in and it felt great, just like my left ear felt and I finished my hour walk and was having a blast. I lost track of time and almost was late to get home and get ready for work I was just enjoying these ear buds so much, messing around with the EQ settings and switching genres of music.<br/><br/>I think because I am not an avid ear bud user, my ears are still getting used to them and might get better wearing them for longer periods of time. But honestly all ear buds might feel this way for me.<br/><br/>So that's the review, Sennheiser is a golden brand! These earbuds have AMAZING sound quality. They sound great out of the box and have a great sound stage for ear buds. I have had a blast with them. The only down side is comfortability with long use, which honestly, I don't think I would enjoy wearing any ear buds for a long period. I also go these ear buds for $130 on sale... for that price... it's a steal!<br/><br/>You can never go wrong with Sennheiser sound!</span>

<span>I have used Sennheiser RS180 headphones for watching TV for five years.. Although they are still good as new, after a week of research I thought I would try upgrading to the RS 195 to take advantage of the hearing-assist and different sound modes. As a result of my research and trial, I learned several things about my relationship with headphones for use with the TV.<br/><br/> CLOSED AIR: Over the ear closed-end headphones are too isolating for me --- Even though these are not noise-cancelling, I can't hear the doorbell, the phone, or my wife, even when there is no signal.  Endangering my marriage is a deal killer. Not to mention safety issues when I am home alone watching TV.  Any replacement over the ear headphones must be open-air, like my 180s.<br/><br/>SPEECH ENHANCING MODE: This depresses music and ambient sounds in favor of dialogue.  It works.  Dialogue is in fact much clearer which could be an important feature for the hearing impaired who don't like to use closed captions.  But the signal appears to drop the stereo effect.  The voices sound like they are coming from the center of your head – in effect, a monaural signal. The music track, although softer, can still be heard, but it is unnatural and distorted.  If I can hear music, I prefer it to sound natural. The result is annoying.<br/><br/>SOUND MODES: These appear to me to be nothing more than simple treble or bass boosts.  That may be useful to some, but for me, the default selection is balanced enough.<br/><br/>VOLUME LIMIT: I thought the volume limit described in several reviews here would not be a problem for me, because I use a powerful receiver as my sound source rather than a TV.  Much to my surprise, I could not boost the volume above a certain level, no matter how high I turned up the volume on the receiver.  Perhaps this is due to an automatic volume control on the headphones, a feature ostensibly designed to protect hearing. If so perhaps there is a way to disable it.  But I found it curious that on a set specifically designed for hearing impaired there was a problem with getting the volume beyond a certain (arbitrary?) level.  It was loud enough for me, but it might not be for some.<br/><br/>BOTTOM LINE: Primarily because of the closed end feature, I returned the195s. I will stay with my 180s for now. When it’s time to replace them, I might move up to the 185s, which are open-air and probably similar to the 180s.</span>

<span>Perfect sound out of the box.  Overall sound is extremely full.<br/>I can walk all around my house and not have static or loss of signal.<br/>The top dial can optionally steer the onboard EQ more bass-heavy or treble-heavy.<br/>The mode button increases vocal clarity for TV shows or Music for an even more full sound if you want to disregard the musicians mastering (Music is obviously the listener's taste afterall)<br/>Very little latency - I performed a latency test and couldn't tell the difference vs wired headphones.<br/><br/>Only two cons for me are the earpads and price.  I had to replace the pads with velour, the original ones made me very hot within a few minutes.  As for the price... you get what you pay for I suppose.<br/><br/>Thank you Sennheiser! You made a wonderful product!</span>

<span>i have had this headphone rig for a few weeks now and my first impressions are that if you are struggling with the onset of hearing difficulties this product may not be what you are looking for.<br/><br/> in my situation i have the rs195 dac/transmitter/processor/charger connected via optical cable to a lg smart flat panel tv. at start up you have to make sure that the tv's audio output is set to PCM, i did this setup procedure and followed the headphone manual in regard to preparing the headphones for use. all steps completed, tv and headphones on and i was hearing a very weak output from the headset with the volume on the headset at max output. i tried several different combinations of processing, tried increasing the tv's volume and nothing i tried seemed to increase the headphone output to the point that i could easily hear the tv sound. i checked the package the headphones came in and sure enough the box stated that the output of the headphones is 117db.<br/><br/> speaking from experience 117db should have been far louder than what i was hearing. so i took out my realistic model 33-2050 sound pressure meter to measure what the actual max sound pressure was. the meter was used on the "C" weighted flat scale, with the meters microphone place next to the headphone drivers output the meter read between 55db to 60db, changing processing on the base did not yield any measurable improvement.<br/><br/>also noticed was that the sound continually dropped out on the headphones for a second or two while the tv speakers continued to play uninterrupted. this sound interruption on the headphone was very annoying. i gave up at that point thinking that some of the poor reviews i read were true.<br/><br/>a few days later i tried again, when i put the headphone on i was disappointed again, they just were not loud enough especially since they are advertised for people with hearing loss. as i was listening i tried pressing the ear cups tighter to my head to see if that helped, while i was doing that all of a sudden the volume increased noticeably. i released the pressure on the ear cups and the volume stayed at the increased level. i looked at the processor/charger/base and noticed all leds with regard to signal processing were off. i then realized what i had done when holding the headset tight to my ears was turn off all signal processing. without this processing the volume jumps up to a reasonable level for someone that has hearing loss. it could be louder and is not at 117db, but it was much better. the headphone sound interruption was still present and annoying as heck.<br/><br/>a few days latter i thought perhaps a source other than tv might have a effect on the sound interruptions i was experiencing. there was a dvd player connected to the tv so rather than use a tv station terrestrial signal as source i used the dvd player as the source. big improvement, no more interruption in headphone sound. my best guess is that slight interruptions in tv rf signals are compensated in the tv's internal sound output to its speakers but not to its optical output. since there are no interruptions in input signal with the dvd player the sound out of the headphones is not interrupted.<br/><br/>so if you are at the onset of hearing loss and looking for a headset that you can play as loud as you want while your significant other turns down the tv's volume level in the room because of their sensitive hearing this may not be the headphones for you. if you decide to try them you may find by defeating the signal processing brings the volume to a more reasonable level.</span>
