<span>I'm not an acer fan, as acer was like the hyundai's of the pc tech world in my book, but I needed a laptop for my daughter and this one fit the bill.<br/><br/>So far so good, I'd say build quality is fairly decent, it's slimmer than I expected. Performance wise, obviously it's no beast, but it gets the job done. What's really great about this is the fact that the ram is upgradeable to 64GB, but I'll just purchase an 8GB stick to add to it.<br/><br/>There is room for a 2.5" SSD. The NVME is also removeable, so while there's no sd card slot, storage is fully expandable in a better way.<br/><br/>Having a backlit keyboard with #pad is excellent.<br/><br/>Webcam quality is ok, nothing to talk about there, 720p 30fps max, but as mentioned before, gets the job done.<br/><br/>Even with only 4Gb Ram, it still ran smoothly despite having several Chrome windows open with multiple tabs. Installed minecraft java edition for her, it was able to play set at 7 chunks render distance, and not very many settings dialed down and still get 60fps (not that she cared about fps), so I still think you may be able to play some titles at 720p maybe medium settings, but i haven't checked it yet.<br/><br/>Screen is not bad, viewing angles are quite good and bright enough.<br/><br/>The speaker are not loud but audio quality is fairly decent, especially given how slim the laptop is. Your phone may go louder, but it won't scrape your ear canal.<br/><br/>Battery life is average I'd say.<br/><br/>All in all, this is a laptop that is more expensive than it should be, AS ARE ALL THAT FALL IN THIS PRICE POINT, but definitely compared against all the others I've sifted through, it's the best. In summary, it is because:<br/><br/>1. Ability to upgrade internal nvme storage + add 2.5" ssd<br/><br/>2. As with internal storage, ram isn't soldered on like the other brand laptops and can be upgraded<br/><br/>3. Latest WiFi and Bluetooth technology<br/><br/>4. Backlit keyboard with number pad and fingerprint scanner on touchpad<br/><br/>5. Inclusion of an ethernet port. Especially helpful if you need a stable internet connection.<br/><br/>6. Windows 11 ready<br/><br/>7. Decent display with good viewing angles<br/><br/>8. Decent quad core apu<br/><br/>9. USB-C also available on chassis and overall, decent I/O<br/><br/>It's a solid buy if you're looking for a laptop within it's price range at the time of this review. It offers the most features and flexibility vs the competition.</span>

<span>No one feature is exceptional, but the amount of features/quality at the sub-400 price is impressive.<br/><br/>❧ Solid construction, aluminum lid<br/>❧ Modern (at time of purchase) and moderately-well-equipped Ryzen APU<br/>❧ IPS screen with good max and min brightness, even backlight, and acceptable color rendition<br/>❧ Backlit Keyboard with a great layout and good key quality<br/>❧ Large, responsive trackpad with a turn-off option in the function keys<br/>❧ Good cooling solution for the size<br/>❧ User accessible / upgradable parts<br/>❧ Acceptable I/O (USB, HDMI, LAN, headphone jack, kensington)<br/><br/>Corners that were cut:<br/><br/>❧ Storage size - 128gb DRAM-less SSD as configured<br/>❧ Win 10 in S mode (I believe Microsoft charges less for the "s" license)<br/>❧ Speakers are truly terrible. I cannot overemphasize how bad they are.<br/>❧ Ram Size - 4gb DDR4 2400<br/>❧ No card reader<br/>❧ 1 year warranty (remember when things actually had 2 or 3???)<br/>❧ No Mic jack<br/><br/>The storage is upgradeable. The included SSD is user-replaceable, and there is also an included space /  hardware to add a 2.5" drive. The 4gb RAM is built in to the board, but there is one slot open for RAM. Having filled mine, CPU-Z reports that it is successfully running in dual channel mode (important for APU memory bandwidth).<br/><br/>It strikes me that the corners cut are ALL user-addressable. Windows 10 can leave S mode. Ram/storage is upgradeable. Card readers and external speakers/headphones/audio interfaces can be used.<br/><br/>The 3350u processor has a manufacturer-configurable TDP, which affects its boost clock behavior. This one seems to be configured to a relatively medium-low power. I have never seen it boost past 3.1ghz (the AMD spec sheet lists a 3.5 ghz max). Fine by me, but worth noting. The cooling solution seems like it could handle more, but it does dump heat primarily beneath it (i.e. into your lap if you are using it as a laptop literally). I don't really blame them for dialing it back for this reason or to hit battery life targets.<br/><br/>After adding RAM and storage, I have successfully done some medium gaming at low settings. Civ 6, Life is Strange 2, and the infamously-processor-bound-poorly-optimized Guild Wars 2. All fine, but I would have gotten something more powerful if I didn't have a gaming desktop.<br/><br/>My last laptop was from 2009 and lasted me 'til 2021. The hardware on this one should meet my needs for equally long -- all that's left to be seen is if anything randomly breaks between now and then. If any random breakage occurs between now and 2023 I will update this review.</span>

<span>First this seems to be a very good value for the money but you should know before buying, a few things.  I personally prefer AMD Ryzen based computing mainly because the computers based on AMD tend to be the best value for your money. Usually these are equal to or slightly lower performing than their Intel counterparts, save for the integrated AMD Vega video controller which is superior to Intel's in a number of important ways.  My biggest issue with this Notebook (distinction is such portable devices that breathe from the underside are NoteBooks whereas MacBooks, as example, are true laptops because of the solid underside which can be set on the lap, carpet, bedding etc) is that this model has, integrated into the motherboard 4GB of DDR4. To have more memory (wise) you will need to purchase a single DDR4 SODIMM of 4, 8 or 16GB thus making the memory bus un-matched which always results in a slight loss in overall performance since the system has to compromise a little to make the miss-matched memory work OR worse has to hobble the system to be on a Single Channel memory bus, resulting often in a 25% loss in total system wide performance. Secondly, while it VERY positive to have a NVMe M.2 SSD in ANY computer system, these come in many flavors. The SK Hynix M.2 SSD this system comes with is considered to be reliable but is also a bit slow at around 500MBps max transfer rate whereas a nice, not very expensive AData XPG NVMe M.2 SSD can peak in a model like this around 2600MBps!  Keep in mind, at this price and for basic use this still seems perfectly OK and still a decent value at around $350 - beyond that price it starts becoming a Not so great value however.  The 1080p IPS screen is not too bad either, considering the price. Finally, this is the first system I've seen that is entirely, irretrievably UEFI which means you will be VERY limited to ONLY those OS' that fully support this. Outside of the fact that Windows 10 "S" is barely usable, a late version of Windows 10 (there've been what, about 12 versions of Win10 up till this point?) or now Windows 11, also the late model Ubuntu family 20.04 LTS and newer as just one example. I tested Win10 Pro and Kubuntu 20.04 LTS on this model and both functioned well though Win10 really Needs a minimum of 16GB to really work well, Kubuntu, on the other hand seemed happy as could be with only 4GB! Nevermind that you can NOT run any Windows programs nearly at all though Linux versions of Firefox, Chrome &amp; Brave all work quite well as does LibreOffice and ONLYOffice... Bottomline here is that there is Nothing wrong with this Notebook, not really - sort of depends on your purpose, values and usage patterns as to whether it will work well for you or not, this is just my rating of this unit... FYI</span>

<span>I bought this laptop after my old one died on me. In the beginning, this was a great replacement laptop and since I had so much of my files in cloud storage, it was very easy to restore and download them to this new laptop. I was back up and running fairly quickly. However, this past week (Week of September 6, 2022) I've had issues where after shutting down the laptop, it wouldn't come on after pressing the power button(power adapter was plugged in). Or the power light on the side of the laptop was blinking after putting it in sleep mode and then it won't "wake back up" after tapping the mouse or quick pressing the power button. I end up having to do a hard shut-down by holding the power button until it turns off. Then after a few seconds press it again to turn it back on and then it'll start up.<br/><br/>Ultimately, 6 months in, and I'm already looking for a new laptop. I might just go and get a Chromebook and then get a new desktop computer. HP laptops and I are clearly having a run of bad luck.</span>

<span>I've recently taken up 3D printing and saving files to an SD card on my 8 yr old laptop with a broken screen was a pain. I like this lil laptop. It's been pretty easy to use. I did take it back to the windows 10 because thats what I'm used to using and so much easier to use and navigate. I use this Asus laptop for my 3D model searching, slicing 3D model's in several apps, I was able to connect it to 1 of my 3D printers and successfully printed model's, I've used it for my Cricut machine with design space. I've used it to watch Amazon prime, Netflix, and YouTube videos (I do have to connect a Bluetooth speaker). I've done file transfers from my phone to the laptop. I would not say this is a gaming laptop, but my son did try it out for a couple of games and liked it. It does not have a touch screen, which is a disappointment. It charges fairly quickly and holds a charge for a long time. 1 issue with the built in number pad in the mouse pad, it keeps turning on and then can't get it to turn off for a while. It's pretty touchy. It is very lightweight and portable. Something a college student could fit into a backpack.</span>

<span>You might think that only 4 gb for a Windows 10 laptop that cant expand the ram is a bad idea... Well, I've found this small laptop is actually fine, even quick for internet browsing, email, word processing and watching videos.  Sure, the keyboard is smaller, but even with large hands, I had no trouble typing...<br/><br/> Obviously, this is not a good choice for gaming or video editing work.  Battery life is very good for the intended basic uses; not Apple Ipad good;  but should give you at least 6+ hours for the basics...<br/><br/> It DOES have a micro SD slot, in addition to the 2 USB ports.<br/><br/>While you can't expand the RAM, you can also expand the storage with an internal NVME stick.<br/><br/>This is a great idea as it noticeably speeds up the computer if you make it the boot drive.  I added a 500GB Samsung 980 NVME stick and am very pleased with the results.<br/><br/>Having read about issues with the Samsung Magician cloning software, and difficulties in making a boot drive change work well on this laptop; let me tell you what worked well for me...<br/><br/>Ordered the Samsung nvme stick, along with a $15 external USB enclosure for this type of chewing gum stick size drive. Downloaded the free version of Easeus Partition Master software to clone the built in Asus L210 drive. Loaded the new stick in the external drive enclosure, connected the drive with a USB cable to a USB slot on the Asus, and followed the directions to clone the Asus C drive.  Opened the Asus and inserted the Samsung stick into the open nvme slot. Pressed power button holding down F2 key to get into bios.<br/><br/>Change the boot order to start with the nvme stick. Save and exit. Booting then detected issues with Windows, so choose to download and install a new, clean copy of Windows 10.  ( If you do this right after you have received the Asus, then you don't have any reason to save data or settings on this Windows clean install.  You don't yet have any personal data to save.)  When Windows is finished with the reinstall, make sure to do your windows updates.<br/><br/>After that is done, use Disk management tool to reformat the original drive,  and resize the partitions on the new nvme drive to what is available.<br/><br/>Now your little, inexpensive laptop is faster, with plenty of drive space.  Certainly one of the better values you can get in a very portable size, great for traveling when you may not want to carry a larger, more expensive laptop.  Screen quality is very good, and the Asus has a full size hdmi out for easy video sharing.  Definitely recommended for the price point and its intended use.</span>

<span>After many years of using actual netbooks, I was in the market for something the same shape and size after they discontinued the term. I wanted something that was somewhat future proof and wouldn't crap out after a few windows updates like all of my previous models.<br/><br/>I saw a video review (it is posted on here and elsewhere) and knew this was the netbook for me. The NVME expansion slot plus the SD card reader made this thing elite compared to other models. I popped a 512GB in here and am able to install old video games, my programs, and even a virtual machine or two.<br/><br/>Windows 10 runs flawlessly on this. Bootup times are a breeze. Program loading times can be a bit slow compared to a much higher end model, but for something as light as this, it is incredible how responsive this little engine that can is.<br/><br/>As everyone will tell you, this thing does not game well. It will play games of yesteryear which is exactly what I bought it for, but of course I tested things like Left4Dead, Tower Unite, and a few others. Left4dead barely runs on here even at lowest settings. Farm Together needs render quality dropped to the bare minimum. I was actually expecting it to run some UT3 engine and Source Engine games at minimal settings, but it failed horribly. I also noticed in the bios, there is not much wiggle room to throw more memory at the GPU and I think that is where is struggles outside of the already known single channel memory flaw. So if you are looking for the casual game of Simcity 2000 or Roller Coast Tycoon, this can handle it, just don't expect to play anything after the 1990s.<br/><br/>I have not made the jump to Windows 11 yet and am a little weary because of the 4GB limitation, but it is constantly reminding me to upgrade so I know that it is fully 11 ready for future proofing.<br/><br/>The numpad seems like a cool idea at first, but I had trouble getting the hang of it and often forget it is even there. I think this is a great feature and may serve a college student who isn't used to traditional trackpads very well. My old self is just so used to a traditional laptop, I need to train myself to utilize it.<br/><br/>I love this netbook and would definitely buy another one if there is an upgraded model in the future when this one starts showing age. I highly recommend it to anyone who wants something small with decent storage and great response times.</span>

<span>THE SCREEN IS REALLY GOOD FOR OUTDOOR WORK AS I FOUND IT TO BE MORE THAN BRIGHT ENOUGH. THE  UP FACING SPEAKERS MAKE IT SOUND LOUDER THAN IT SHOULD.  I AM USING THIS LAPTOP TO WORK REMOTELY AND IT FILLS THE BILL PERFECTLY. IF I HAD 1 DOWNSIDE IT IS THAT THE CPU IS KINDA WEAK FOR MULTI-TASKING IT ONLY USES 6W WHICH IS GREAT FOR BATTERY LIFE, BUT NOT SO GOOD WHEN MULTI-TASKING - FOR EXAMPLE WHEN TRYING TO DO 2 BROWSER WINDOWS AT ONCE (SAY PLAY YOUTUBE IN THE BACKROUND AND SOMETHING ELSE) THE SOUND STUTTERS AND MAY CUT OUT FOR A SEC. WHETHER ITS A MATTER OF RAM OR CPU IT DOESNT MATTER AS YOU CANT CHANGE EITHER. THE 64GB SSD IS THE BARE MINIMUM YOU SHOULD SETTLE FOR AS AFTER WINDOWS THERE IS PROB &lt;20GB LEFT. FOR ME THIS IS A GREAT WORK LAPTOP AND THE PRICE COULD NOT BE BEAT.  YOU COULD EVEN PLAY SOME OLDER GAMES ON LOW SETTTINGS (YOU JUST CAN ONLY INSTALL 1 AT A TIME DUE TO SPACE). I WOULD RECOMMEND THIS LAPTOP.</span>

<span>Bought this for the wife, with the intention of upgrading it. Not a whole lot of information about this model on the internet, but I was curious myself to try out the new Ryzens and Vega chips. It’s does just about everything a normal person would want a computer to do. Getting it out of S mode is literally a flick of a switch. Comes loaded with the normal crapware you expect from an off the shelf computer. It DOES have an unoccupied RAM slot, which I filled with an 8gig stick. What’s curious, is it looks like there’s an empty 2.5 inch bay, which I was going to fill with an SSD, however it doesn’t have SATA cabling or connectors to hook it up. For reference, to get to the main board, you’re going to have to peel off the sticky feet on the underside of the body.<br/>Despite my specific gripes, for $350 it’s an excellent value and looks and feels like what I remember $700 laptops running like five years ago.<br/>In the age of a single USB-C port, having ethernet, USB-C, USB-A, and SD slots is very nice as well.<br/>For an “around town, word and excel, gameboy emulation, The Sims, and YouTube/Netflix/Hulu” machine, it really is exactly what we needed.</span>

<span>Bought this a few months ago after my laptop died. It has great specs and runs really well! Only drawback is the harddrive is tiny. I use OneDrive for everything (with "free up space" used, so nothing is on the harddrive) and only have 30gb of space left, which isn't great for longevity of the drive. I am strongly considering buying a bigger drive to put in it, although not sure if that will void the warranty. And I really wish it had a backlit keyboard. But other than that, this laptop was a steal for the price I got, shipped in 1 day to my house, and completely saved my life because I need a laptop for work &amp; school pretty much 24/7. It also handles games pretty well at medium settings (can only have 1-2 installed at a time; currently have one 15gb game installed and am left with 16gb storage remaining). I don't use the touchscreen a whole lot, but that works really well too. Very precise. I will update this again whenever the laptop stops working, I get a new one, I update the laptop in any way, etc. to report on how it holds up over time. As of right now, I'm still happy with the purchase.</span>

<span>Full disclosure, I am not an IT professional but use laptops, tablets, and desktop computers daily in my personal and work life. This chromebook has far exceeded my expectations. This is my first time using a chromebook. I have had a week or so to really dig into the device. I own an alienware gaming laptop, but I find myself only using it now for gaming purposes only.<br/><br/>This chromebook is fast in my opinion. The speed is snappy and the device responds quickly to gestures and commands. I have yet to find sometime I can't do on this that I do on my windows laptop aside from gaming. One game I like to play requires windows, mac, or linux. Since this has an ARM processor it does not support linux applications at this time.<br/><br/>Design: This device is a bright attractive white chromebook. I find the design to be pleasing to the eye and appears sturdy even though it is made from plastic. I do not particularly like using it in tablet mode. The screen feels bulky and sometimes unmanageable in tablet mode. The screen quickly transitions to whatever position to place it in whether laptop, tent, or tablet mode. I personal find myself not even using my LG tablet for much of anything except when I need LTE internet away from home. Overall the design is great.<br/><br/>Screen/Input: I find the keyboard to be on par with most laptop keyboards. The keys are a little shallow and I feel my typing has slowed a little bit, but not by much. The IPS touchscreen is very responsive and rarely find myself having to touch the screen more than once for my intended gesture. Screen is bright in home conditions, but feel it would lack in more intense lighting situations, such as outdoors.<br/><br/>Ease of Use: The google play store makes this thing be able to do just about anything. I have not tried any intense applications. I use chrome, netflix, hulu, evernote, several banking apps, and various other apps. All of them are snappy responsive. The bank apps load like they are in phone mode, thus they are in a small window. The apps still work as designed. Netflix and Hulu playback is smooth and pleasant to watch on the screen.<br/><br/>Overall, I am impressed with the Google OS and this device in general. If your someone who is on the fence about the operating system, I suggest you give it a try. The battery life is good as well. When using my gaming laptop its always with a cord tethered nearby. I also understand a gaming laptop is far more power intensive. I have yet to use this chromebook while charging it. The battery has allowed me to watch 4-5 hours of netflix, talk on facebook, and text through my phone without ever getting critically low. I charge it at night and then never put it back on till the next night. This is a max screen brightness. I was also very surprised with the speakers. The speakers were much louder and not distorted. I honestly expected them to be cheap netbook quality that is mostly better just to never use them, but thats not the case with this chromebook. I do generally use a bluetooth headset. The bluetooth headset paired with extreme simplicity. I also set up my brother wireless laser printer with google cloud print in less than 30 seconds.<br/><br/>Google did it right and lenovo delivered a solid product. I did purchase this on sale for $200 but would have spent the $300. If your a web surfer, music listener, netflix watcher I highly recommend this. If you need windows intense software then go with windows. Otherwise I think you'll find yourself using this as your primary device as I have.</span>

<span>I like the fact that it's a touchscreen and that you can place in all kinds of different positions to use it as a laptop and tablet without needing anything else. I've had it for close to a year and haven't had any issues at all.<br/> All Chromebooks come with only 8 years of software updates that start at time of manufacture. Mine was brand new but only had 4 left. For me the price made it a no brainier. In 4 years I'll just buy another one.</span>

<span>I was curious on what a chromebook had to offer since i never used or owned one and i'm in need of a laptop since i'm living somewhere else.<br/><br/>This chromebook is fairly light and small and gets the job done and there little to no wait time when you open the chromebook turning on automatically.<br/><br/>There a bunch of things i noticed while using it is you can link your phone with the chromebook in where once you previously log into the chromebook beforehand you can unlock your chromebook right after by unlocking your phone (both have to have bluetooth enable). To search up shortcuts you can easily click the search button on the keyboard and type in shortcut and it have it where you can search all the shortcuts you can do and what nice is any additional keyboard say a bluetooth one can also do some of the shortcuts.<br/>Also there are options where you can close the laptop and you have two options you can either put the laptop to sleep or it just turns off the screen then there a option to lock it by closing it or not. nice note is if you have display off you can still listen to pandora,mp3,or youtube.<br/><br/>Also for those who are wondering - you can play minecraft, ragnorak mobile (not fully keyboard control it only for texting in chat so no WASD movement) and hearthstone on it so it have it nice touch but you cant use the split screen feature from chrome so that a bummer now for the drawbacks. Also you can use microsoft word, excel and powerpoint from the googleplay store but you would need a account for it or just use the free online version.<br/><br/>This is small nit pick - the screen is 720p yet it clear but it is noticeable when you use it long enough wish it was HD or 1080p also some apps are set to the 720p by default. the google play store youtube uses the quality of the screen while chrome youtube (basically youtube normally on browser) is more clear. Also skype doesn't have screenshare or sharesound so that a major bummer and skype seem to run slow on the chromebook in terms having people sharescreen their desktop it always come out blurry on some occasions and i have to minimize and reopen skype to actually see what going on. i haven't try video call yet so it up to debate. Lastly for discord from google playstore you would need to adjust some of the call setting for it to work. the default setting would cut you off mid sentence and random pausing in between.<br/>Another thing is you can't adjust the idle timer it either it goes to sleep, display turns off or stays on there no option to change it and when you have option to lock your desktop it end your skype call so you would have to go into settings for normal use, call use, and game use.<br/>lastly is your better off having your laptop go into sleep mode with locked instead of turning it off. when you shut it down the screen goes blank white then gets brighter and brighter then goes to black. it's just me being paranoid like it would be better if it just dims and turns off instead of going very bright then poof black not to mention if you usually play on medium to low brightness setting then having your screen go maximum brightness with no setting to change it get annoying not to mention when you open up your chromebook after shutting it off it adjusted your brightness setting as well as well a bright chrome logo before going into login. Mostly this is a nit pick since it bothersome when you are using it in middle of the night then when you turn it off it hit you with the brightest setting so i just end up closing it to sleep mode or shut off and look away.<br/><br/>All in all it a pretty good chromebook i just wish it had more options in the settings as well have priority app settings in task manager</span>

<span>I personally love this laptop, in fact, I'm writing this review on this laptop, but that's only because it's the right laptop for my needs. This laptop is not for everyone, because I don't believe it's all that practical to be used for multimedia purposes, AKA, gaming and streaming, etc. There are specific reasons why I say this, and one of the reasons for that, is yes, just like the other reviewers say, the screen is a bit to be desired.<br/><br/>First, I'd like to say that the screen isn't bad, it's just not great. It is a full HD display, but you do pretty much have to look straight at it to get a clear picture. You can see it okay from certain angles, but nothing too fancy. That's why I don't think it's good for multimedia, for example, if you want a laptop to stream movies and watch shows with friends and family, I would not recommend this laptop. It'll stream it just fine, because this computer is very fast, but the picture won't give a clear picture to a group of people watching it. However, if it was you, then I'd say go for it.<br/><br/>The other reason why I don't think this laptop is good for multimedia use, is because of the audio. I am going to be brutally honest when I say that the audio on this laptop is absolutely horrible. I put max volume on my Spotify, and it the volume was so unimpressive, that I could comfortably hold a conversation with someone next to it. So, not only will the screen give a person issues, but unless you have a good speaker connected, you're not going to hear any music, shows, or movies very well with this one.<br/><br/>I also don't recommend gaming on this laptop, not just for the reasons already stated above, but because of performance. This computer can perform very well at several multimedia tasks in terms of processor and memory, and you could play some simple games. But the moment you talk about WoW, or Overwatch... well, let's just say I don't believe this laptop was designed to be a gaming laptop.<br/><br/>That all being said, I love this computer because I don't need a laptop for gaming, or for multimedia purposes. I am a writer, and I also love doing research, and doing basic stuff like checking email, or Reddit. For those basic tasks, this computer is actually quite phenomenal. Because of the SSD (Solid State Drive for those that don't know), it boots up very fast. It could be completely off, and from the time I push the button to turn it on, to the time the computer is ready for whatever task I want to do, barely 4 or 5 seconds have passed. That is not an exaggeration!<br/><br/>The battery lasts for several hours, as long as you're smart about it. Like making sure the light on the keyboard is either off or low, when using the battery, and turning the screen brightness down. You can google tricks like that to extend battery life on all kinds of electronics, but as long as you do those basic things, the battery should last at least 6-7 hours.<br/><br/>The processor is super fast, and I never have to wait more than seconds, if that, for the computer to act on anything I do. The moment I click on Google Chrome, the browser and my personal front page is up in less than 2 seconds. This computer is very fast, and despite what I've said before about the screen and audio, it actually does stream Netflix and all the other streaming apps pretty well.<br/><br/>To anyone wanting to play games, watch movies with friends/family, or listen to loud music, I would not recommend this laptop. However, if you want a laptop to do everything else, I would not only recommend this laptop, but I would even go so far as to say that it's the best one on the market, for its price.</span>

<span>The 8GB RAM can be a problem if you're using Windows. However, if you're a programmer, researcher etc and you usually run your code on a server this little cheap piece of hardware is the best you can get at this price. I'm running Archlinux on this (and mint from a usb boot) and it works great.</span>

<span>Before purchasing, I read the reviews and thought how bad can the speakers be?<br/>The SPEAKERS are horrible! Constantly trying to adjust to every video. Volume turned up to 100% and still sounds like 40%. I really have no other complaints. If they fixed this issue, I would buy a second one.</span>
