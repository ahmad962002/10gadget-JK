<span>i got this as a gift for my boyfriend since he has a habit of breaking his earbuds somehow.<br/>i was a little skeptical because theyre more expensive than other headphones/earbuds but hes never had beats before and i know that they last. i have the wireless beats earbuds and so far theyve lasted 3 years of studying, walking to classes, and workouts. i would expect these to last just as long. the headphones got here within the time that was expected and he absolutely loves them!<br/>i got to try them and theyre very comfortable and even got me thinking about getting a pair myself. the noise cancelling was ok but then again ive never had noise cancelling so i dont know if my expectations were too high. anyway, they were super easy to set up and the battery on them is insane!!<br/><br/>sidenote: if youre worried about the leathery part ripping or getting stained i would recommend getting covers for them. they fit over perfectly and come in different colors and theyre on amazon!</span>

<span>I really love this headset.  I first tried the Bose ($269.) and sent it back because it didn't fit my head right.  For every step I took, I had to adjust the inside foam was too soft also.  I finally sent them back and ordered the Sony over-the-ear headset, which was similar in price.  When they arrived, I put them on and immediately saw they fit better.  The sound quality was amazing in both the Bose and the Sony but had they fit right, I would have picked the Bose for a bit better bass.  After a week, I didn't want to admit it, but the Sony Headset was also a bit big, and I do walk around with it frequently so I had to send them back.  I lost hope and stopped looking until I saw these Beats.  The price was perfect, and I gave them a shot. When I put them on, they were so comfy and snug.  I even danced with them.  The quality of sound is fine but not as good as the Bose.  I love how quickly it connects to my Apple devices.  I love these, but it was the fit that sold me. But I did not get any warning that the battery was low, although it did last quite a long time. It did recharge quickly. It only has a pause and up-and-down loudness selection on one of the earpieces.  You must ask Siri or whoever if you want to fast-forward a song.</span>

<span>If you can get these on sale, buy. Bought these for $150 and think at that price, these headphones are near perfect.<br/><br/>Bass seems to be a hot topic. If you listen to dance/EDM, EDM influenced pop, or hip hop/rap, bass levels are very good. I tried listening to other genres, and bass is barely there.<br/><br/>I thought about Sony, but for $150+ extra and no Siri support, they were a no go.<br/><br/>Battery life is amazing. Definitely live up to claim.<br/><br/>Cushions are comfy. I’ve listened to music nonstop for 3+ hours and my ears didn’t hurt.</span>

<span>I own Studio Wireless 1's. The speakers I use in my home audio system are Totems with a Yamaha receiver. I mostly listen to hip-hop, jazz, classical, and deep house. My review is mostly around upgrading from Studio Wireless 1's.<br/><br/>Is it my imagination or do these 3's don't hit as hard as the wireless 1's? It doesn't feel like it. Something new I discovered is that the low freq are present-more than in my 1's. It's nice-it's that rumbling bass. I'm just not happy that the 808s don't hit as hard as expected. Same sound stage as 1's which isn't much but there is some. They're not as open as some headphone/amp combos I've tried (I'm listening via Studio 3 and iPhone). I WANT to see my music and feel each musician in front of me to the left or right, close or farther away. But I had to replace my Wireless 1's cuz the ear pads were chewed up from being old (the old leather was breaking up in to annoying small bits). New ear pads off Amazon were $46. So $199 for Studio 3's, I just decided to upgrade. Apple AirPods Max were on my list, but the price of those were putting me off. I would have liked to try spatial audio and the fit. In the end with the genres of music I listen to and the fact I want to support Dre led me to pull the trigger on Studio 3's.<br/><br/>If you're deciding on headphones, know that my 1's would slip from my ears. A girl I saw using AirPods Max said that wasn't happening to her. Studios are comfortable to wear. For colors, I'm missing matte grey. I got mine in black.<br/><br/>Very well worth it and on sale. It was easy to pull the trigger on these.</span>

<span>I got these as a gift for my wife.

I’ve compared them to some of my own very expensive headphones and they honestly do sound quite good. I’d be perfectly happy with them myself, especially for traveling.<br/><br/>The price is right, the battery life, build quality and sound quality are great. I’d happily buy them again.</span>

<span>The noise cancelation is really good. Like really good. But there are a couple complaints. They won't always block the same amount of noise, so if you live in a semi noisy environment, that really changes the way you look at these headphones. You can hear when the quality of this feature specifically, drops or rises. A really simple fix though, just turn the volume up a little more. Then it really is just you and the music. The transparency mode I felt just slightly let down. It can be better. Speak to chat is much more powerful which upsets me because it's like you don't even have headphones on. You end up wanting that kind of immersion on demand when it's only attainable through the speak/hold to chat features. Of course when those are enabled, the volume of your music gets reduced HEAVILY, so you can hear what's going on. If you're just turning on ambient noise, you might find it muddy or just not as clear as you'd expect or want. An amazing feature with ambient noise though,  is you can control how much noise comes through. This helps me a lot because if you are feeling overwhelmed by your environment, you can just turn it down or shut it off completely. I guess you can say you have a lot of choices between complete isolation, and near perfect immersion. The pros, in my opinion, really overpower the cons. The sound quality is amazing. You can expect crisp, clear, quality audio with insane customization. The separation and sound staging are quite precise I'd say, and with the app you can have practically unlimited bass while still maintaining crisp, prominent highs, that do not interrupt or drown out the mids. Of course the amount of depth these headphones have can only make you dream of what more they may be capable of. I absolutely love the equalizer because now you have such a range with your listening experience, you can resonate with music on so many different levels using the equalizer. These headphones are built for every genre of music BECAUSE they're so precise and customizable as far as sound goes. That's a massive plus, interpreting a song differently because you changed the way it sounded. The smaller drivers do not in any way take from the sound quality. They sound like quality headphones, and the volume control is consistent. The sound quality does not change until about maybe 90-100%. They fit nice, but I wish the design were more like travel headphones where you fold the cups into themselves. They feel very durable, especially the headband. The touch sensors are nice too, but I wish you could use both cups instead of one, so you can customize what taps do what. Overall, they were worth the money. They're for everyone, however you listen, and whatever you listen to. Your preference in sound can be a lot more precise using these headphones. I mean, they really make it hard to say another pair is better. I have grown a lot with these headphones, musically speaking. There are no boundaries in the world of music, and there certainly are not limitations to reach that boundless world inside these headphones.</span>

<span>No Doubt these are excellent headphones. Sony has taken an already established series and made them better. Some may not like that they don’t fold down but the case is slim and it should mean better durability in the long run so I have no issues with it at all as far as that goes. My only real complaints are that the wear sensor rarely works, really 1 out of 10 times will the headphones pause when I remove them…I don’t know if it is because of the sensor being set inside the fabric vs. outside like the M4’s, or something else. May be just my unit I suppose. I don’t absolutely need it to work especially since the touch controls work really well so I can live with that. The only other issue is for comfort. Don’t get me wrong, overall they are super light and comfortable but the light padding on the headband does cause some discomfort after awhile. A little adjustment and it is better but could be an issue for some. I also wish that Sony could do something to make the headphones power on and connect more quickly. If you have them connected to two devices it takes about 10 seconds to connect to both. However the connection is strong and I have no issues with that! And the multi point function works flawlessly!<br/>Noise Cancelling is no doubt the reason to buy these headphones and it is best in class, but as with all noise cancelling headphones there are limitations. It blocks a lot of noise, no doubt, but if the song playing is quiet or the quiet spots between tracks then noise can get through in those moments. It does not block 100% of noise, but it is probably the best I’ve ever tested.<br/>Battery life is as expected, but if you like it loud with max noise canceling as well as the DSEE Extreme and Equalizer enabled the battery life definitely takes a hit, but is still good.<br/>Sound quality is really good. It is not as good as some of my other headphones from Bang and Olufsen, Sennheiser or arguably even the AirPods Max, but is up there. For overall features and noise cancelling these cannot be beat! Another great thing is the speak to chat. It works really well but I keep it off most of the time because it’ll be triggered too easily with a cough or a hum but the great thing is you can toggle the feature on or off by pressing two fingers to the touch pad. Game changer! So if I’m entering a store, for example, I can toggle it on when I enter and then toggle it back off on the way out! That is so awesome to me! Makes the feature so much more sensible for me.<br/>One last note is on the color: I chose the “platinum silver” because I read the black was a finger-print magnet and I wanted to avoid that. This color is okay but kind of blah. But although the headphones are made of recycled materials it still has a slightly more premium build quality than some but is nowhere the build quality of some others like the Bang &amp; Olufsen Beoplay H95’s. But they are unbelievably light weight so that is a good reason to go with those materials. I also love the simple packaging they come in with no plastic and no waste. It’s a nice eco-friendly way to go and I applaud them for that! Overall, these are first-rate headphones and I would highly recommend them (even over the M’4’s as I like the new design and the sound quality, to my ears at least, is improved over the old model).<br/>Update: September 27, 2022. I had to downgrade these to 4 stars because of the wear sensor. Overall they are great, but the wear sensor not working is really bugging me because I feel it should work, after all the XM4’s had a wear sensor that worked much more reliably and since this is the follow up it should work at least as well, if not better. Curious if anyone else has this issue or if it’s just my unit. Also on several occasions the touch control has become completely non responsive and I’ve had to power them off and on again to get it to work again. A little frustrating (especially when you look like an idiot banging repeatedly on the ear cup trying to get it respond).</span>

<span>I have been using Sony noise canceling earbuds for the last couple of years. I own both the XM3 and XM4 models and I have come to really love both the sound quality and the extra features Sony has packed them. Fast bear on android is amazing, it works without any effort. The first time you turn it on or if you turn it on in pairing mode a picture of the headphones will pop up on a nearby android device and you just click connect, it is as simple as connecting air pods to an iPhone.<br/><br/>Onto these headphones, they are exceptional. Battery life is amazing, but that is to be expected from any premium wireless over your headphones.<br/>The touch controls have a bit of a learning curve, but they are for the most part very good (I have one issue with them, but I will get to that later).<br/>The noise cancelling is amazing of course, but what is more impressive is the improvements made to transparency mode. It no longer picks up background noise from fans and cars as much as it used to. Support for Spotify tap means you can launch Spotify, and have it pick up where you left off without even touching your phone.<br/>The new safe listening feature tells you if you are listening to music at unsafe levels for too long. It keeps track of how much time you listen at various decibel levels so it can tell you if you have been listening too much.<br/>Sound quality is of course very good. Also, Sony's EQ is not the best, but for most people it is more than sufficient. If you like a bit more or less base you can adjust all of that very easily, and it comes with several presets.<br/><br/>The issues:<br/><br/>I have had three issues with my headphones so far. The first one was a strange bug where it identified to my phone as the FCC registered model number instead of as WH 1000 XM5 with a reset after a firmware update.<br/>The next issue is that I have not been able to get it to register with Google's find my device service, it is not a huge deal for me especially because I am less likely to leave the headphones somewhere that I am something smaller like earbuds, but it seems like that can be a bit hit or miss.<br/>The last issue is one that I alluded to earlier, and it is with the touch controls. These headphones do not have a physical Google assistant or any digital assistant button, instead you either say the wake word, or press and hold on the radio until you hear a tone. There is a strange bug when I tried to reply to a text that the Google assistant just read to me. It records my reply, but then says to push the Google assistant button to send or press and hold to record the message. You cannot push the Google assistant button, or you can do is press and hold which will just record the message so you cannot send your reply. However, this does not seem to be an issue when you just try to send a text, only when you reply so it is not the end of the world.<br/><br/>Well, that ended up being longer than I thought it would. I hope someone has found this helpful because I just spent far too long writing it.</span>

<span>I'm not a music expert, but I do consider an audiophile as I listen to music extensively throughout the day. I have never spent more than $120 on earphones/headphones, but I wanted to know what "expensive" headphones would sound like. I purchased these right before they were released, and just in time because I would've bought the WH-1000XM4 instead. Here's my take:<br/><br/>I like my music LOUD. At first, the max volume on the headphones was annoyingly low. I then realized that the issue was that the headphones internal volume was linked to the phone volume, but it was not at the highest setting. I had to (on an Android phone) separate both volumes, then unpair the headphones. After this, I paired them again and set the phone volume to max. From there, I increased the volume on the headphones using the touch controls until they were at max (the headphones will tell you.) This was a tremendous change and I am now satisfied with the volume.<br/><br/>The bass on these headphones are great, but I like deeper bass, to where it should sound muddled, so these did not meet my expectations. However, the bass is really good and doesn't muddle the rest of the music.<br/><br/>The noise cancellation is incredible. There is a HUGE change in what you hear with and without the noise cancellation. It doesn't completely blot out voices (or a television) but with pop music on 30%, you won't be able to hear external noise. The "see through" mode (hear through) amplifies the sounds around you so you can hear them while you listen to music, but if your music volume is above 40%, you still won't hear anything from the outside, unless it's very loud.<br/><br/>The headphones (with the app) come with a cool feature where they stop playback and enable the "hear-through" mode so that you can talk to people without having to either take off the headphones or stop your music. It works well, unless you're like me and you sing the songs you listen to. The music WILL stop if the headphones hear you singing.<br/><br/>Another cool feature is that if you remove the left earcup, music playback stops. This is because the headphones detect that you have taken them off. It's not a new feature among earphone tech (I have sub $100 earphones that do the same) but it's a neat trick that is useful to some of us. It appears that the sensor is only on the left earcup because removing only the right earcup does not stop music playback.<br/><br/>All in all, I am quite happy with me $400 headphones. The case is sturdy and cool-looking and definitely feels like expensive quality. Battery life is great and charging time is impressive (40 minutes according to my measures).</span>

<span>Out of the box, the bass was set to +9 on a headphone made for bass.  So, I can see how some people might've been turned off by this headphone.  I listen to wide range of music but mostly EDM and this headphone is made for that genre.  But, you have to install the accompanying SONY headphone control app on your phone in order to configure the sound to your liking.  Otherwise, it's too heavy on the bass.  With the control, you turn up the bass when you want to and turn it down when you want something more relaxing.  Decent highs and mids.  Good overall headphone but it's not for you unless you prefer brain rattling bass like me.</span>

<span>I bought these back in 2016 and have used them on and off since then. Most recently as a college student, driving my need for wireless option.<br/><br/>SOUND QUALITY: While the sound quality is adequate, I am a person who loves heavy bass, which this does not give, but the sound quality overall is pretty good.<br/><br/>NOISE CANCELLATION: It also does not completely cancel out noice, but does muffle/buffer it. In Starbucks, I had to turn up the volume on my computer to 75% to drown out talking. Likewise, poolside at the YMCA, I also have to amp up the volume to get any true buffering from the high sound. I am easily distractible so these are not ideal for noise distractions.  Even at home with dogs and kids, I find that, no matter what, I have to amp up the volume for buffering, otherwise I hear quite a bit.  I don't notice a significant difference in turning off the ANC. The same goes for vacuuming, yard work (such as using a blower) and mowing the lawn.<br/><br/>COMFORT: The headphones are over ear and pretty comfortable to wear for extended periods of time. I have yet to experience significant fatigue from it.  I don't notice any extensive sweating while wearing them, either, which some have said is an issue with over the ear headphones. Granted, I'm not sleeping in them, either.<br/><br/>DURABILITY: Over the several affordable on/over ear headphones I purchased for my daughters' use with online work, these were the ones she kept coming to and the only ones that have held up over the years. The cord is pretty durable, especially since I don't have a case for it and it often gets tossed into a drawer or backpack willy-nilly (yes, an outdated term, I know).<br/><br/>COMPARABILITY: I have tried the Bose SoundLink II and Beats Solo3, both wireless headphones. If you are looking for comparable sound, you won't find it. Both Bose and Beats have these headphones beat, as would be expected based on price! However, I see quite a few complaints regarding durability of the material over time. I have no experience with comparison of Bose or Beats as these are recent purchases from family members. I can attest to the durability of my Sony headphones.<br/><br/>CONVENIENCE: I like that my Sony headphones can work well with my 2018 MacBook Pro, as Apple didn't see fit to change the headphone jack for any of their computers from the 3.5mm jack to a lightning jack. I use the adapter on my iPhone and it works fine. I've used these headphones to run on a treadmill several times and they stay put. I'm not running sprints or marathons, though. However, they are wired, and wired ONLY. Meaning I can't be wireless, and they don't connect to my iWatch.<br/><br/>For convenience due to connectivity with all of my devices, I would say that Beats Solo3 Wireless has everything I need, since I have all Apple devices and I really like having everything working together. Even my Alexa devices and Alexa Compatible plugs work harmoniously together and with my Apple devices. As a result, I will be looking for a wireless option that offers good durability and superior noise cancelling capabilities, though I won't be getting rid of these, as they really are great quality headphones, as expected with Sony (considering I grew up in a time where Sony was considered right up there, before Bose became a more well-known entity in the market).</span>

<span>I have been looking for a solution that can work with my phone and my PC, and these do the job. Sound is pretty decent, and moving back and forth is reasonably easy. Battery life is good enough for a day (with a break to charge at lunch). Main problem is that while you can extend the arms on each side to get a custom fit, the cups still are tight on the ears and get to be uncomfortable after about 30 minutes. Take a break and leave them off, and then you're good to go again - but it would be nice if they either had more cushioning or used a material that was more "ear friendly".</span>

<span>I bought these to drown out the noise from a loud air conditioner and PC fans in a small room. They definitely cancel out almost all of the surrounding noise, so I can hear my music, games, YouTube videos, class material, etc. very clearly. You will always want to have them powered on, as the sound quality is pretty poor when the power switch is off. When powered on, the sound quality is surprisingly good - not the best I've heard, but more than acceptable given the price. Bass is nice and deep, highs are clear. The cord is a tad short, so don't think you'll be moving away while you're wearing them at your desk. Overall I am very happy with these headphones.</span>

<span>I bought these headphones to replace an older pair of Sony headphones where the foam covers had begun to peel off. They fit well and feel comfortable. My ears are not sensitive enough to judge the sound quality, but I had no problems hearing the sound. I would guess the noise cancelling works well as it, at least, muffled the sound of an air conditioner nearby.<br/>My only complaint is with the length of the cord. I bought these wired headphones specifically because not everything I would use it with has wireless capability. The cord would do fine with a device that I held in my hand or on my lap, but I also want to use it attached to a desktop computer. In this case, I found it hard to use the keyboard, due to the shortness of the cord. I measured it against the old set's cord and found the new set's cord is about 18" shorter. I will need to get a short extension cable to use it with the computer.<br/>An additional note: had known or realized that the foam covers could be replaced, I would have bought the available replacements, rather than a new set of headphones.</span>

<span>Firstly these are on the smaller size-I have little ears and these JUST barely fit.<br/>In regards to the noise cancelling I expected alot more. I attend virtual hypnosis so was hoping to help cancel out the noise of my daughter in the other room that I could still hear over the loud fan I use as white noise. I tried them prior and these did not cancel out any sound except the very light hum of my fridge. Any voice was clear as day and it did not say that on the product description-it was labeled on the insert that I received. They essentially were useless to me and I am returning them.</span>

<span>The headline says it all.  I'm not an audiophile; I'm a regular 60+ year old guy who planned to use these to listen to music, podcasts, youtube, and/or the occasional streaming movie.  For me, the sound quality was clear and decent. I had no complaints on that front. The noise cancelling feature does work, but it won't silence anything louder than an oscillating fan. That's all the good I can think to say.<br/><br/>For the rest of the story; they feel seriously, painfully cheap. Hard, machine punched plastic slapped together with small, also plastic bits.  These feel like they wouldn't withstand any length of time under the gentlest care. Toss them around? Drop them?  Stuff them in your bag?  The earpieces would likely snap off the headband in weeks.<br/><br/>There's a cord running from both earpieces - obvious from the photo's - but the set these were going to replace had one cord on the left ear, and maybe it won't be an issue for you, but I didn't like it. Personal preference, I suppose.<br/><br/>I would have kept them longer to see how they aged, but my breaking point was the comfort, or lack thereof. There's not much padding and they're on ear, not over. I had to take them off after about 30 minutes.  It was more of an issue with the left ear than the right, but these were unbearably uncomfortable.</span>

<span>(This is a lengthy review, so in case you are short on time I have included a quick Pros/Cons summary at the top.  This gives an idea of my overall opinions, but for more details continue to read on below.)<br/>(Note- I will mostly be comparing these to other earbuds that I have used and/or reviewed recently: AirPods Pro, Samsung Galaxy Buds Pro, Sony WF-1000XM4, Echo Buds2, and Klipsch T5 II )<br/><br/>THE GOOD:<br/>--Comfort/Fit:  So far, these are very comfortable to wear.  They are slightly smaller than some of the other earbuds I've tested, and are up there with Airpods Pro in terms of comfort.  They also feel very secure in the ear, unlike some other brands.  No complaints here with comfort/design.<br/><br/>--Mic Quality:  The mic quality of these is excellent.  I tested out with calling friends, and these were either 1st or 2nd best sounding earbuds according to the people I called.  My friend says that these mics are the best out the earbuds we tested in this range.<br/><br/>--Multiple Ecosystem Support:  These work well with all ecosystems, whether you are using Apple or Android; and with assistants including Alexa and Google.<br/><br/>--Good ANC :  The noise canceling on these is also fantastic.  This technology has come a long way, and sometimes it can be hard to compare ANC, since each company produces earbuds that prioritize blocking out slightly different frequencies.  To me these seem like they are close to the best , but maybe the XM4s and Airpods Pro are SLIGHTLY better, especially the XM4s at low frequency ranges.  The Adaptive Sound Control is a neat feature that can change ambient sound settings based on your location, though I'm not sure how useful this will be in practice.<br/><br/>THE BAD:<br/><br/>--Overall Sound Comparison:  With the default EQ settings, the overall sound quality actually seems slightly worse than the WF1000XM4s to me.  I also prefer the sound of the Klipsch T5 IIs with most music, and even the Galaxy Pros with some songs; as these LinkBuds S can sometimes sound slightly muffled or dampened in comparison.  Still good quality sound overall, just not as good as some of the other options in this range, and not my favorite with any type of music I tested.<br/><br/>--No Wireless Charging:  This seems like a big disappointment for this price range.  I would expect that ALL earbuds that are over $200 should have wireless charging at this point.<br/><br/>MORE DETAILS:<br/>Here are my thoughts on each category, again mostly comparing to:  Airpods Pro, Samsung Galaxy Buds Pro, Sony WF-1000XM4, Echo Buds2, and Klipsch T5 II.  (I also enlisted the help of a friend of mine that is an Audio Engineer, to give his opinions and to use some of his equipment.)<br/><br/>Sound -  These sounded great to me when I first put them in and listened to a variety of music.  I was not disappointed in overall sound quality at all, and if you aren't comparing these to anything else, you will also probably think that they sound great.  It was only after rigorously measuring their output with my friend's mics, and also repeatedly comparing them to all of the other earbuds,  that I was able to notice the slightly muffled sound compared to the other earbuds.  The Airpods Pro, Klipsch T5 II, XM4, and Galaxy Pro all seem slightly more “clear”, with a broader range.  The midrange on the Airpods Pro might be the biggest difference here, and when I switched back and forth between them I felt like I was missing some of those midrange frequencies with the LinkBuds S.  Overall sound range/EQ preferences are of course very subjective and personal, but my friend and I both agree that these are definitively not our favorite in this category.<br/><br/>Design/Fit – I like the way that these fit in my ear, and they are right up there at the top with Airpods and Klipsch in terms of being lightweight and comfortable.  For me, the Galaxy Pros were a little to clunky and felt like they might fall out sometimes, but the LinkBuds S fit great while also feeling secure.  The texture of the buds themselves is almost a little scratchy, which took me a little while to get used to, but I think I prefer this texture for touch sensitivity.  For me though, I have always preferred the press-able buttons on the Klipsch T5 IIs over all of these touch sensors, partly because I often wear a headband over the earbuds and a sweaty headband can mess with the touch sensors sometimes.<br/><br/>Calls – This is probably the best overall feature of these earbuds.  The microphone quality seemed to be the best out of all the earbuds when testing out on my friend's equipment, and in real-world testing I experienced similar results.  These were either the best sounding, or a close second best when compared to other earbuds when making calls.  These sounded the best in almost every environment, maybe tied for best with Klipsch in noisy/windy environments.<br/><br/>Water Resistance - These have the same IPX4 rating as most of the other earbuds, but note that the Galaxy Buds Pro have a superior IPX7 rating, if that matters to you.  So far these have been working great for exercise, but again personally I prefer more headband-friendly designs sometimes.<br/><br/>Charging/etc:  These charge at about the same speed as the other earbuds, and have a similar battery life.  The BIG difference is that these don't support wireless charging, which seems odd at this price range.  These come with a short 9 inch usb-A to usb-C cable in the box, no plug/brick.  This is my least favorite in terms of charging options compared to the other earbuds in this price range.<br/><br/>OVERALL:  These are solid earbuds that feel great, produce good sound, have good ANC, and have excellent microphones for great call quality.  They do just about everything well, but at this current price I can't say that they are my favorite, or even the best value.  Overall my favorites are probably still the Klipsch T5 IIs, which are currently less expensive than these LinkBuds S earbuds at the time I'm writing this.  My second favorite would either be the Galaxy Pros or the Airpod Pros, both of which are slightly less expensive and produce slightly better sound in my opinion.  The only thing these LinkBuds S are the best at seems to be the mic/call quality, but even then the difference there isn't big enough for me to recommend choosing them overall.  Personally I'm sticking with my Klipsch T5 IIs for regular use, but if you are a diehard Apple user, I would have recommend the Airpods Pro over these LinkBuds S at the current prices.  If these drop in price in the future and are competitively priced with some of the other options, then they might be a good choice; especially if switching back and forth between ecosystems is important to you and you don't mind the lack of wireless charging.</span>

<span>So, a few key things to say about this product, and how I use it. This rating is purely based on my experience with it.<br/><br/>On my end, first, I went with a refurbished version. Second, I'll easily use them 8-12 hours a day, definitely more than some people. 3rd, I'm often in somewhat louder environments.<br/><br/>How have these Sony earbuds held up? A few weeks in, I have had some serious issues with the noise cancelling aspect. Sometimes, one or both earbuds will give loud, high pitched,  static or feedback. The only thing that seemed to 'fix' that issue is by putting both bids back into the case to reset them. The other option is actually to turn the noise cancelling off in the app. I'd say that's the biggest issue.<br/><br/>A somewhat minor problem is, the app almost gets in the way more than it helps. I cannot leave the Adaptive Sound Control on, as it changes my settings too often. I prefer to use the Ambient Sound Control (single tap) option, but then you cannot turn off noise cancelling altogether to fix the giant feedback issue. Not really as important is the battery life. Often, I will only get 5 hours in before having to charge them. If I could run noise cancelling on, it actually extends battery life by being able to turn the volume down. Issues have arisen there, however.<br/><br/>I actually Really like how quickly they charge, though. Really did great there. The equalizer included within the app feels decent enough, and the sound is about as good as I've heard.<br/><br/>In all, I do not know if I would say these were worth the money I spent on them. Some issues may have been the fact I went with refurbished, but if it is certified refurbished, then that's Sony endorsed. If they don't want me complaining about issues on a refurbished product, tighten those reins. If they chopped the full price for new ones in half (closer to $100-$110), I'd definitely go for them.</span>

<span>The Sony Linkbuds S are a shrunk-down, improved version of the already excellent WF-1000XM4. I wasn't expecting this. Given the "Linkbuds" moniker I was expecting them to prioritize ambient sound features over all else, just like the original Linkbuds, but that simply isn't the case here.<br/><br/>Build: the Linkbuds S are impossibly small compared to the WF-1000XM4, Sony's previous noise canceling earphones. They actually resemble the Samsung Galaxy buds 2 in overall size and shape. They also sport a nice large touch sensitive area that no one should have trouble missing. The only gripe I do have is that the outer surface is textured and this can cause some discomfort if it rubs against the crus helix.<br/><br/>Case: the case is definitely one of the more pocketable out there. It's about the same size as the Airpods Pro case, but slightly shorter and narrower, albeit a bit thicker. However, it also has a textured surface which can make it a little difficult to slide in and out of pockets.<br/><br/>Fit: the Linkbuds S fit very similar to the Galaxy Buds 2 and deeper than the WF-1000XM4. They are a little fiddly to fit. In my case I have to rotate them back and forth to get them to seat correctly. Although Sony instructs users to rotate the buds backwards to get a good fit I actually found this uncomfortable because the buds would rub against my Crus Helix and cause discomfort. Rotating them forward slightly fixed the issue. Once the buds were in place I found the fit to be secure and that, combined with their light weight, meant that it was easy to forget they were there. My one complaint about the fit is that the buds are so small that it's very difficult to insert them without either accidentally hitting the touch area or rubbing a finger against the noise canceling microphone, resulting in some static noise.<br/><br/>Noise canceling: the noise canceling on the Linkbuds S is fantastic. Although the Linkbuds S are advertised as being open I actually found them to be more isolating than the WF-1000XM4s without noise canceling on. With noise canceling on I actually found the Linkbuds S to be slightly superior to the WF-1000XM4 in terms of blocking out background noise and they certainly blow the Galaxy Buds Pro/2 out of the water. I haven't had chance to test the Linkbuds S with very low frequency sounds (e.g. public transport, planes) but for blocking out office and household noise they're the best true wireless earphones I've tried.<br/><br/>Sound: I saved the best to last. I was very pleasantly surprised with the sound quality of the Linkbuds S. The WF-1000XM4s were a big disappointment in this regard, with an overly dark presentation for my taste that led to recessed mids and lackluster treble. The Linkbuds S by comparison adopt a Harman-like tuning that presents mids and treble brilliantly with a satisfying bass boost that doesn't dominate the overall sound. The Linkbuds S definitely beat the WF-1000XM4s for overall sound and they're up there with the Galaxy Buds Pro/2, which are the reigning champs. Comparing the Galaxy Buds side by side with the Linkbuds S I honestly can't pick a favorite amongst the three, which I think is a very good thing.<br/><br/>Other: in my limited tests the transparency features are great, as with the WF-1000XM4s. The only other thing that I think is worth noting is that the Linkbuds S struggle to maintain LDAC connectivity more than the WF-1000XM4s. This isn't surprising, given the small size, but is worth considering for anyone who wants to use LDAC in challenging environments or on the go.<br/><br/>Wrap up: previously if I wanted to recommend a pair of true wireless earphones for someone I would have to include a 'but'. The Airpods Pro have great noise canceling but the sound isn't top tier and they don't play well with Android devices. The Galaxy Buds sound fantastic but the noise canceling isn't great and they don't play well with iOS. The WF-1000XM4s have top tier noise canceling and work well with both iOS and Android devices, but their sound isn't the best. The Linkbuds S on the other hand have top tier noise canceling, work excellent with both iOS and Android, and have excellent sound. These are now my default recommendation to anyone looking for new True Wireless earphones.<br/><br/>Alternative picks: If it wasn't for the better Bluetooth connectivity of the WF-1000XM4s and the improved battery life the Linkbuds S would have made the XM4s redundant. Whether the increased price is worth it for those things will be up to the individual. I think there's still a case to be made for getting the cheaper Galaxy buds over the Linkbuds S if noise canceling isn't a priority. However, I think the only reason to pay more for the Airpods Pro would be if you really like the design and/or the enhanced integration with iOS is really important.</span>

<span>Really good sound and build quality for the $100 plus price point  Loved the sound. ANC was great. They fit snug. The rest of the build quality was solid. They looked and fit great too. Another plus is the hard shell case that they come in. I would have loved to use this for travel.<br/><br/>But I returned these day one. Here are my reasons. No app from Philips. Just used the built in Bluetooth which relies on Google Assistant (Android). The touch control gets stuck between failing to pause/play and launching the very annoying Google assistant. Touch failed to work well even after disabling Google Assistant. Given I did not feel I could even pause playback reliably, this was a deal breaker for $150 headphones.<br/>Minor complaints:<br/> Had an issue where the manual control button felt like it could break in a few weeks of use.<br/> The fake leather made my ears uncomfortably hot after twenty minutes or so.<br/> No USB-C butt instead micro USB.<br/> Weird 2.5 mm to 3.5 mm jack. Cheap cable included for both the power and audio jack.<br/> Microphone recorded my voice very sub par compared to higher end headphones.</span>

<span>I was looking for a pair of headphones and I wanted something lower priced to start out since I normally stick to my airpods. Overall these are pretty comfortable, I have a small head so they do slip around a little but they cover my ears rather than sitting on ear uncomfortably. Having an actual pair of headphones is great and the sound is ten times better than my airpods, however, the sound leakage is very bad. If I take them off and push them off to the side, even when the volume is very low I can still hear this music. This isn't great especially since I bought them to wear around campus. So these certainly won't be replacing my airpods, but they're a good addition.</span>

<span>The sound quality of these headphones is solid--- crisp mids and defined bass, not too tinny highs. The controls are very intuitive and easy to get used to, and they're comfortable to wear. I really appreciate the overall design, which is minimalist and simple with no shiny bits or excessive branding. A lot of headphones in this price range try really hard to look futuristic or "industrial", which often just makes them look tacky and less comfortable to wear. I like that these are just simple and utilitarian. The one gripe I have is that the construction doesn't feel especially solid--- not cheap by any means, just rather plasticky. However, I would still recommend this to anyone as a solid pair of headphones on a budget.</span>

<span>I normally tend to shop lower prices and tend to think higher prices aren't that much better quality, I was wrong. My wife likes to fall asleep with the tv on and I don't so I play white noise with headphones to drown out whatever TV show she has going on. These headphones are so sound proof I normally don't even need to play a sound to block outside noise. If I ever do play a noise I can't even hear what's happening right next to me. The comfort level is amazing and could even fall asleep with them on if I wanted</span>
