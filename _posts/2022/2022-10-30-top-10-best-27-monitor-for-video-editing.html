<div class="slideshow-container">
<blockquote><em><div class="a-row a-spacing-small review-data"><span class="a-size-base review-text review-text-content" data-hook="review-body">
<span>UPDATED 12/10/21<br/>I use a Macbook Pro 2021 and still attach an external monitor. There seems to be no firmware update available for this monitor. There have been some updates to the Mac OS that caused the monitor to glitch here and there using USB-C and I assumed BenQ would update things but nothing.<br/><br/>Today, I have switched my cable to HDMI in hopes that the glitches stop. But this is only possible because the Macbook Pro added the HDMI port back to the laptops. Maybe it's not BenQ's fault? But what is their fault is that they never brought full funcionality to their USB-C connection. e.g. the physical toggle buttons never worked with USB-C.<br/><br/>There is still some bleeding on the edges of the monitor that is not too visible when I'm working. But you can get some ghosting on the monitor if you leave something on there for a long time, although, that happened with my previous "fancy" monitors, too.<br/><br/>Previous review:<br/>I use a Macbook Pro 2016, I attach an external monitor for full time retouching.<br/><br/>Pros:<br/>- This works well for my every day use. It is a larger monitor than the Macbook so there is a benefit.<br/>- The color and brightness is just right.<br/>- You can rotate the monitor to 90 degrees so that it is vertical if you would like to see those types of shots. The ease of rotating and moving this monitor up and down is great! It glides, ok slides on a track and not much effort. Not like gliding ice, has some friction but doesn't give me trouble. I slide this monitor on the track every day, because I have a sit to stand desk. I wouldn't want to switch to a monitor that doesn't move like this ever again.<br/>- This monitor comes with an external pad with 4 buttons that allows you to choose different color profile settings. There is a grayscale button, that is super cool, imo. Even though when I work with grayscale, I don't really need this button but it is a great option to have. I like the color button toggles, sRGB, Adobe RGB. BUT... that also goes in the Cons section.<br/><br/>Cons:<br/>- When you use this monitor with the USB-C to USB-C cable connection, you lose the ability to use the external color profile buttons for the monitor. They don't work. That's that. No more grayscale option, no sRGB.<br/>- Tech Support? What tech support? Zero response to any questions I've asked.<br/>- There is monitor light bleed in some of the edges and corners of the monitor. I created a black image in Photoshop and filled screen with image to see it, and there it is. But, the Dell monitor here does the same thing so I decided to forgo that. I work in the middle of the screen anyway and you can't tell when you're actually working, unless you put your image on the edge or corner and I don't work up there like that.<br/><br/>Bottom line? I like the monitor. I used to use display port connection (I think I used HDMI to display port) a while back and the external button toggles worked, so if you're using it that way it should be fine. IF you're using USB-C to USB-C, you should get the other BenQ that offers that because the added features with the external color profile buttons on this one no workie. That did tick me off.</span>

<span>I am an advanced hobbyist photographer and bought this monitor to implement an AdobeRBG 10bit workflow for art-grade photo prints on a Canon imagePROGRAF PRO-1000.<br/><br/>This is a solidly built piece of equipment, the stand is very heavy and well constructed. I love the handle built into the stand. Packing was very good: I would not be concerned about damage in shipment. The panel itself is the usual plastic, but it's high quality in appearance and feel. The performance of the panel overall, is excellent. I'm getting verified 10bit workflow in Photoshop through an Nvidia Quadro P2000. I love the puck! Now can't live without it. Switching color spaces with the push of a button near the keyboard is a really nice innovation. The puck itself is a pretty high quality build. The buttons feel good and the display responds well. Monitor menus are pretty nice compared to the Dells I've been using for two decades. This panel blow away my Dell u2718q 27" 4k monitor. They are setup side by side and the dell looks like dog vomit compared to the BENQ, but then, they are not in the same class are they?<br/><br/>This is where the good ends and the not-so-good, to just dumb, begins:<br/> - This panel has a single stuck blue pixel. This is a thousand dollar monitor targeting color perfectionists, so it's going back to amazon for a swap.<br/> - There is some noticeable light bleed on the edges. It's not bad, but it's not great.<br/> - The monitor ships with a DVI-to-mini-DVI cable. However, all the high end Nvidia Quadro cards have full sized DVI sockets, not mini. There is no mini DVI socket on the monitor, so the cable it comes with is useless if you bought a Quadro P1000 or higher. So I had to buy a new DVI to DVI cable. Lost a night of work because of this.<br/> - The driver CD that ships with the monitor doesn't contain the pallet master software. Just download it right?? No... BENQ had an outage last night and so I could not download the pallet master software to verify the calibration and lost another night of work. It's back up today so I was able to download it.<br/> - While I was doing that, saw there was a more recent monitor driver dated 2-5-2018. The one installed is dated 5-5-2017, so I obviously wanted to update. I downloaded the file and discovered it was packed in RAR format. Now kids, I am a huge nerd going way back, but my rar days are over. Luckily my little brother is still a huge nerd and unpacked it for me so i didn't have to download some shady unpacker. I install the driver and guess what? It's the exact same one as the existing one 5-5-2017. It's mislabeled on the BENQ website. I open the INF to very and sure enough. It's v1.0.0.0. So that was 15 minutes ill never get back. Thanks BENQ for wasting more of my time.<br/> - In general, BENQs website performs well  if you live in 1994. It's hosted in Taiwan. RTT to the site is over 200ms. My guess is that BENQ sells a few items in the US, so it might be nice to go ahead and drop a replica of the site over here. That, and hire just one native English speaker to proof your copy. Thanks.<br/> - That calibration report. Yeah there is one, but you will need an electron microscope to read it. The issue is, they have enough content to fill an 8.5x14 sheet of paper but decided to print it on 8.5x11.<br/><br/>Summary<br/>Good thing BENQ know how to build monitors, because they are not good at anything else. Wait, they shipped me a stuck pixel... so I'll rephrase: They're pretty good at building monitors that look great, except for a pixel or two, and light bleed, and they are not good at much else. With BENQ, it's death by a thousand cuts. For the price, I'm still a buy recommendation, but just barely. My advice is to buy this product from amazon so that you can send it back for any reason. BENQ's dead pixel policy would not cover my situation. BENQ should hire a few Apple execs, and implement 4% of what Apple do in terms of fit/finish/polish, which will make BENQ 400% better off than they are now, which means that right now as a business they seem very immature.

<span>The TL;DR is simple: I have found the SW321C to be a phenomenal, no-compromises, nearly flawless monitor. Great stand, great user interface (I love the puck), outstanding image quality, even backlight, no backlight bleed. It's superb for work and leisure. There's IPS glow, but that's unavoidable.<br/><br/>I'm a programmer who spends most of his time on his computer -- reading/writing text, watching video, and playing games. Previously I was using 2 Dell U2518D monitors, which, even after calibration with an iDisplay Pro Plus, had the following issues:<br/>* Crushed blacks<br/>* Poor contrast<br/>* Uneven colors<br/>* Uneven backlight<br/>* Backlight bleed<br/>* Glare, despite the matte surface<br/><br/>After deciding I didn't want to put up with those issues any longer, I did a week or two of research on what the best no-compromises monitors were in late 2020. That led me to the SW321C, a professional monitor rather than a gaming/consumer monitor, because consumer models -- no matter how fancy they claimed to be or how slick the marketing -- all seemed to fall short and require me to resign myself to compromises in at least one area (and I didn't want FALD).<br/><br/>The BenQ SW321C is expensive (though not as expensive as the EIZO and Dell screens that it's often compared to), but I consider the money well spent. The image quality is outstanding. Colors are stunning. Images and text are markedly sharper and crisper than they were on my 25" 1440p monitors (though this would be true of any 4k 32" screen). The backlight is the evenest I've ever seen. There's no backlight bleed that I can detect. I love the shade hood and never take it off. The matte coating is far and away the best I've seen/used.<br/><br/>For the movies and tv shows I've watched on it (Blade Runner, Ex Machina, The Witch, The Expanse, The Man in the High Castle, The Midnight Gospel), I couldn't be happier with the quality of the picture. The HDR may be "fake," but it still massively improves the viewing experience, especially in regard to handling of darkness/shadows.<br/><br/>Last year I bought and returned the BenQ SW271. I loved it, but the backlight was uneven, there was backlight bleed, and 27" was too small for 4K". (32" is, for my eyes (late 30s), the perfect size for a 4k screen.) If I was going to spend $1,500, I wasn't willing to put up with those issues.<br/><br/>The SW321 isn't as bright as the SW271, which is a shame, but it also fixes every issue I had with the SW271.<br/>==<br/>Update: the blacks aren't as dark as I'd like them to be. (EDIT: correction, for $2k you can NOT get a very decent oled tv with perfect blacks. You will experience burn in.) The monitor also seems to produce a lot of heat. I'm not sure I regret the purchase. It still ticks all the boxes for me, and I consider the money well spent, but if I could do it again, and my living quarters allowed it, (EDIT and recantation: I would not opt for an OLED)<br/><br/>Update #2: Scratch that. I still wish the blacks were darker, but this is as good as it gets on an IPS panel. OLED TVs aren't meant to be used as PC monitors, and if you use one that way, there will inevitably be burn in. I'm still quite happy with the purchase, despite the one, single, occasional stuck sub-pixel.<br/><br/>I've seen a few reviews here that fault the hardware calibration, but for me it has been superb -- certainly better, to my untrained eye, than the i1 Display Pro Plus's software calibration. That being said, I encountered a couple of bugs/problems when using the Palette Master software: it didn't detect my calibrator until I set colors to 10 bit, full output, and I had to plug it into a USB port on my desktop, not one of the SW321C's USB ports.<br/><br/>Update #3: The stuck pixel started to occur more frequently, so I contacted BenQ customer service and asked them to service the screen. The customer-support staff, who were phenomenal -- prompt, professional, understanding, knowledgeable, and incredibly to work with -- helped me, despite a couple of mix ups (which weren't their fault), resolve the matter to my satisfaction.<br/><br/>Update #4: The top review is... awful. What on earth sort of person brags(?) about bossing around delivery people? The top item in this person's list of pros is "high Quality Display Monitor," but the review also states that the screen was defective, that s/he has seen better image quality on $200 monitors, and that the colors look "horrible." Garbage. Neither of us is an expert. Ignore amazon reviews. Read reviews written by professional photographers, for whom this monitor is intended.</span>

<span>THE SHORT<br/>Good general everyday working monitor for anyone doing casual visual creative work where you need decent display quality with 4k capabilities. Love the sturdy build, easy-to-adjust height. Not the best in color accuracy (Delta E &lt; 3) and contrast/details in tonal ranges. Not the brightest monitor.<br/><br/>WHY I PURCHASED<br/>I am a full-time commercial photographer and filmmaker. Display quality and color accuracy are what I look for in my monitors. I purchased this monitor strictly for work to give me a larger screen when I edit vs. the 16" screen on my Macbook Pro.<br/><br/>DISPLAY INTEGRITY / COLOR<br/>- Contrast ratio on this monitor is decent at 1300:1, but not as high compared to the screen on my 16" macbook pro, which pushes a 1,000,000:1 for XDR content. Not docking points for this, but it is an important spec to note if you are expecting to use this as a main display for commercial visual creative work.<br/>- Not as bright as I'd like, coming in at 350 nits, compared to my macbook display which is 500 nits. Something to be aware of depending on the ambient lighting conditions of your work environment.<br/>- Color accuracy is rated at Delta E &lt; 3, which means color differences are perceptible at a glance. For professional creative work where color accuracy is a requirement, you're better off looking for a monitor with a Delta E value of &lt; 2 or lower.<br/><br/>BUILD QUALITY<br/>- The stand is sturdy and was super easy to setup; I was up and running within minutes of getting the monitor<br/>- Compared to the stand on one of my other monitors (LG 32QN600), this monitor does not wiggle and sits very stable on my desk<br/>- Height adjusts smoothly and securely, love this feature<br/>- I did notice that the corners of this screen appear to be peeling for some reason (see attached pictures). There was a sticker that came with the monitor when I unpacked it that said "DO NOT TEAR. It's normal for your monitor", which seems strange to me. I can't say that I've ever owned a monitor int he past that says a peeling adhesive in the corners is supposed to be normal. It has not proven to be an issue for now, as it is located in the black edge of the screen, though TBD whether it will continue to worsen over time.<br/><br/>PRICE<br/>- Honestly, it's a decently priced for the quality of this monitor. It's a good everyday work monitor for casual creative work, although I would not rely on it as my main display for any serious visual work.<br/><br/>VERDICT<br/>- Great purchase if you just need a mid-range 4k monitor with decent display integrity<br/>- Not the right move as your main display for any serious visual creative work, such as commercial photography or video editing, where you need to rely on higher quality display and better color accuracy</span>

<span>The PD3220U is ideal for digital work, as BenQ is notably silent on its Adobe RGB performance but boasts its P3 performance. It's also an improved monitor over the PD3200U. It may lack variable refresh rates making it not gaming-focused.  Outside that particular omission, it has just about everything else you'd want: puck adjuster for controls, USB3.1c, KVM switch, multiple inputs, ability to hot-swap color profiles, and even display profiles two at once.<br/><br/>It's relatively performant, besting the other displays at this size. The best comparison of the displays I tried was a Dell U3219Q when I purchased it was $850, but now it is roughly half the price. In pretty much every measurable way, the BenQ is a better display (sans perhaps cost-to-performance).<br/><br/>It works great my MacBook Pro and Mac Pro (although under 10.13.6 with an NVidia GPU, it was registering as a 6k display, whereas my AMD Vega 56 reported it correctly). The only real complaints are the viewing angle could be a hair wider, but at the size, this is always going to be the cause.  Color shift is pretty minimal. The finish can be mildly glare reflective in direct sunlight as its not a full matte. There's the smallest of edge shadow due to the ultra-thin bezel at the bottom edge, least pronounced of the four 32 inch 4k displays I've tried.  The black uniformity is the best I've ever seen in a 32-inch display, which is just flatly ok. When the monitor is totally dark, you can see a bit of unevenness. Also, there are no backlighting zones. It gets dark; it's not like my aging plasma screen's ability to produce deep blacks. As a daily driver, though, this is an excellent display and better than most. The wide gamut is especially felt when working with Adobe RGB profiled images and RAW photos. The P3 covers Rec BT 709 (very similar to sRGB) but lacks in the greens compared to Rec BT2020, which is well beyond any current displays sans very expensive high-end color grading displays.<br/><br/>Embracing P3 as the wide gamut standard, which covers roughly 45% of the colors the human eye can see (it's nowhere near Rec BT2020 covers 75%), is a good move as it is similar to Adobe RGB in colors covered. Basically, downloading test 10bit vs. 8bit footage is notable as gradient banding pretty much nonexistent whereas 8 bit footage you can see the banding.<br/><br/>I don't live or die by color accuracy, but it is nice when doing UI work.<br/><br/>There's also a few eye-strain technologies tossed in, do they work? Unsure doesn't seem to affect my eyes.  Also, the charging isn't quite enough for the 15 inch MacBook.<br/><br/>Lastly, the UI for a display is well above average. There are two quick profile color swaps, and brightness is super easy to adjust.<br/><br/>Pros:<br/>True 10 bit, not FRC.<br/>Wide color gamut and covers 96% of P3<br/>Easy to use UI and fast<br/>Multicolor profiles come included<br/>Didn't need to set up any color adjustments<br/>Despite the wide amount of features, sanely implemented<br/>Very low color shift.<br/>Fantastic pre-calibration.<br/>USB 3.1c<br/>More inputs than I'll ever need.<br/>Colorwise matches my MacBook 2017<br/><br/>The so-so:<br/>Matte isn't totally light sheeting.<br/>Viewing angles are pretty good but shy of smaller displays.<br/>Wattage is a bit low for 15 inch MacBooks running CPU intensive tasks, meaning still probably gotta use a power cable.<br/>GeForce 1060 thought the display was 6k under MacOS 10.13.6.<br/>No FRC, but MacOS doesn't support it.<br/>Slim bevels.<br/>Stand works nicely, no buttons or levels.<br/><br/>Bad:<br/>Backlighting could be more uniform<br/>Blacks look really good but still not as dark as my old plasma TV<br/>Somewhat pricey<br/>Internal speakers aren't any better than a Macbook's. Why bother?<br/><br/>Wishlist:<br/>I wish this was 5k or 6k; the size is fantastic.<br/>60+ Hz would be nice.<br/>Zoned backlighting for larger light/dark<br/><br/>/edit update:<br/><br/>Well covid hit and now this my main work display, and because of its input switching and ability to charge my laptop, has become even more valuable. I have a Thunderbolt 3 dock but this effectively eliminates the need. One cable connects me to my speakers, two displays and speakers, which are shared with my 2010 Mac Pro.</span>

<span>TL;DR: Great looking monitor. Big stand, tends to wiggle, monitor hum inconducive to audio work<br/><br/>I originally bought this to replace an aging 30" Apple Cinema Display in my home project studio. I mainly work with audio and the occasional image/video edit. Out of the box, this thing is pretty great. The image is nice and clear, the screen real estate is definitely a positive, I like the integrated USB hub (one less thing on my desk), and the included puck is actually pretty handy. Overall, it's a great monitor, but there are a few things others should know prior to purchasing:<br/><br/>1. The base of the stand is a lot bigger than I expected. Granted, that's on me for not completely researching all of the specs prior to purchasing. The dimensions are 11 3/16" deep by 15 1/2" wide. With the monitor in its most perpendicular position, this puts the front of the monitor roughly 7" from the back of your desk. It's a bit closer to my seated position than I would like, but it's something to keep in mind for those with limited desk space.<br/><br/>2. Given the size of the base, I'd expect this thing to be rock solid. Unfortunately, the monitor does wiggle when typing on my keyboard. I tried to narrow down what would be the culprit here, and I think it's the Vesa mount position that connects to the back of the monitor. Maybe if I had a solid wooden desk it wouldn't be an issue, but I'm using one of those Z-Line Cyprus glass top desks. Not a huge issue, but can be distracting.<br/><br/>3. The biggest issue, and the reason why I decided to return it for something else, is the noise this thing makes. The monitor emits a humming noise when receiving any video signal. I tried HDMI, DisplayPort, and even DVI, but the noise is still there. It sounds like a small engine or fan constantly running. I saw another reviewer mention this, and now I can't un-notice it. To get audio-nerd on you for a moment, I pulled out my SPL meter and measured the noise at 45 dBSPL, C-Weighted, Slow. That doesn't sound like much, but when you're listening at low levels, you can certainly hear the humming from the monitor. Such a bummer, because otherwise this monitor is awesome. If you're not using this monitor in a critical-listening environment it probably won't bother you.<br/><br/>All-in-all, it's a great looking monitor with only a few cons. I really wanted to like this monitor, but ultimately the humming is just too much to deal with in my situation.</span>

<span>UPDATE NOV 13 2019 - Viewsonic issued an updated version of the Colorbration + software that does support Datacolor Spyder 5 and X color sensors. I was finally able to use hardware calibration. Monitor does not quite meet the specs in the darkest red and black colors but it is pretty close. A reasonable choice if you want good color control for under $1,000.  I only went to 4 stars because it took customer service nearly 4 weeks to resolve the calibration issue............................The rest of the color space is excellent.  I measured 97% od adobe RGB after calibration.  Uniformity was not perfect but also reasonable. I've had this monitor for more than two weeks. Overall image quality is fine and there were no problems connecting with my desktop computer. I use this monitor for photo editing, so color calibration was critical. The documentation on-line and with the monitor is essentially useless.  Monitor has push button presets for adobe RGB, sRGB, custom and some others plus three undocumented buttons for  calibration labeled Cal 1 2 and 3. Tech support has been unable to tell me how this works. They say they have to get the information from their corporate tech support in Asia. after a week, no response.  The have calibration software called calibration+ which says in its documentation that it can be used with a number of third party sensors, including the i1 Display Studio.  It doesn't.  Tech support says I will have to buy their rebraded sensor to get it to work. In an answer above, they say that it will work with an 1i Display Pro. Again, different information  from different places in Viewsonic.  Next was told I should spend $300 and buy their sensor and use the main Colorbration software.  I asked if the main Colorbration software was meabnt to work with the Viewsonic rebraded sensor, what was the separate Colorbration + software for if it was only useable with the same rebranded sensor. No answer to that.  So I have what appears to be a reasonable monitor with OK color management but I can't take advantage of the monitor internal look up tables for calibration and can only use a thiord party sensor to calibrate the less capable LUT in my graphics card.  I can't get an answer to how using a calibration using the graphic cards LUT based on a third party sensor and software effects the preset settings.  I am happy with the hardware, disatisfied with the calibration options and appalled by the inability to provide meaningful technical support. I would not recommend this monitor unless some of this is resolved.</span>

<span>First review:<br/><br/>I always thoroughly check anything I buy with a screen for dead pixels, backlight bleed, dust, and scratches.<br/><br/>My monitor came with some sort of dust deep in the display. There are two pieces in the top of my screen. There is also a very soft, yet high-frequency hum that emits from the monitor when powering on for the first few minutes, almost like an old TV.<br/><br/>For nearly $900, there shouldn’t be any defects whatsoever.<br/><br/>I will say the image quality is nice with excellent color reproduction and clarity.<br/><br/>— UPDATE —<br/><br/>Second Review:<br/><br/>Woah! This monitor is great! It comes packaged very well, with plenty of safeguards in the box (foam and soft foam sheets) to prevent damage. Neither monitor I tried came scratched from the factory.<br/><br/>The stand is... cheap. The monitor does not simply click to the stand like the majority of monitors out there. Instead, it latches on to two small metal prongs, and you have to screw the monitor to its mount, similarly to a generic VESA mounted monitor riser. Hope you like plastic everything.<br/><br/>I barely notice any light bleed on these units. Any LCD LED-driven edge-lit monitor is going to have some, but the light bleed is incredibly minimal. I’m very picky about this.<br/><br/>I inspected this unit for dust and dead pixels on several different colored plain backgrounds, and luckily I did not find any upon initial observation!<br/><br/>As for color accuracy, it is simply stunning. I do not have a colorimeter on hand, but I can definitely attest to the vividness and accuracy against color calibration digital materials. It seems really good here.<br/><br/>It is simply magic to have a MacBook Pro hooked up to this monitor with all of your peripherals going to the USB 3.0 ports on the back of the monitor, and be able to charge and transfer data to your MacBook. I use a 15” i9 32gb Radeon Vega 20 MacBook Pro, and the monitor always pushed out enough power to never have the battery dip past 100% while video editing, so it seems to be capable of pushing out 87w. My only wish is for a headphone jack. The monitor already functions like a great USB-C hub, so why did they not include this?<br/><br/>I researched and tested many monitors before deciding on this one. With the feature set this monitor offers, there is simply no better value. Hands down, this is simply the best monitor I have had the pleasure of using below $999.<br/><br/>However, due to the fact I received a unit with 2 fairly large pieces of dust in the display, I cannot give this monitor a perfect rating. The hassle of re-packaging a defective unit is a nuisance to what could have been a perfect experience.</span>

<span> Been using this monitor for my PC and M1 MacBook and it worked like a charm... for a year. Screen suddenly started to flicker. I just contacted customer service and am waiting on their response, but here's what I did to troubleshoot it:<br/><br/>1. Restarted computer. Still flickering.<br/>2. Plugged USB-C into another port on the computer. Still flickering.<br/>3. Plugged USB-C into another MacBook. Still flickering.<br/>4. Replaced USB-C cable. Still flickering.<br/>5. Plugged in an HDMI cable to the MacBook. No flickering.<br/>6. Plugged in a DisplayPort cable to my PC. No flickering.<br/><br/>The problem seems to be a faulty USB-C port on the monitor. Just hope I can get a new one and that the warranty hasn't ended. Would be a waste to have spent so much on this display to have it crap out on me within the first year.<br/><br/>1 week later update: customer service reached out to me and we quickly worked out a solution. I pasted everything I wrote above, and they concluded it’s a USB-C input malfunction and they requested I ship them the monitor to be repaired. I’m impressed at their prompt responses, so customer service gets 5 stars. Overall I give the monitor 4 stars for the flickering in the first place.<br/><br/>TL;DR: This monitor is good for the new M1 macs (I have a 2021 MacBook with the M1 Max chip), and the customer service is stellar if you ever run into any problems.</span>

<span>The monitor itself is great - the panel is excellent and delivers on its promises. After calibration, it color matches my BenQ SW2700PTs perfectly in AdobeRGB mode. It has a variety of input plugs and acts as a USB hub which is useful.<br/><br/>The reason I am giving this 4 stars instead of 5 is because ViewSonic's Colorbration tool is garbage. You have to use this tool to save the calibration profiles into the monitor hardware (as opposed to using a software profile), so there is no other choice. When it works, it works -- but I had to run it about 25 times before it would work. Most of the time, it would *almost* calibrate, but one narrow range of colors (and not the same colors every time) would be WILDLY off, for example, some blues may become clipped cyan, rendering the result absolutely useless.<br/><br/>Eventually I got it to work and hopefully I won't have to touch the calibrator again for a long long time...</span>

<span>I have tried three different 4k monitors and this one is hands down the only "usable one" (probably the best under $400).

<span>I just moved from a retina iMac to a Mac Studio and was looking for a monitor that was as good as the retina in the iMac. First off, nothing is as good as the retina iMac screen except the new $1,500 Apple monitor. But, this LG gets you 99% of the way there. It takes a little fiddling to get the resolution right but after working with it a couple of weeks, I can't tell the difference between this monitor and the iMac when writing code - working with text. No idea about games or professional graphics. As far as casual watching YouTube and web browsing it's every bit as good as the retina iMacs.<br/><br/>I liked it so much, I got a 2nd one to connect to the Mac Studio replacing an older 27" Apple Thunderbolt display. The monitor works great out of the box with the included USB-C cable. I now have 2 connected via the USB-C cables and they are great. Probably the only downside is the built in speaker. It's no where near what the iMac's speakers sound like. To solve that one, I found a Nylavee sound bar and it fits snugly under the monitor. One other issue I have not solved yet and it could be self inflicted is the computer sometimes will not go to sleep from the sleep menu the first try. Another issue is open apps don't always stay on the 2nd monitor when the computer wakes up. This is a known problem when using non Apple displays so it might have to be something to live with until Apple has time to stop making new emojis and fix a few bugs in their software.<br/><br/>Now I'm back to what I had with the iMac, except now I have 10 cores and blazing speed.</span>

<span>Great color and clarity. Connects quickly and easily with my M1 Max Macbook Pro. I knocked off one star because the included USB C cable is pretty short and the monitor doesn't work with anything but the included cables. I tried 2 different USB C cables from Apple and a generic one and neither worked. I called LG and they said they don't make a longer one and that is the only one that works with the monitor. I use 2 of these monitors with my laptop so a longer cable would make it much more convenient to connect the one that's furthest away from the computer.</span>

<span>As of March 2022 the monitor is shipping with outdated firwmare which does not support USB C connections.  If you do not have an HDMI or Displayport computer actively displaying content it is almost impossible to get to the menus.<br/><br/>You can fix this with a firmware update wich will require a usb stick drive.  I cannot put links here but searching for<br/><br/>Then, potentially update the HUB PD FW.  I ended up not doing so, not because I did not want to but because it requires a windows computer to run the .exe.  Asus support says it is not needed for macintosh but I have seen some weirdness where the ports do not seem to be getting power so I may try it and report back.<br/><br/>The page for this troubleshooting at ASUS is pointing to an older version of the firmware so, in my case, I did it twice.<br/><br/>Once all that is done, we are at the place the device should have been to write a review.<br/><br/>Pro's:<br/>- Screen is beautiful - significantly better then the LG I returned.<br/>- Option to decrease the blue output with a few clicks is very nice<br/>- Ability to add shortcuts (eg. volume up and down, brightness) to one click button on the front is very nice<br/>- LOTS of usb connections<br/>- solidly built<br/><br/>Cons (excluding the set up pain above-3 hours of my life I will never recover):<br/>- unclear if there is a seperate upgrade for the USB Hub- if so it appears to be a windows exe.<br/>- support is ok, but auality is technician specific<br/>- the built in speakers - the 1950's called, they want their am radio back.</span>

<span>I had to replace my 27" iMac with a new Mini. Since there was no way I was going to spend the kind of. cash Apple wants for their monitors, I was on the hunt. I had a 27" iMac for about 10 years, so it took a few weeks for my eyes to adjust to this matte screen. If you're a designer or photographer then you may love this monitor. The colors are really close and it's easy on the eyes.<br/><br/> Cons:  The monitor sleeps and moving the mouse won't wake it up with a Mac mini. You have to push the power button. It's a  small complaint, but it's annoying. Also, the "speaker" is complete garbage. I have speakers, so it doesn't matter for me, but if you want a decent sound with a monitor then this isn't for you.</span>

<span>We bought two and they are beautiful monitors. Out of the box they are extremely color accurate and my calibrator have very little work to do. My only complaint is that the mechanism that connects the monitors to the base is very flimsy. They are constantly bobbing around on my desk like bobble heads, with just minimal movement like typing or moving my hand from my keyboard to mouse. It's very annoying. If they were more stable, 5 stars all the way.</span>

<span>This review is for the ASUS ProArt Display 32” 4K (3840 x 2160) HDR monitor, model PA329CV.  After purchasing two, replacing a pair of HP Pavilion 32" 2K monitors, the packaging alone impressed me.  Upon unpacking the monitors, I was equally impressed by the very hefty, well-made monitor base and the post that the monitor attaches to.  My last monitor purchase (the Samsung UR59 4K curved monitor) was a complete disaster, very light plastics, and chintzy feeling, so actually feeling the quality of the Asus ProArt display - and you can feel the quality - was notable to me and worth mentioning. Connecting the base to the back of the monitor was very easy. I found it best to stand and turn the base around so that I could see the backside of the monitor as I aligned the male to female connectors on the base.  After attaching the display to its base, this is when I realized that not only could I adjust the height (which I already knew), but I could also swivel the monitor left to right. BUT that’s not all! I could also rotate the display 90-degrees, turning it into a vertical display. Wow! I always wanted a vertical display for coding. You only see features like these in more expensive monitors, so that sort of blew my mind. Connecting the power cord and the DisplayPort cable was effortless, although I did find it helpful to use a hand mirror to assist me, because the ports are tucked underneath the backside of the cover. But it wasn't too hard.  Upon connecting the monitors to my computer, I had to manually flip the power switch located next to the power cable input on the rear side.  Once I did that and pressed the front-side power button, the Asus logo animation was kind of neat to see and out-of-the-box, I could tell that the displays had been color corrected. I am using these Asus ProArt monitors in my work as a graphic artist, video editor, 3D modeler, and my work in film.  So, color correction is a necessary step in my creative process.  I have a color meter and plan on testing the accuracy of the Calman verification, but having been through this process in the past, I am confident that they've been calibrated, and BOTH MONITORS look identical, in case others considering using these for creative work are wondering.  Note: because LED monitors are made in batches, sometimes a monitor from a different batch can have a slight color temperature difference. But not these. They're identical. I also really love that the power and menu buttons are on the front-side of the display’s bezel. They remain unlit, so if you work in a dark environment, like me, there’s no distraction from annoying LED lights. Another note on brightness. At the onset, I thought I was going to need to adjust the display’s brightness, but after using them for a few minutes, my eyes adjusted nicely, so I think the brightness is just fine out-of-the-box.  My last pair of monitors were a bit jacked up in brightness, so I think that's what my eyes were responding to.  That's why I only gave it 4 stars in the brightness department.  Truthfully, I am still testing them. But I honestly do believe that anyone, especially a digital artist like me, will feel and see the quality in these monitors, and the price is well worth it especially considering that the ASUS ProArt Display 32” 4K PA329CV displays rival the BenQ monitors I've used in the past, and for over $200 less! Come on. Give them a try.</span>

<span>[Update] 4 stays to 3. I cannot recommend the monitor anyone who expects to use DisplayPort with this monitor. There is too many issues related to it. It leaves the backlight on even when in standby (I believe it's still scanning for a input when it does this). On wake, it moves all windows/icons from 2nd monitor to this one because for a split second it thinks it's the only monitor. Google this issue, multiple people report it. Only workaround is to use HDMI. Which isn't so bad if it weren't for the flashing blue screen mentioned previously.<br/><br/>[Update] 5 stars to 4 stars because of an issue with using DisplayPort. Sometimes you won't see POST or any kind of start up, and just stare at a black screen until a desktop environment is detected. Switch to HDMI to solve. But HDMI has a blue screen for no signal for some reason. So you will see a flash of obnoxious blue on boot,wake,shutdown.<br/><br/>This monitor (PA278QV) is extensively reviewed and recommended by review sites.<br/><br/>I bought it as a primary monitor replacement to a 27" 4k IPS 60hz monitor.<br/><br/>[Resolution]<br/>Off the bat, going from 4k resolution to this 1440 is a downgrade. Text and some icons are obviously more pixelated. It's noticeable but it doesn't bother me as much as I thought it would. I don't see any noticeable difference when playing videos, not enough at least to distract you from just enjoying a tv show or movie.<br/><br/>[Color]<br/>The color on this monitor is very good. I'm not an expert at all, but it definitely does feel calibrated very well. Maybe it's a touch too saturated, but really it doesn't need too much fiddling. Compare to my other 4k monitor I had to fiddle with it, but it did produce similar results but the colors are just not as deep.<br/><br/>[Backlight &amp; Uniformity &amp; Viewing angles]<br/>There is some backlight bleed on mine; it is acceptable (I've seen worse). The grey,white uniformity (how consistent it is across the screen) is pretty good. The color uniformity and viewing angles (that is, colors can be slightly different depending on where it is on the screen or what angle you're looking at) is very good, which is impressive.<br/><br/>[75hz &amp; Gaming]<br/>Outside of gaming I didn't think the jump from 60hz to 75hz would matter, but it kind of does. For me it's noticeable, things on the screen transition much smoother. It makes the desktop experience more easy on the eyes. But I get that some people won't notice any difference.<br/><br/>As for gaming, the same can be true. It is a much better experience on 75hz. I don't understand this other review that heavily criticized it for it's gaming functionality. If you're looking at this monitor chances are you're primarily looking to get things done, and sometimes want to kick back and play some games. There are much better monitors if the goal is competitive gaming. But if you're playing more casual games, the 75hz and 5ms response time is more than fine (there are tradeoffs) and getting a great picture &amp; color is a good trade if you're not only wanting to play games.<br/><br/>[OSD &amp; other things]<br/>The On Screen Display is a bit cumbersome at first to work through, but once you get use to it you'll appreciate the amount of options you have. There is even a blue light filtering option, and 2 customizable modes. And one of my favorites, a quick shortcut option which will allow you to switch between those 2 modes.<br/><br/>The monitor does not come with a displayport cable (it ships with a hdmi cable).  The ports on the monitor are on the underside of the monitor instead of on the back. The edges of the monitors aren't thin enough to brag as a feature, but it's reasonably thin and that's a nice touch. Don't like the Silver Asus logo, slightly distracting.</span>

<span>So far, this monitor seems to be very nice. Not the highest resolution, but I didn't want a 4k and those make text on my Mac very small and hard to read. My only dislike is the "ruler" at the bottom of the screen. It's useless and out of place where the rest of the screen's bezel is fairly thin.</span>

<span>This was my 3rd BenQ monitor.  I like that it is almost bezel-free, has a very clean look, and very high-quality feel, the picture quality was amazing and easy on the eyes.  The only thing is I was looking to connect it to my Roku 3 in a smaller room and although it worked great, this is a monitor with no IR support, so one can't turn this on and off or control the volume with a Roku remote.  Pushing buttons under the monitor to navigate menus can be a bit cumbersome. BenQ does make a bigger monitor with IR and remote, however, I didn't want to test that out since I had limited space for what I was trying to set up.  I ended up returning the monitor and getting a small TV instead, however as a monitor I would highly recommend it!</span>

<span>Running LINUX UBUNTU 20.04 and 22.04 Added as a second screen replacing a 24" monitor.<br/><br/>The good part:<br/>It worked right out of the box. "Boots" up quickly. Nice sharp display good colors.<br/>The stand snaps together without needing any tools.<br/>The menu is easy to navigate and offers a nice set of options.<br/>It has built in speakers that can be controlled by the menu options.<br/>It has the standard display input ports. (HDMI, DVI, VGA).<br/><br/>The  cons:<br/>The stand is not adjustable. I will probably get a monitor arm.<br/>The monitor is a bit wobbly with the supplied stand.<br/>It has a fairly bright power button light. I will end up covering it with a piece of tape or something.<br/><br/>Summary:<br/>For the price class (~$170 US) it is a decent monitor and would be good as a single or second display.</span>

<span>I needed a curved screen, but there are not a lot of options for these in the market anymore. That's a shame because curve screens are helpful for a field of view and maximizing space on the desk. In any case, I needed a curve screen in 32 in, or I would have to go down to a 27-in flat screen. This is for my second monitor. Where I would keep a discord window, web browser, etc. open. While working, I use the second screen for my thumbnail picture viewer, and my main screen (also 4K) is split in half between a composition window and usually a Kindle or web browser.<br/><br/>For my purposes, this monitor is perfect. I cannot speak to its gaming performance at all, and I'm not terribly concerned about color fidelity, nor am I a good judge of such things, but I am very satisfied with the picture quality.<br/><br/>The second major requirement for a monitor was that it switched inputs effectively. I was replacing a flat screen 32-in Samsung that was having difficulty recognizing new inputs even when there was only one active input. This screen accurately and quickly picks up the active input, either display port or HDMI, quickly and consistently. This is not a function of the graphics card as many troubleshooting recommendations suggest, because the only factor that has changed was the monitor itself.<br/><br/>Lastly, the controls for the monitor are located beneath the screen not on the side and not on the back. This is extremely important if you're using a second monitor because so many of these things come with controls on the back of the monitor! This makes them inaccessible for side by side screens! There is no such problem when the controls are beneath the screen rather than on the side or the back. So that was another major upgrade from the Samsung.<br/><br/>My only criticisms, thus far, is that this end almost every other monitor I've looked at only come with one display port and usually two HDMI ports. These are computer screens. DisplayPort is the computer screen standard. My graphics cards have three display ports and only one native HDMI port. That's because their computers, not TVs. Thus I would like to see multiple display ports and only one HDMI for legacy compatibility. Instead, 90% of the monitors on the market are the opposite.<br/><br/>Secondly, the port on the back of the monitor stick out at 90° angles. Thus requiring more space to accommodate HDMI display port and power cables. They should be flush with the monitor plugged into a female port facing down. I'm not sure what the decision making process was for this design, but I generally dislike monitors with cables that stick out at 90° angles. Although, they are always easier to plug in if space is not a concern.</span>

<span>I am using this monitor as I type this review.<br/><br/>I love this screen! I don't game, I use it for work and streaming, but the picture is amazing. This is my first curve monitor and I smitten. The install and setup were straightforward and easy. I use this as a secondary screen to multitask with my laptop.<br/><br/>The screen size is amazing to have multiple documents/windows/apps open on and working seamlessly back and forth.<br/><br/>I also use this to stream video content and the HD picture is ::chef's kiss::, I have no complaints about this monitor which is amazing and does what I need. Price was a little high for what I am using it for, but you INSTANTLY see where the money went and I am not mad it at.</span>

<span>I love this monitor! It's far, far better than the one provided to me by my employer at my office. I now prefer to WFH, mostly because of this monitor.<br/>I can easily place several Word documents side-by-side, and see all text clearly. The sharpness is perfectly paired with a light shift in my MacBook Pro that changes the temperature based on the room light and time of day. (This is because I keep the MBPs' screen open as a second monitor. YMMV if you close the laptop, and just use this as your sole monitor.)</span>

<span>I purchased to do remote work because I need to be able to view a lot of systems at once. The monitor is large enough and with the On Screen Control built in (you will need to download the app on the LG website to access it) the ability to have the screen choose an option of auto placing the different applications I am using, equally, on the screen and still be able to still maintain another application on my laptop screen ... so in essence allowing me to view 4 different applications at once, in large enough scale, to be useful. It allows me to increase my multitasking ability &amp; to quickly switch between applications. The price is phenomenal, under $200. It is economical enough that an average individual can afford. I know I nor many, can afford a $300 , $400 or $500 monitor. The On Screen application can display many more applications than the three I use... I can see how these options for smaller views would be useful for someone that needs more of a thumbnail view which they can quickly click and display from.</span>
