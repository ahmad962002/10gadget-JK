<blockquote><em><div class="a-row a-spacing-small review-data"><span class="a-size-base review-text review-text-content" data-hook="review-body">
<span>UPDATED September 18, 2020 - I’ve replaced the images with better examples.  The first two are of a mirror in an allegedly haunted and abandoned house.  One is infrared and the other full spectrum.  Notice in the infrared shot the wood grain in the mirror’s frame and how much of that detail is lost to full spectrum.  Also look at the many lens flares.  The next two compares both methods on a staircase in a completely dark house—I could not see my hand in front of me.  The last is a full spectrum image from a professional camera.  Notice the crisp detail in the leaves.  This is how full spectrum should look.<br/><br/>UPDATED June 24, 2019 - After using this camera for several months I am changing my recommendation to DO NOT BUY!  New information has been added throughout this review in brackets.  [I recommend instead any of the Sony night vision cameras that run from $210-$1k.  Sony - Handycam CX405 Flash Memory Camcorder - Black]<br/><br/>This Zohulu camera comes in a variety of names and custom configurations for different sellers.  I liked this particular bundle because it came with two SDHC chips, a great little IR flashlight [which we discovered does not come with batteries or a charger], and a Macro lens that some others didn't have [the macro lens blocks the built in IR light].  You should check around for the bundle that meets your needs.  The names can be Ancter, Zohulu, or even Cleveland Paranormal.  The main brand is Zohulu, a trademark of  ShenZhen PuFeiSi Electronics Co.  I spent a lot of time in China looking at digital video systems for security and was very impressed with the Chinese brands of night vision security systems. [In our testing my partner bought a different model, the Ancter and for some reason, it performs better than this one, although it appears to be essentially the same.]<br/><br/>AFFORDABILITY - The main struggle with any hobbyist "Ghost Hunter" is money.  We do this hobby for the love of the sport and we don't do it for money.  For every millionaire plumber doing this, there are tens of thousands of us struggling to pay our bills,  So when I evaluate equipment I hold the "value for the money" as the single most important feature.  This camera was made for Paranormal work which is what [I thought was]  so sweet about it.  I can film an abandoned house, switch on the spot to Infrared or with a couple of menu clicks get to the Full Spectrum feature.  [I have since learned that full spectrum is a gimmick.  If you have an object in focus, then you change the lighting type your object will need to be refocused because the focal point is based on the wavelength of the light.  Because ultraviolet is much shorter wavelength than infrared, it is a physical impossibility for a full spectrum shot to be totally in focus.  It will always look a little fuzzy.  Plus, infrared is a stronger wavelength that tends to wash out the ultraviolet.  There is no hard evidence that full spectrum provides any advantage in ghost hunting. People will show you evidence and claim that is their proof of the value of full spectrum, but the image was most likely made with infrared light and tinted purple by ultraviolet.  It would have been more clear in pure infrared]<br/><br/>I can connect to the camera with my phone and while I leave one downstairs guarding the front door I can watch it on my phone while I'm upstairs.  I can review the footage using the camera LCD screen or my iPhone, then easily download it on the spot to my iPhone.  Because I am one of those Apple techies, I have the full Apple entourage -  a Mac Pro, iPod, and iPad at home.  By the time I get home, all my footage has been downloaded to the Mac and to my iPad and iPod automatically.  It's inexpensive, it gets the job done [poorly], and it is very well affordable!<br/><br/>LENS IMPERFECTIONS - Now for the rest - I am an actor and a cinematographer, I have had films play at SXSW, Tribeca, and Cannes.  My favorite camera is my Blackmagic Cinema Camera.  Nothing beats it for Mirror Images Phenomenon.  Because it records in raw, uncompressed digital negatives, I can adjust all my white balance, ISO, etc at the computer just as if I am still at the mirror with my camera.  That camera was $2,000 for the body and $1,000 for the Canon lens.  This paranormal camera was $200 for everything.  We have to keep that in mind at all points in the review.  I only have the Blackmagic because I was filming customer commercials with it.  I couldn't afford it otherwise so I was lucky.  It doesn't handle infrared so it requires visible light - a real downer for paranormal work.  This paranormal camera actually has three lenses.  It has the standard lens with an average field of view.  It also comes with a Macro lens for super closeup work which is fantastic.  Then you add yet another lens on top of that Macro lens to come up with their Ultra-Wide lens configuration.  The result is horrific lens flares.  See my two pictures.  Lens flares are the result of imperfections in the lens glass - round objects will take on a hexagon shape when they get a little out of focus.  This is the lens inability to handle out-of-focus light.  I'd say those shots above look fantastic for a cinematic choice, but are a disaster for paranormal work.  Determining which anomalies are paranormal and which are lens problems can be quite difficult.  [after shooting a variety of investigations using other infrared and cinema cameras, I don't bring this one along anymore.  The lens problems are extreme.]  So I only shoot now with the standard lens which cleans up most but not all of the flares.  They make a distinction in their manual that the image is not an infrared image.  It has an internal infrared light (which the ultra-wide lens blocks by the way) and pushing the IR button on the back of the camera automatically switches off the infrared filters and turns on the light.  The camera looks at the scene and then recreates a black and white image to represent it.  At least, that's the way the manual is written.  It's an interesting read because the English is very good in the beginning but it looks like the interpreter got tired as she/he worked through the manual.  The English started getting worse and by the time it got to the Full Spectrum explanation at the end it was almost unreadable.  So it's possible it was a poor translation but the camera doesn't have the traditional greenish hue of night vision, it looks black and white.<br/><br/>FULL SPECTRUM - Full Spectrum mode adds a fuzziness or haze to the image.  The IR shots are much cleaner than the Full Spectrum.  I have tens of thousands of images from investigations with hundreds of apparitions in infrared.  I've yet to capture anything in ultra-violet.  Full Spectrum is made by merging 3 separate images - one from the near-IR range, one from the visible range, and one from the near-ultraviolet range.  That's why the image looks fuzzier, these are different focal lengths shot in one focal plane so of course it would be a little fuzzy.  I'm not convinced yet that there is any value to Full Spectrum.  IR is a snap, push a button on the back of the camera. When I’m out on a hunt being able to tap one button that turns on the infrared light and switches to black &amp; white mode is sweet.  Full Spectrum, however, requires doing that, plus going into the menu settings under ‘Color’, and changing the setting to ‘Vivid’.  So for me, I use just the single, built-in lens, and switch between visible light and IR by using the simple push button.  This also makes the internal IR light usable again as it is no longer blocked by the wide angle lens.  Additional information about full spectrum from Wikipedia says:  It is important to note that while the converted camera sensor is capable of recording in both the ultraviolet and infrared region, when mixed light hits the sensor it will be the longer infrared waves that will predominate in the recording. Little or no shortwave ultraviolet light may be recorded unless selective filtering is applied to cut some or all of the infrared light. The longwave infrared light may also wash out a considerable amount of the visible light in the blue and green areas in a full spectrum photograph. Similarly if infrared light is entirely blocked, the visible light can overwhelm the recording of the ultraviolet light. So there is no truly full-spectrum photograph that can be made [with this camera. Good full spectrum cameras exist and the standard method is to shoot the still-subject well-focused three times, with three different filters and merging the 3 images into one.  Video requires a complicated method of realtime splitting of the image 3 ways, applying the appropriate filter, then recombining before saving. $$$.  This camera has no manual focus, it is set for infinite focus.]<br/><br/>ODDITIES, RESOLUTION &amp;  FRAME RATE - This is a really strange method, there is no separate setting for frame rate.  The rates are matched to the resolution.  If you want a higher frame rate, you will have to accept a lower resolution.  If you want 4k or 3840 x 2160 you will have to accept 24 frames per second.  That's not a problem for me because that's what all my movies are shot at, but I can't match it to my iPhone's 30FPS - just let the editing software figure it out.  Another oddity is that for UHD they use the free disk archiver program "DAR" to compress the image to save chip space.  It's saved as a 4:3 video on the chip, then the DAR software uncompresses it back to 16:9 format.  However, my editing software says this clip is actually 2880 x 2160 @ 24fps.  [This probably contributes to the poor quality of the image] The next choice is QHD or 2560 x 1440 and you get this size at 30fps, no other option.  Next is FHD or 1920 x 1080 at 60fps.  That is standard HD running at 60fps.  [In bright light this seemed to produce the best possible video for this camera].  Next is HD or 1280 x 720 @ 120fps.  What?  120fps.  Crazy.  No other choice.  Historically I believe that was the first HD format that came out followed quickly by 1920x1080p.  Finally, we have VGA or 640 x 480 at 30 fps.  What?  30 fps.  That's just...weird.  It uses JPG for still images and the container is MP4 for video.  My editor says it is H.264 compression but my guess is that it's motion jpeg compressed again (barely)  by H.264 getting it into the MP4 container, that would make sense.  The two samples I provided show the first mistake I made - it's low resolution.  Evidently, it defaults to that every time, at least I haven't been able to get it to stay at HD so be sure check it before every shoot.  It does provide the recording format symbol on the LCD screen so it's easy to check.  The documentation said VGA is 640x480@30fps but my software said it was actually 640x360@30fps.  The third picture I uploaded is this UHD format but I cropped it.  I simply wanted to show the quality of the image and the fact that it is an infinite depth of field focus.  There is NO option for focus either manually or automatically.<br/><br/>FACE DETECTING FEATURE - in a poorly documented section it explains that you can enable face detecting, which I assume will then ensure a good focus on the subject.  Everything in your image will be more or less in focus, which could be a good thing I suppose for paranormal work.  It's often a problem that the key shot is out of focus.  Another poorly documented section is METERING.  I'm assuming this is how it handles light in the scene, from averaging across many samples to a single point sample, ergo, face detect.  Other than Full Spectrum looking fuzzy to me, I have no complaints about the instant focusing of this camera.  Having said that, the Zoom lever on the top of the camera is too close to the menu lever.  Trying to use your thumb to zoom your lens might accidentally kick it out of video recording mode sending it either the camera mode or menu mode.<br/><br/>AUDIO -  This is by far the worst feature of the camera.  The audio is atrocious.  It sounds like you are in a 55-gallon drum sinking to the bottom of the ocean.  It's very bad, and it can really mess up your editing too.  If you ever have trouble with things getting out of synch, look at the audio.  This is a common synch issue across all types of editors.  This camera shoots a mono signal, which I could live with but it is a bizarre 32 kHz.  CD's and DVD's are 44.1 kHz,  iPhones are 48 kHz and my best device, the Zoom H4n records uncompressed WAV files at 96khz.  So they decided to record the mono file at 1/3rd of the digital audio of my Zoom.  It's horrible.  Good EVPs don't need microphones, I've captured many EVPs in experiments with microphones totally disabled..  [But this camera will shred the EVP.].  I've recorded EVPs with the mikes completely removed, so that does work, but I don't get as many EVPs as I normally would.  I'm going to try to use an external mike, one that uses its own battery power and another that uses the camera power.  This camera, fortunately, has a working hot shoe, so many different attachments from IR lights to external shotgun mikes are possible.  I will update this review when I've done that. [I tried using different high-quality microphones, both stereo with adapter plugs for mono and mono microphones.  The quality of the microphone makes no difference because the camera shreds it to death when saving it to the chip.  I absolutely hate the audio of this camera]<br/><br/>DON’T take my word for it!  Look at the videos from other reviewers.  Blow them up to full screen and look at all the distortion, artifacts and pixelation in the video.  The compression destroys the video.  Now listen to their audio, don’t skip over it just take a quiet moment and listen to it.  It’s abysmal!<br/><br/>BATTERY - this bundle comes with two batteries, a regular capacity and a high capacity battery.  I used the high capacity battery on a recent investigation and it held up for an hour even using an external IR light on the hot shoe.  I had disabled the onboard IR light because most of it is blocked by the wide angle lens.  I'm happy that between the two batteries I should be fine.  I've learned to leave a complete set of everything, batteries, media, etc out in my car because if the entities kill the batteries in my camera, they will also kill them in my pocket.  For some reason, the ones in the car are not touched nor do they do a second attack.  I'm usually fine after reloading.<br/><br/>SUMMARY - there was a lot of negative in the last few paragraphs, for $200 this is [a terrible buy ].  By managing the issues [I still wish I would have bought one of the Sony handycams].  My final setup is this - I'm recording in UHD at 24 fps.  I'm using an external Sony microphone on the top hot shoe that does not draw power, it has it's own battery.  I disable the onboard IR light to save battery.  I have the spotlight that this bundle comes with mounted underneath the camera. [it did not come with a rechargeable battery nor did it have a charger.  I bought a kit with both for $23 off Amazon]  I also carry a Zoom recorder in my top shirt pocket to synch to the camera's audio channel.  Most of my evidence is then presented using the Zoom audio.  If I can start off in visible light I do so, but most times I'm running Infrared the entire time.  I can connect to the camera with my iPhone out in the field if needed, checking recorded evidence is a snap.  I found that once I get home, it's easier and faster to pull the chip out and stick it in my Mac for downloading.  The chip is formated in MS-DOS FAT32.<br/><br/>MAC COMPATIBILITY - Once last note about compatibility.  One reviewer said it is not supported by Apple, another reviewer said it is supported.  They are both right.  The files are standard JPG or mp4 files.  Any Mac can read them.  The SDHC Chip is formatted as MS-DOS FAT 32.  Macs can read those too and can indeed reformat them in that format.  However, while there is an app that one can use to view and download files onto your iPhone or iPad, they did not make one for an iMac.  Further, when you connect the camera to your Mac via the USB connector, it fails to connect.  The manual says it is not supported by Mac OS, only Windows or iOS devices such as iPhones.  Still, the chip works fine in the chip reader on my Mac.  I hope this helps people decide.  I hunted for years with the old fashioned Sony Nightshots with tape recorder which destroyed the audio with the tape motor, but the video was superb.  Now they are digital and are what I recommend for Ghost Hunters.</span>

<span>the camcorder/camera seemed to work decent. I did however notice that it wont zoom when resolution is set to the FHD or HD resolution types and only on 2K or 4K it will zoom in and out. the description failed to mention that there wasnt any batteries included for the flashlight attachment in which i had no idea what batteries it took. i had to research online to figure that out myself. that was really only part i disliked about it. other than that it seems operational and decent for the use of it with pretty neat features. Will test it out more here soon with my paranormal investigation coming up.</span>

<span>The Mevo Start is a great camera for live streaming or for recording.  It is good for those getting started in streaming.  It is reasonably priced and has a lot of great features.  You can live stream to most any service.  The camera can be connected via Wi-Fi or with Ethernet (requires a separate adapter).  Wi-Fi works well if you have good access points and signals.  Streaming quality will depend on your upload speeds.  Recording are saved directly to the camera but you will need get a micro-SD card as it does not come with one, but those are so affordable.  You will need an Android or iOS tablet or phone to work with the camera.  There is an app that controls and configures the camera.<br/>There is a built in microphone that works well.  You can also alternatively connect an external sound source to the Aux 3.5 mm jack.  It is configurable for Mic level input or Line level input (like sound board).  There are level controls for audio within the app.  It fits on most any tripod (standard 1/4 screw).  I found battery life to be 4-5 hours which should be good in most cases.  There is a USB-C connector on the camera that can be used for external power or ethernet adapter.  Indicator LED on the front of the camera tells you the connection status and I believe can also act as a Tally light.<br/>One of the nice features is digital zoom.  You can view what the camera sees from within the app.  The app also lets you zoom the camera view in and out.  You can also move a zoomed box around with the full field of the camera, so it almost like having PTZ.  The video feed is quite good and there are settings for things like low lighting and outdoor.<br/>Camera looks and feels well built.  There is no lens cover so you might want to get a case for it.<br/>The camera can also be configured as an NDI source and it works great with OBS, zoom and all.<br/>Good starter and can still be used in more advanced setups (like OBS).  Keep in mind that the app can only be used with one camera at a time (you can move back and forth between cameras).  A multi-cam app is being developed and is currently in Beta at this time.</span>

<span>Aside from the flaw (which I will get to), the camera is pretty awesome.  I think the most impressive part of it for me is the battery life. I wish there were a 4K option, but it's a small sacrifice given the price point.  Now, the flaw...<br/><br/>You cannot change the aspect ratio of the camera.  It is always 16:9 which means that streaming on popular platforms like TikTok and Instagram shouldn't be a thing since these apps work best using 9:16 ratio. Now, if you're ok with simply recording versus livestreaming, you can lay the camera over to achieve 9:16.  Then, during the editing process, rotate the image.  Aside from that issue, the Mevo Start is a flawless budget camera.</span>

<span>I have used several different Amazon chinese trail cameras and most have sucked. This one does not suck. Not saying its perfect - but it does get photos and enough to think that I am not missing anything. Pictures could be nicer, but they are good for sure. No audio on mine, and had one that took really short videos and couldnt change it in settings. (Only 2 seconds no matter what the settings were)<br/><br/>Other cameras have had corrupted files (files here are still in a weird format, but its okay) and most of the other cameras I had broke the season I had them.

<span>I've never owned a trail camera before so this is my first and I didn't want to go all out. I live in a big city and I've thought about a security camera before but didn't want to deal with cloud storage subscriptions etc. I'm mainly interested in what poops in and digs up my front yard so a trail cam seemed like a fun alternative that can also be moved around.<br/><br/>I've now had the camera out two nights and already caught three cats in the middle of the night. Nice. Otherwise just tested it on dog walkers, cars, the mailman. Still playing with optimal settings to reduce waste with boring recordings.<br/><br/>So far so good. Camera was easy to set up with decent instructions, albeit awkwardly phrased at times. Comes in a nice box. I like the non-strap mount and screwed it to a piece of wood I can move around in the yard. Decent features in the settings but as a newbie I have no comparison to what higher-end cameras might have.<br/><br/>Two things that are already not good:<br/>The USB cable connection does not work! While the camera does activate "connected mode", my Windows 8.1 PC will not recognize the SD card as a connected drive. Support so far told me my best option is not to use the provided cable as different computers may need different cables. What!? If anything doesn't seem to fit right it's the micro port on the camera side. Using SD card with reader adapter works fine but not preferred.<br/>The Down button has started to accidentally trigger the OK button unless I touch the very left edge of the Down button with my fingernail.<br/><br/>Assorted other:<br/>Amazon suggests as "frequently bought together" that I get a two-pack of 32GB SD cards but they are the wrong type. Beware!<br/>Some confusion/contradiction between "supports up to 256GB" and "supports less than 256GB".<br/>Windows may not support the video file format. Why not just say they are AVI files? No problem. Never heard of these other players.<br/>Product title could somehow state that this is the "A1 model". Also says 16MP but setting goes to 20MP.<br/>Concerned how much battery is already used up in the two nights (I inserted 8).<br/><br/>Wishful feature:<br/>Option to preserve the file counter between SD cards and deletes/formats or let us set an offset so that files are numbered chronologically and I don't have to deal with duplicate reused names on my PC.<br/><br/>Still considering a return or at least exchange to see if the two things above are isolated to a few bad apples. Have a still unanswered e-mail follow-up in with tech support.<br/><br/>Update March 2 to 8, 2022:<br/>Customer service contacted me with a very kind and detailed e-mail that addressed everything in my review. They are very willing to listen to suggestions and make improvements in their descriptions. They offered me a refund, or a replacement directly to my address. I chose the replacement and received a new camera the next day.<br/>The keypad is fine now. Unfortunately the USB cable connection is again not working but I've come to accept that and just plug the SD card into a PC adapter. Either method requires to pop open the camera case anyway.<br/>Battery life is not an issue I found out now as my camera is on stand-by more often. With a big enough card (I have a 128GB now but it does support 256GB) the file numbering isn't much of a concern, especially with the option to delete the oldest when full.<br/>I've received a refund for my shipping cost to return the old camera (generously not asked to return the accessories).<br/>Because of this good interaction with customer care I am upping my review from 3 to 4 stars.</span>

<span>I have used a number of camera traps over the years.  This is by far one of the best out there at this price point.  This was my first with a built in screen.  The image on the screen is of much better quality than I expected. It is great to be able to quickly check to see what I have before pulling the micro SD card to download data.  Many times I would check it and decide not to download the files that day.<br/><br/>*The screen also makes setup and selecting options easy.<br/>*Great picture and video quality in both the day and night.<br/>*So far the camera has taken ~100 high quality videos over the course of a week and the batteries are still going strong. (The option to use 4 or 8 is great).<br/>*It has withstood several rainy nights with no problem.<br/>*Having sound on the videos is great!<br/>*The included 32gb micro SD card and batteries were a great bonus.<br/>*Including temperature data is a fun addition.<br/><br/>I would highly recommend this camera trap to anybody.</span>

<span>I've been running the camera for almost 30 days WITH the solar panel battery combo.  My First impression is pretty high but there are just a few things I think can be improved upon.  First the good..<br/>Battery life: After 30 days, the 12 lithium batteries I installed are still at 100%.  This tells me that this camera will be maintenance free for a very long time!<br/>Setup: Super easy, I got the ATT version and it logged into the network in seconds from first power up.<br/>App: very easy to navigate and thing are laid out in a simple manner.<br/>-----------<br/>Improvements I would like to see<br/>On demand photo: It would be fantastic to log into the app and force a snap shot at any given time.  There is an option to set up timed photos but that not quite the same.<br/>My app randomly crashes while swiping photos in the "Gallery".  It could be my phone but it's an S22 top of the line so there a bit of work to do there.<br/>Aspect ratio:  I understand this is a "Game Camera" and it has a very WIDE angle which is great.  The problem is I'm trying to catch People on my property.  It has a fairly narrow height compared to it's width.<br/>Their photos are 16:9 and that's great, but a 4:3 I think would be a better ratio that would catch taller object like humans better.<br/>-------------<br/>I've attached two photos, one is the standard one you get immediately, and it's size is 85k, the second is the HD version you can download and it's 1.7m in size.  Huge difference, but as you can see I zoomed in and captured just a portion to show you the difference in the quality between the standard definition and the downloading the HD version.</span>

<span>Had this a little more than a week and have nothing but issues. Day1- set up was simple, reformatted my SD after SD issues and all lights went green! Went out back and hung it in the tree facing the chicken pen. I had an old Moultrie standard camera in it but was trying to catch a fox red handed and what is better than a live trail cam! Set for 3 shot burst, high sensitivity, and 0 delay, immediate notification. Ran a few test pictures while walking around, good to go. Day 1- a few pictures of me and the dog nothing else. Day 2- tons of pictures of chickens and notifications, good,  just what I needed so I knew when the fox showed up. Day 3- large breaks in picture activity. Sent the dog out and no pictures. I walked in front of it and it picked me up. Verified setting and let it go. No new pics that night. Day 4- moved to a new tree and picked up the fox at 2:30am, chicken activity all day again. Day 5,6- no pics. Moved it again tonight, 6 pictures after 20 minutes of moving around in front of the cam. All lights green, lithium batteries, test photo function works. How can I get 100 pictures of the chickens one day and none the next. We have ran several dozen camera by serval brands usually have issues with to much sensitivity. Not very happy with this purchase but will keep it as a $70 SD camera. Not worth the monthly fee especially if you are putting it far from home. We run spypoints at the farm for deer and no issues with anything from squirrels to deer. Photos are decent, field of view is very small compared to my old camera. Maybe this is only meant for large game? But why 100 chicken pics in a day if that’s the case. Would not recommend. Will update if it works better on a deer field.<br/>****UPDATE 10/16/22 **** I added 1 star, seems to be more consistent on an active trail pictures every minute with deer active in front of it. Still doesn’t pick me up every time. I walked by it and back past it 5 minutes later. Only had me going one way. Wonder what else I am missing if it doesn’t pick me up.</span>

<span>Updated review.  After live chatting with Moultrie customer service, they replaced the camera on warranty with no questions asked, also credited me for the month of service.  Have fought with this camera since day 1.  Used the suggested lithium batteries, set to upload once a day.  Flash stopped working in 2 days.  Replaced batteries, still no flash.  Purchased the Moultrie brand 12 volt battery pack thinking that might help, still nothing.  Pulled the camera, brought it home and did the IR filter reset.  Flash was working fine at home, put the camera back out on a fresh charged 12v pack and now multiple pictures last night with no flash.  I am at wits end with this junk.  Time to buy a different brand camera.</span>

<span>The camera was easy to learn how to operate, easy to install in the metal box i purchased, not easy to see in tree, takes great pictures, great customer service if you have questions, easy to see and operate on your phone as long as you have good cell strength.

<span>I love this camera for what it is,  they say its made for content creators,  the main reason i got it was it has Clean HDMI out so it works as a webcam,  it can recorded as long as you need it to without shutting off like most camera and a few other things that make it a great webcam,  some people say the camera does not zoom out wide enough.  when i use it its about a arms length away and i have no problem with the field of view as long as you get the image stabilization settings right..  use the heavier image stabilization and it crops in and you don't get that nice wide field of view so so use the middle setting for image stabilization and you dont loose that nice wide angel..<br/><br/>its surprisingly good in lower light situations and even at high iso you do not get much grain in the video,  the image quality is not quite as good as something like the Sony A6400 with a 16mm sigma lens but its just a small step down if you ask me.  get the camera settings right and change the picture profile settings to your liking and this thing looks great,  i have been using it for a few weeks now and its perfect for me, ,<br/><br/>i have a video on YouTube on how to set this up as a webcam for YouTube or twitch or what ever you may use a webcam for, if you want to find that just search for "Danny Lightning Sony ZV-1 Webcam Setup"  search for that on youtube and the video probably pops up,  I go through all the in camera settings for webcam use.  just get your self a nice capture card and the proper usb cable and change a few setting and you got a amazing looking webcame<br/><br/>ZV-1 vs regular webcam ( even the 250 dollar webcams) .  this thing blows regular webcams out of the water,  this is so much better its not even funny</span>

<span>I know that it's aimed at floggers, but for amateurs who want a small, pocketable camera with a one inch sensor, with excellent fotos and excellent video, this is the camera you will always take with you. I am 75 and too old to carry around my Nikon, Fuji, and Olympus camera and lenses. It is solid and well made. I have small hands, also, so it's perfect for me. The zoom is a bit slow, you will likely not take fotos of distant birds, nor win photo contests at your local foto club (which is dominated by heavy duty equipment) but it's absolutely perfect for me.  The ZV-1 is also packed with technology.  For example, it's Auto HDR setting alone will transform your pics, providing details lost in shadows, and is an absolute necessity for high contrast, bright sunshine days. It's ability to turn on when you open the lcd screen is another very useful feature. I could go on and on.</span>

<span>Sony came so close to making a great camera for vloggers and people on the move.  It combines a 1" sensor, Zeiss lens, and a truly fantastic focus system.  Unfortunately, without some sort of active gimbal, it is nearly impossible to hold steady enough to get acceptable footage. I originally tried the handheld stick which came with the accessory pack... it was useless... even with the SteadyShot on I was unable to hold the camera still enough to eliminate shake.<br/><br/>Notes- (please note... I am only reviewing this for its video capability)<br/><br/>- I am going to start off with the positive.  The focus system is remarkable. I absolutely love that the camera will put itself in macro mode and focus on objects in the foreground. It is also remarkably fast in focusing in making the adjustment.  This is a very useful tool for doing vlog style product features... you can record your face and then have the camera immediately (and almost magically) focus on a product that you throw in front of it. The challenge is next point)<br/><br/>- If you are doing this while holding the camera on some sort of non-active gimbal  - your footage will likey have some serious shake.  Personally, I find this to be a cardinal sin. YT and other services usually de-rank videos with shaky footage.<br/><br/>-  Of course, you can overcome the shake by 1) using a tripod 2) getting an active gimbal.  Option 1 is ok... but it kinda defeats the purpose of the super-fast focus.  So I went with #2... and I was able to find a pretty decent active gimbal that worked well. Honestly, it dropped the shake to a point that I would have expected from the camera alone.<br/><br/>- The microphone is good... but not great. It is a solid choice for vlogging since it is omnidirectional.<br/><br/>- The picture quality is pretty good, but it's not going to blow you away.  Like most cameras, it does well in well-lit conditions (i.e sunlight) but it starts to fall short in indoor environments.  I was recently comparing footage (outdoors) between the ZV-1 and my iPhone 11 pro... the picture quality was comparable (although the iPhone has less shake).  I am not saying an iPhone is better for videoing (its not.. the ZV-1 has much, much better focusing, microphone, options, and etc).<br/><br/>- In a somewhat unfair comparison.. I recently filmed a trip to the zoo with both the ZV-1 and my Canon HFG60 (which also has a 1" sensor).  The Canon camcorder had a much better picture and I was able to film without the need of an active gimbal. Granted the Canon isn't designed to be used for one-handed vlogging..... but it did highlight some of the limits with the ZV-1<br/><br/>- Form - Another thing that Sony got right. The ZV-1 is super light, can easily be held one-handed, and has a nice articulating screen. I found the buttons to be a bit awkward and a bit too recessed which caused me to accidentally *not push* record when I was trying to record something.<br/><br/>- The Sony menu system is ok... I am not used to it... so it is bit cumbersome for me<br/><br/>- Pro features...  This camera isn't designed for pros. I see no option for manual focus (Not that big of a deal)  but you really can't even operate it in manual mode. It has a manual mode, but you're not going to be able to change the settings on the fly.<br/><br/>- The lens is a F1.8/2.8 so it is reasonably fast. It also allows for some decent bokeh despite a smallish sensor.<br/><br/>Final Verdict... It kinda feels like I a being hard on the ZV-1 by giving it 3 stars.  However.... on one of my trips, I forgot to bring the connecting plate for my gimbal, and the ZV-1 became nearly worthless.  While it has some very strong features... it could have been so much more!</span>

<span>This camera takes really good pictures. It is very well camouflaged in the tree where we placed it. We actually use it to track traffic coming in and out of our privately maintain road. In most situations, we can even read the tag number.

<span>I have two of these at my cabin. One camera is covering the driveway.  I like knowing if anyone is walking up the driveway when I'm not there. I also can tell how much snow has fallen since the last time I had the driveway plowed. The cabin is off grid with solar panels and batteries. The second camera covers the cabin and solar panels. I have an alarm system that runs by batteries, so it's helpful to know if the solar panels are covered with snow and not keeping the batteries charged. It's also interesting to see an occasional deer or turkey walk by. I like getting an automatic photo every day, so I know the cameras are working and the status of the driveway snow and solar panels.</span>

<span>Very easy to use. Just what my husband needed. He is not very good with electronic gadgets. This is perfect for him.  He took it to hunt camp. I am hoping it is durable enough to survive. If not, will order another.</span>

Product Description   Super sharp screw that makes it easy to screw into tree Camera head rotates 360 degrees and tilts up and down 120 degrees Supports all trail cameras with 1/4" x 20 threaded insert on bottom Great for placing trail camera in exact desired location Included wingnut makes for easy removal of camera   From the Manufacturer   The Better Trail Camera Holder utilizes the same "user friendly" installation procedures as our better line of bow hangers. Simply screw the mounting screw into the tree where you want the trail camera to face (A). Next place the camera holder mounting bracket onto the threaded stud of the mounting screw and install and tighten wing nut (B). It's that easy. Now screw the trail camera onto the threaded end of the camera mount so it is facing away from the adjustment arm and screw the camera lock up and against the bottom of camera to hold that position. Camera head rotates 360 degrees and tilts up and down 120 degrees for perfect camera placement. This simple, compact and sturdy design provides a dependable means for supporting all trail cameras with the 1/4" x 20 threaded insert on the bottom.

<span>I wanted to be able to hang some cams a bit higher and angle them down.  I bought this holder, HME similar one that just screws in and a 3 pack of simpler yet hangers.  I have the 1st 2 and not real thrilled that I need 2 wrenches to adjust the tilts.  Be so much easier with wing nuts or similar type of tool-free bolt/nut.  I will look to modify so I won't need the extra tools every time I set them up or adjust.  They are rugged and HME does make good products....this one just needed a little more thought.\<br/>UPDATE:  it wasn't quite as bad I thought.  You don't need to do much with wrenches once you have it "tightened" properly - you want it pretty tight so you can just move the adjustments yet the camera will stay in place.  However, tool free adjustment would be nice.</span>

<span>You’ll get a year at most out of these before it rusts and becomes impossible to adjust. I think this is my 3rd one as I haven’t found anything better to mount to a large tree.</span>
