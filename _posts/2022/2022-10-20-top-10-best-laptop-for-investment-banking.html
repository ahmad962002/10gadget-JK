<span>My job is entirely Google based.  I bought this as a second work computer because my company laptop is a Thinkpad and it's heavy.  I just wanted to leave that at home and have a nice sleek backup for any work tasks I'd need to do in a pinch out of the house.  I couldn't be more pleased with this.  It's light, fast, and the battery life is fantastic.  Lenovos are known for having great keyboards and this is the best one I've used on a small laptop.  It also doesn't look or feel cheap.  The only thing that shows 'budget' is the screen, as it won't blow you away.  But it's still very solid and surprisingly good from the side, where most screens in this price range are garbage viewed from an angle.  If you are in the market for a laptop, and you are in the probably 95% of the public that absolutely doesn't really need an $800 laptop for what they use it for, rush out and buy this one while the price is still insane.</span>

<span>Chromebooks have a life cycle of 8 years - this one was made in 2020, so it has about 6 or so years of support left. I didn't care and all I wanted was something small and light so I could write on my bed. I don't mind that it's a chromebook - in fact, this is my first chromebook and I'm in love. I'm planning to get another one for Black Friday if the price is good enough, because I love this one so much (I[m planning to have an indoor chromebook and an outdoor chromebook). The screen is a bit iffy, but it's good enough. I use this one more than I do my $700 tablet. I don't do anything heavy with it, so this is perfect for my needs.</span>

<span>I like the fact that it's a touchscreen and that you can place in all kinds of different positions to use it as a laptop and tablet without needing anything else. I've had it for close to a year and haven't had any issues at all.<br/> All Chromebooks come with only 8 years of software updates that start at time of manufacture. Mine was brand new but only had 4 left. For me the price made it a no brainier. In 4 years I'll just buy another one.</span>

<span>Full disclosure, I am not an IT professional but use laptops, tablets, and desktop computers daily in my personal and work life. This chromebook has far exceeded my expectations. This is my first time using a chromebook. I have had a week or so to really dig into the device. I own an alienware gaming laptop, but I find myself only using it now for gaming purposes only.<br/><br/>This chromebook is fast in my opinion. The speed is snappy and the device responds quickly to gestures and commands. I have yet to find sometime I can't do on this that I do on my windows laptop aside from gaming. One game I like to play requires windows, mac, or linux. Since this has an ARM processor it does not support linux applications at this time.<br/><br/>Design: This device is a bright attractive white chromebook. I find the design to be pleasing to the eye and appears sturdy even though it is made from plastic. I do not particularly like using it in tablet mode. The screen feels bulky and sometimes unmanageable in tablet mode. The screen quickly transitions to whatever position to place it in whether laptop, tent, or tablet mode. I personal find myself not even using my LG tablet for much of anything except when I need LTE internet away from home. Overall the design is great.<br/><br/>Screen/Input: I find the keyboard to be on par with most laptop keyboards. The keys are a little shallow and I feel my typing has slowed a little bit, but not by much. The IPS touchscreen is very responsive and rarely find myself having to touch the screen more than once for my intended gesture. Screen is bright in home conditions, but feel it would lack in more intense lighting situations, such as outdoors.<br/><br/>Ease of Use: The google play store makes this thing be able to do just about anything. I have not tried any intense applications. I use chrome, netflix, hulu, evernote, several banking apps, and various other apps. All of them are snappy responsive. The bank apps load like they are in phone mode, thus they are in a small window. The apps still work as designed. Netflix and Hulu playback is smooth and pleasant to watch on the screen.<br/><br/>Overall, I am impressed with the Google OS and this device in general. If your someone who is on the fence about the operating system, I suggest you give it a try. The battery life is good as well. When using my gaming laptop its always with a cord tethered nearby. I also understand a gaming laptop is far more power intensive. I have yet to use this chromebook while charging it. The battery has allowed me to watch 4-5 hours of netflix, talk on facebook, and text through my phone without ever getting critically low. I charge it at night and then never put it back on till the next night. This is a max screen brightness. I was also very surprised with the speakers. The speakers were much louder and not distorted. I honestly expected them to be cheap netbook quality that is mostly better just to never use them, but thats not the case with this chromebook. I do generally use a bluetooth headset. The bluetooth headset paired with extreme simplicity. I also set up my brother wireless laser printer with google cloud print in less than 30 seconds.<br/><br/>Google did it right and lenovo delivered a solid product. I did purchase this on sale for $200 but would have spent the $300. If your a web surfer, music listener, netflix watcher I highly recommend this. If you need windows intense software then go with windows. Otherwise I think you'll find yourself using this as your primary device as I have.</span>

<span>Renewed Lenovo C330 arrived in a huge box clearly marked HEAVY LOAD....someone had a sense of humor being that the whole thing weighed only 4 pounds and you could have put ten of these in boxes inside their big box!<br/><br/>Opening the box the description had said it had cosmetic damage on the sides and gouges on the case, close inspection revealed no damage, it was MINT condition plus the moment I cracked the lid open it was already setting itself up and after a couple of minutes it was ready to go, (try that WINDOWS!) it had syncd itself from my other Chromebook!<br/><br/>The main reason I bought the Lenovo Chromebook was to see first hand how it compared to the two Acer Chromebooks I have, the Acer Spin 713 and the Acer R13, both having a lot of aggrivating issues relating to OS integration.<br/><br/>Acer both 713 and R13 had serious issues with poor sound loudness and quality, image quality is poor even though they were running over 2000 resolution, poor internet speed as both 713 and R13 kept switching to lower speed settings, while virtual keyboard settings in both Acer's suffered from serious lag, and screen fragmentation, Bluetooth pairing was poor with continual drops and no restart if computer woke from sleep and slower overall performance on and offline if used as a tablet.<br/><br/>Lenovo: Suffers from none of the above and excel's in many areas starting with Sound which is LOUD, image quality even with a low 1366 resolution is tight, sharp, and vivid, internet speed stayed where you put it and is quick, virtual keyboard no issues, Bluetooth pairs easily and is ready after sleep with no drops, tablet performance no different, quick and precise.<br/><br/>I agree with some other comments that this is a really handsome computer, the eggshell white with dark grey keys is a real eye catcher, that backed up by a great overall experience and I just noticed the price for these as renewed from the Amazon Warehouse has dropped, you will NOT be dissapointed!<br/>Now for the real twist:  I have bought 9 different Chromebooks over the past couple of months to see if they had that something special that makes them indespensible and I must honestly say that my Fire Tablets 7 through 10 and ONLY the Fire Tablets are much more useful, easy to use, take a ton less space, have much broader uses, easier to take with, typically much higher video, image and sound quality and much faster on the internet and cost waaaay less but give you so much more, so the grand experiment is done and I will be finding some good homes for the Chromebooks.</span>

<span>You might think that only 4 gb for a Windows 10 laptop that cant expand the ram is a bad idea... Well, I've found this small laptop is actually fine, even quick for internet browsing, email, word processing and watching videos.  Sure, the keyboard is smaller, but even with large hands, I had no trouble typing...<br/><br/> Obviously, this is not a good choice for gaming or video editing work.  Battery life is very good for the intended basic uses; not Apple Ipad good;  but should give you at least 6+ hours for the basics...<br/><br/> It DOES have a micro SD slot, in addition to the 2 USB ports.<br/><br/>While you can't expand the RAM, you can also expand the storage with an internal NVME stick.<br/><br/>This is a great idea as it noticeably speeds up the computer if you make it the boot drive.  I added a 500GB Samsung 980 NVME stick and am very pleased with the results.<br/><br/>Having read about issues with the Samsung Magician cloning software, and difficulties in making a boot drive change work well on this laptop; let me tell you what worked well for me...<br/><br/>Ordered the Samsung nvme stick, along with a $15 external USB enclosure for this type of chewing gum stick size drive. Downloaded the free version of Easeus Partition Master software to clone the built in Asus L210 drive. Loaded the new stick in the external drive enclosure, connected the drive with a USB cable to a USB slot on the Asus, and followed the directions to clone the Asus C drive.  Opened the Asus and inserted the Samsung stick into the open nvme slot. Pressed power button holding down F2 key to get into bios.<br/><br/>Change the boot order to start with the nvme stick. Save and exit. Booting then detected issues with Windows, so choose to download and install a new, clean copy of Windows 10.  ( If you do this right after you have received the Asus, then you don't have any reason to save data or settings on this Windows clean install.  You don't yet have any personal data to save.)  When Windows is finished with the reinstall, make sure to do your windows updates.<br/><br/>After that is done, use Disk management tool to reformat the original drive,  and resize the partitions on the new nvme drive to what is available.<br/><br/>Now your little, inexpensive laptop is faster, with plenty of drive space.  Certainly one of the better values you can get in a very portable size, great for traveling when you may not want to carry a larger, more expensive laptop.  Screen quality is very good, and the Asus has a full size hdmi out for easy video sharing.  Definitely recommended for the price point and its intended use.</span>

<span>I bought this machine because I was looking for a small, inexpensive machine with good battery life to use for writing and media consumption when travelling, without having to worry much about it being damaged, broken or stolen.<br/><br/>This laptop comes with a 64GB eMMC disk which is small and not very fast. I bought an M.2 SSD to add to this laptop as the primary disk (I bought a Western Digital SN550 SSD). To add the M.2 SSD, you have to remove the ten screws at the bottom of the laptop (there are two different lengths of screw, so mark the holes with the longer screws when removing). Removing the bottom cover is a bit tricky because it is very tight - start at a corner and insert plastic credit card or similar into the gap, Then pull the credit card around the seam to pop off the clips (the trick is to not push the credit card too far into the seam, or it will get caught. Insert it only a tiny bit into the seam and it will glide easily). Once you have removed the bottom cover the place to insert the SSD is labelled on the motherboard. You just push it in, then add a single screw to secure it. The screw doesn't ship with the SSD usually, but if you need one you can buy a kit for a few dollars - search for "M.2 mounting screws" and you can get a kit with screws and screwdriver in the correct size, which can also be used to remove the case screws.<br/><br/>Once you've added the SSD, it won't appear in windows until you've formatted it in disk manager, which you can open by searching for "disk" in start menu and hitting "create and format hard disk partitions".<br/><br/>Once formatted, you can use it as a regular disk, but for best performance, reinstall windows on the SSD. To do that, create Windows 10 installation media - search google for "Create installation media for Windows" then follow instructions. You'll need a USB drive that's 8GB or bigger.<br/><br/>Once you've created installation media, install Windows on SSD (hit F2 when booting laptop to get into BIOS to select startup disk). Drivers are available from ASUS site (search "asus L210 drivers" then hit "support"). Windows will automatically find the digital license for your machine and activate.<br/><br/>Running on the SSD, performance for the machine is very good considering the price. Processor is fast enough to watch 4K youtube videos, should you wish to. Keyboard is fine-to-good. Touchpad is OK - good considering price. Speakers are not great, but good enough for watching youtube and as good as I would expect for this price and size. There is no backlit keyboard but that's not something I care about. Screen is fine, good for price. Overall build quality feels very good compared to other units in this price range. Machine feels light.<br/><br/>Battery life is excellent - using windows 10 "battery saver" mode (activate by pressing speech bubble in bottom right of task bar then hitting battery save) I routinely get 12 hours or more with normal usage and medium brightness, which is really excellent for the price in my opinion.<br/><br/>If you want a small, cheap machine with very good battery life and decent performance, and you are willing to add the M.2 SSD, this is a great choice.</span>

<span>I'm giving this little engine that could five stars. Why? Well, it's two hundred dollars. So I'm reviewing it as a two hundred dollar product. If I was comparing it to a Macbook Air M1, it would probably be three stars. If I was comparing it to a Microsoft Surface, three and a half. But it's a small, budget laptop, and in that category, it's excellent.<br/><br/>QUICK RUNDOWN - It blows my mind how good of a job they did with this. I've used a lot of computers, and this one impresses me. If you've ever had a Chromebook, or even just a cheap (or perhaps even more expensive) laptop you'll feel the difference immediately. It has a few issues, none of which are deal breakers, but it has many, many pros. Read on.<br/><br/>PROS --<br/>Incredible Price to Performance Ratio<br/>Very well built, with no cheap parts<br/>Full-size, comfortable keyboard<br/>Small and lightweight<br/>Good design (add stickers if it's a little too plain for you)<br/>Full Windows 10 License, and no hardwired bloatware<br/>Internal NVMe slot and external SD Card slot<br/>I could keep going... it's $200.<br/><br/>CONS --<br/>No backlight keyboard (at least on the 11.6 model)<br/>Some irksome viewing angle problems<br/>Maddeningly little built in storage<br/>Almost too little RAM<br/>Realtek Wifi Card (explained why in the 'Linux' section)<br/><br/>I've divided the review into individual sections: webcam, speakers, performance, software, etc, so scroll down to the one that's most important to you, or read the review from top to bottom. They are (in order):<br/><br/>Introduction (above)<br/>Weight &amp; Build<br/>Keyboard and Trackpad<br/>Screen<br/>Battery<br/>Performance (including Gaming)<br/>Webcam<br/>Speakers &amp; Sound<br/>Software<br/>Linux<br/>Other (SD Card Slot, NVMe slot, HDMI output, heating, cleaning)<br/>Conclusion<br/><br/>Let me start with a few disclaimers. First, I've only been using it for a few weeks, which is about enough time to get a good sense of its mettle and iron out any problems it has. There's been a few things I've noticed that I've added to this review, (see 'performance' and 'screen') and I'll add more if more arise. No problem has been significant enough that it made me in any way wonder if it was worth. $200 is a really good price point.<br/><br/>The second disclaimer, is there's a few reviewers saying either A, they got a dud, or B, it clunked out on them after two years. Duds happen, with any product, this is no exception. So if mine does decided to go on the fritz, I'll update my review relative to the exchange process - I WON'T deduct stars *just* because it gave out. Second, if you get two years of solid use out of this, it's a good product. Just buy another one.<br/><br/>With that being said, let me get into the details.<br/><br/>WEIGHT AND BUILD - This is one of its greatest strengths, and rivals many laptops in higher price ranges. There's no creaks, no cheap plastic waiting to shatter, it's not a flimsy toy. It's a solid electronic. It feels right, in your hands, on your lap, on a desk. So many laptops try and woo you with larger screens or better specs [or, for the life of me, a lower price tag], and turn out to be cup coasters you have to plug in. Not this. It really feels like it has some life in it.<br/><br/>It's not obscenely light, like a MacBook Air, but you can move about and use it on your lap without strain. If traveling's your kind of thing, then the weight is sufficient. I would feel comfortable carrying it through an airport.<br/><br/>The screen hinge feels durable and like it won't be breaking anytime soon, and when you set it at the position you like, it stays. The laptop isn't super-ultra-mega thin, but it is thin, and that's a nice bonus. You could probably fit it in an envelope, just maybe a slightly larger envelope then the one Steve Jobs used.<br/><br/>KEYBOARD AND TRACKPAD - The keyboard, I'm in love with. It's full size; no cramping on tiny keys or accidentally presses. The give is decisive and gratifying, and it just feels good to use. The keyboard is actually the one (literally, the only one) thing I feel they cut a little too close to the corner on. There's no backlight. It appears as those some of the models have a backlight, though I'm not sure, but mine doesn't. (I got the 11.6 model). This can be a little frustrating, and I'm considering getting a book light so I can type in the dark. Again, this is a two hundred dollar laptop, so it is what it is. I'll make due.<br/><br/>Another note, is they put the 'delete' key right next to the power key. Shucks. A few times, I've gone to press the delete key, and the computer goes into sleep mode. This is more of an inconvenience than anything. Just press the power button again and it will start right back up where you left off. Still, if you're doing sensitive work, it's something to consider, and I'm sure you'll learn very quickly to be cautious.<br/><br/>Also, the 'enter' key is green. I thought this was strange, but I really like it. Hard to explain.<br/><br/>The trackpad is responsive and that click is also decisive and gratifying. I don't have any issues accidentally pressing it while I'm typing, and it's very good at doing what I expect it to. If I click or tap, the mouse clicks. If I click on the right, it right clicks. Scrolling is painless and intuitive and very nuanced. The numpad on the keyboard is a nice touch, though I would have traded it for a backlit keyboard.<br/><br/>SCREEN - Going back to where we started, this is a two hundred dollar laptop. You're not getting an Apple Retina display. It has some minor viewing angle problems you'll have to accommodate for. If you're looking directly at it, everything looks good - pure colors, no whitening. If you turn it horizontally or bend the screen back, there's a noticeable change in tone. It is what it is, and it likely won't interfere with your work. Just don't do color grading for professional photoshoots on it.<br/><br/>The screen resolution is just right. The screen is small, but there's enough room to do what you want and then some. This is one of the most significant factors in comfort. If it were cramped, it would give you a headache and strain your eyes. But they did a good job of making sure there's some breathing room with a healthy buffer zone around whatever it is you're focusing on. You feel like you can move and engage in multiple things.<br/><br/>There's a few reviews complaining it's not a touch screen. You can't please everyone. It's not something I feel is missing, especially for $200.<br/><br/>BATTERY - The battery life is on point. The time remaining Windows estimates seems to vary quite a bit, but I watched two movies and used it for 4 hours, and still had 17%. It's the kind of thing you can charge at night and it will last you the day under normal conditions. It also doesn't have quick charge, another little cut corner, but I'm not stressing about it. Then again, I'm around a power outlet most of the time. If quick charge is an issue for you, you're in the wrong price point.<br/><br/>Side note: the charging port really plugs in. You have to give it a little oomph to pull it out. Which can be a pro and a con. You definitely don't want to trip on the cord; the whole thing will go flying off the table. But you can reposition the device without having to worry about the cord falling out.<br/><br/>PERFORMANCE - This is actually one of its biggest strengths, and really surprised me. All the components come together to create a seamless experience. I was nervous about the odd named Intel Processor (N6 something something) but it turns out, it's actually an Intel Celeron. And only four gigs of memory? Doesn't seem like quite enough. But it somehow manages to muscle out the minimum, and have some left over. My guess is, this is largely due to the SSD. Just a few years ago, laptop manufacturers had two options for storage: a physical hard drive, which was expensive, bulky, and a power drain, or some sort of memory like a thumb drive. Both were slow and huge bottle necks.<br/><br/>Well, this thing has a Solid State Drive. And that makes all the difference. With a decent processor, just enough memory, and the SSD, it will breeze through any routine task you ask it to do: open Microsoft Word, surf the web, torrent files, play music, and it will do it all without a hitch. Performance, under reasonable conditions, should never be a problem: you'll never feel a pause or get frustrated.<br/><br/>I LOVE the original Warhammer: 40K: Dawn of War series. This plays it effortlessly, even with mods. Which is very welcomed. I can imagine it can also play Sins of a Solar Empire, Age of Empires, Among Us, Terraria, and maybe even Minecraft, if that's your kind of thing. Check out GOG.com (great old games) and you'll be surprised at what's out there. If you are planning to do some light gaming, the NVMe slot will really come in handy.<br/><br/>IMPORTANT EDIT: After using it for some weeks, the lack of RAM is starting to become an issue. Windows has done a good job managing memory, but even day-to-day tasks can overwhelm it. This expresses itself as stalled applications, dropped Chrome tabs, or even system notifications that the system has run out of Memory. It did reach a significant error, though - everything went black, and after a reboot, Windows wanted to help set up my system (which is a big error.) Luckily everything was intact, my files, settings and programs. So it's just kind of a startling headache.<br/><br/>I was running a few programs, nothing too demanding. So if you're planning on using this for anything more then Spotify and Chrome, be forewarned.<br/><br/>WEBCAM - The webcam is about what you would expect. It's a hefty 0.3 megapixels, but there aren't any dropped frames, and the color processing is alright. If you need a webcam on the fly, it'll due. If you use a webcam for any serious purposes, I would suggest investing in a nice one, which you were probably going to do anyway. The device will be able to handle it without issue.<br/><br/>Of special note, is the microphone, which is actually great. Audio comes through clear and audible, distinct and focused. If you do find yourself in a situation where you have to use the onboard webcam, the video quality won't be great, but you won't have any problem being heard and understood.<br/><br/>SPEAKERS &amp; SOUND - The speakers are placed under the device, pointing directly down. You would think this would make them impossible to hear, but it projects and doesn't distort the sound. I've watched a few movies, and haven't had an issue hearing them - it gets plenty loud. I'm a bit of an audiophile, (though there are many more advance then I), and what I can say about these speakers is they're passable. They're not so bad that you're getting irked with the sound quality, but they're not so good you would enjoy Beethoven's 5th. The various aspects of sound - the bass, and whatever else the other parts are called, are balanced and clear.<br/><br/>If you're using it for casual media use, the lackluster sound quality will fade into the background and you'll be able to enjoy whatever it is you're doing.<br/><br/>The headphone amplifier is decent and it appears they didn't skimp on it. I tested it with a pair of Sony MDR7506s (which are one-for-one studio monitors with a higher than average impedance.) The amplifier didn't quit reach optimal levels, but it produced clear and pleasing sound. (and it does have a nice kick to it.) For an onboard amplifier, it's more then adequate. If you're a real audiophile and use an external amplifier, the primary factor to consider is if the sound it's putting out can be boosted, and it definitely can.<br/><br/>SOFTWARE - There's a few pieces of bloatware you'll want to uninstall. McAfee, Skype, MyAsus. (if you don't know what bloatware is, ask the techy in your family to remove it for you.) Fortunately, none of them are hard coded into the software or hardware, so uninstalling them is straight forward and simple and can be done through 'Add or Remove Programs.' The laptop does come in Windows S mode (which is suppose to be a simpler version of Windows, but has some bothersome limitations for power users.) They made it extremely easy to convert into regular Windows 10. I clicked a button once and haven't had to worry about it since: full Windows 10.<br/><br/>LINUX - I'm not a super user when it comes to Linux. I do know enough to install and use it on a day-to-day basis, and for low-performance computers like this one, Linux is tantalizing. Unfortunately, the WiFi card in the system [as of 11/19/21] doesn't work with Linux and there doesn't seem to be any support on the horizon. Most people who need or prefer Linux have taken to using a USB WiFi antenna, an untenable inconvenience for most. Some people have been reporting switching out the NIC entirely, but I don't know enough to speak about that.<br/><br/>OTHER - What I find really helpful is the SD Card Slot. The 64 gigs of storage it comes with goes REALLY quick. I like to watch, uh, documentaries in public domain (like 'Joker' with Joaquin Phoenix). It's amazingly simple to plug in an SD card (I got a 256gb one for $45), set up uTorrent to load all the unfinished and finished torrents onto the card, and that solves the whole problem. Just about any SD card you buy will be fast enough to download movies and play one at the same time.<br/><br/>Other reviewers have pointed out it comes with a slot for an NVMe SSD. If you don't know what that is, it probably doesn't make much of a difference. If you do, it's a very helpful addition. Hooray.<br/><br/>It has tons of ports, which is great. Two USB ports, a USB-C port, the above mentioned SD card slot, an auxiliary port, and an HDMI port. I've used the HDMI port on a full screen TV, and it works for watching a movie. The quality of the movie file will make a difference - but the sound compression changes that are necessary with downloaded media [generally done through VLC] help a lot. It's not blu-ray, but performance doesn't seem to be affected by what's happening in a scene or the amount of sound.<br/><br/>If you're planning on using this for presentations, it's exactly what you want. Plug, play 'n forget.<br/><br/>During normal, unplugged, use you wouldn't be able to tell that it's turned on just by the heat. If you're running a process-intensive program or have it plugged in, it does heat up, but that's normal. You can use it on your lap without a worrying. I don't see heating being an issue. It's also fanless, which is a big deal if you live in a dusty environment. You won't slowly be running it into the ground just by using it, listening to the fan whir louder and louder as it tries to compensate for all the dust.<br/><br/>Side note: If it overheats, it'll just turn off. It won't hurt it.<br/><br/>I like to take good care of my computers, so ease of cleaning matters to me. Being fanless, that alleviates a lot of of the issues you would come across. Still, you can't access behind the keyboard, so it will be interesting to see how that plays out. You might be able to remove each key and clean it out, which would go a long way, but I wouldn't try it without doing some research and carefully weighing the benefits and risks.<br/><br/>Either way, do yourself a favor: buy a small pack of Q-tips, a little bottle of house hold cleaner (Pinesol works well), and lens clothes, and throw them in the bag or case you're carrying the laptop in. Occasionally go over the keyboard with the Q-tips and wipe down the exterior, and the lens cloth will come in handy a lot more then you think. I don't know if it will necessarily add to the life of the machine, but it will feel a lot better. And it's worth taking some pride in your devices.<br/><br/>CONCLUSION - The bottom line is, is it feels good to use. Everything from the keyboard to the performance to the build quality makes it a very enjoyable and complete experience: there's nothing really lacking that will get in your way. It's spectacular for day-to-day use, and it's got a little muscle to it. For $200, you're getting a real product, and it even has something to say to higher end laptops. If you decide to go with this, I think you'll be very pleased.</span>

<span>Bought this on a deal.  It has been a nice entry level gaming laptop for my husband.  I like that this can be upgraded with the extra RAM slot and an extra SSD slot and 2.5 bay.  Something to keep in mind, this does not accept anything made by crucial. I don’t know why, but I had a crucial nvme m2 internal ssd (4x4 gaming ssd) and a crucial 2.5 ssd and both caused the laptop to stay on a black screen upon boot up.  After a lot of research, there were many forums from others saying they also ran into this problem and crucial storage is not compatible with the bios.  Would I have bought this at full price at around $1000.  No.  For the deal I got it at, yes.  If you can get this during a deal and looking for a great starter gaming laptop, this is a good choice to go with.</span>

<span>This was the first gaming computer I ever bought, so I had no idea that the plugs were different from regular computers. When I first plugged it in and tried to turn it on, nothing happened. I thought I got a bum computer! I called the number on the package and was told that gaming computers have different plugs than standard computers, and that I had to push the plug into the back of the computer all the way until I heard a click. I thought I had, but when I pushed on it again I heard the click and it started right up.<br/><br/>Onto the computer itself... the graphics are great, the speed has worked well for all the games used so far (Minecraft, Bloons TD6, etc.), the picture is vivid, and I have no complaints so far!</span>

<span>Keep expectations realistic do your research for what kind of games your gonna play how this hardware stacks up to running sed games and your gonna have a good time and be happy with your buy. The only ball drop by Microsoft or Acer was i had to download some additional C++ code to get some games running how they should. I play fighting games and this laptop suits my needs and runs the games without issue should also be enough to handle street fighter 6 with no issues playing more demanding games performance may decline. You also need to understand you absolutely will not be gaming without being plugged into the charger you will just gimp the component's if you don't play plugged into a outlet and have a bad time. Make sure you set up the PC to optimize performance and take full advantage of its dedicated nividia card and intel processor the ram can be upgraded but i would only put 16gigs in max the 8 gig stick is okay. The native 144hz screen is impressive for the price this laptop costs all in all if you know what your doing and know how games will run on the hardware that you want to play you will be happy with the buy. Understand this all depends on the type of games you want the hardware to play and what those games will be asking the system to preform i cant stress that fact enough please do your research before you buy that means you parents of children google and youtube are your friend when it comes to this.</span>

<span>I've only had this for a day now, so I can't speak to longevity. All in all I'm pleased with this laptop. It's lightweight but packs a punch still. Set up and updating was quick and easy. It's a great utilization of space, only a slim border around the screen and keyboard.<br/><br/>A few first impression negatives: you can see in other review images that it comes with 5 semi permanent stickers, (Nvidia, Intel, Alexa, 144hz, and a long feature banner). That was a bummer because they weren't in the product image, and they look awful (not to mention some were crooked). Thankfully they're removable, though I had to use glass cleaner to get rid of residue from one. Not a big deal though. The frame is very lightweight and flexible. The feet keep it raised which is good for cooling, but any pressure on the middle makes it flex, which I don't love. It's not going to crumble, but it's definitely a step down from my Lenovo with a metal body. You're paying for the internal components, not the frame.</span>

<span>I'm far from a computer expert. I bought this computer for work because my job requires me to use a couple of different specific software programs. I needed a computer with a lot of storage, a fairly large screen, a numerical keypad, and most importantly, a cheap price tag. This computer has all of those things. I don't do any gaming or anything really sophisticated on it. Just work and some internet browsing. It boots up quickly and has been running smoothly so far. My biggest complaint is that it came with a lot of Microsoft bloatware that I hadn't experienced on my other laptops and by default it uses your Microsoft OneDrive for storage instead of the computer's SSD. The first time I logged onto the computer it asked me to either sign up for a Microsoft account or login to an existing one. My job requires me to take a lot of photos, so I was saving my photos to the computer without realizing it was uploading to my cloud storage account. That was an annoyance because I had to figure out how to switch that off. I unintentionally used up all of my cloud storage space because I didn't realize the system was set up that way. Once I figured out how to fix it, I was good to go. Also, the computer essentially comes in a "safe mode" which limits a lot of what you can do. It is designed for you to only use apps from the Microsoft app store and not download any software from any other source. It can be turned off, but it is another annoyance. I feel like they were trying to make it like their version of a Chromebook, but that makes it just as annoying as a Chromebook. Overall, it is a great computer once you get past all the Microsoft stuff.</span>

<span>I would just like to note that this model only has one RAM slot, not two, as the Q&amp;A answers from Acer have stated. I purchased two 16GB modules on the basis that I would be able to take out the 4GB module and then put the two new ones in, giving me 32GB total. However when you take the back cover off, there is only one RAM slot on the motherboard. I don't mean one FREE ram slot, just one slot, period. It's empty, which means I was able to put one of the 16GB modules in, making for a total of 20GB, which isn't bad, but it's annoying to do your due diligence and read everything you can about a product, including statements from the manufacturer, only to find that the reality is different. My guess is that earlier models did in fact have two RAM slots, but since Amazon mixes models together on the same product page, it can be impossible to know exactly which model someone is talking about. Whatever, it is what it is, just know that this particular model A515-46-R3UB only has a single RAM slot. I don't even know where the other 4GB module is, maybe soldered onto the motherboard elsewhere, but I looked everywhere and I couldn't see any other places to put a second RAM module. I'm not a computer expert by any means, but I am a software developer and I have built my own PC from motherboard up, so I know what a RAM slot looks like. This only has one, so be warned.<br/><br/>The other thing that bugged me about this was the arrangement for inserting a 2.5 hard drive. In my case I wanted to put a 4TB Samsung SSD, which fit just fine into the frame, and then you screw the frame into the case, which is fine. The bad part is the little, itsy bitsy ribbon cable that have to connect the hard drive to the motherboard. First, I had to look up a youtube video to even know what I needed to look for on the motherboard. It's a tiny little slot covered with a white rubber cover, which you lever up, and then slide the end of the ribbon cable into it. The problem is, there's no positivity to the connection, like you have with the larger size regular SATA cables. No "click", because the cable is just a flexible, thin piece of plastic. There's not even any way to really know if it's aligned correctly. So you just fiddle around with it, not knowing if you're damaging the flimsy thing as you try to push it into a slot which gives you zero tactile feedback. After many attempts to insert it, only to feel it lift away without any resistance (meaning it hadn't inserted at all), eventually I got it to "stay", though it wasn't quite straight, that was as good as I could get it. Horrible design, if you ask me. I don't see that they couldn't have made the port a "real" one, there was plenty of height inside the case to be able to accommodate it. But again, whatever.<br/><br/>Finally, I wanted to put Debian on here, since I assumed that the latest version would work with the hardware. Not so much. The Wifi hardware in particular just would not work at all, even with Bullseye. And when I tried putting unstable on there, it stopped dead during install asking me to supply a number of firmware files which appeared to be related to the Wifi hardware, but I couldn't find those files anywhere online. Very frustrating.<br/><br/>Eventually I ended up installing Ubuntu instead, which isn't ideal since I like my development environment to be the same as my server, which is Debian. But I decided to try it, since I know that Ubuntu tends to do a better job with strange hardware drivers. Sure enough, it went without a hitch this time, and the wifi worked.<br/><br/>So now I have an Ubuntu laptop with a 4TB SSD and 20GB RAM, and it seems ok so far, so I'll probably keep it since other options out there seem to have their own issues - either the screen is bad, or the keyboard, or whatever, there's always something. At least this laptop seems to have a nice screen, the keyboard isn't too bad, and 20GB, while not what I wanted, should be enough to do what I want in reality. The webcam seems a little grainy, but I'm not a big webcam user anyway, so.<br/><br/>All in all it's a pretty good deal, if you know what you're going to have to deal with and are willing to fiddle around a bit. The one RAM slot, tiny trashy hard drive cable, and driver issues with Linux (at least the Wifi), everything can be worked around to some extent. I guess it just depends what you are willing to put up with.<br/><br/>I was thinking about posting a photo of the motherboard to show the single RAM slot, but it's all screwed back together now (11 tiny screws) so to be honest I can't be bothered. Just take my word for it, there's just the one RAM slot, not two as all the Q&amp;A seem to say. Be warned.</span>

<span>I bought this for my wife, who does e-Bay, Skype calls to family, normal business stuff and no gaming. I was very surprised that it have better performance than I expect for an entry level machine. The screen and keyboard are magnificent.<br/><br/>The only problem I have is that there is no removeable battery. That means that if you are installing a second hard drive there is no way to know if your machine is truly off. If you do that, ignore the instructions and add the additional step of disconnecting the battery cable before you plug in the cable. Welding is not something you want to do in the innards of a new laptop. The laptop is fine, so the design is resilient. We just don't have the use of a second disk drive or the USB connector on the left side.</span>

<span>Only has one ram slot and a soldered on 4gb of ram so can upgrade enough and the hard drive can be added I like the ability to choose your own hard drive size to put in instead of being stuck with a low amount... Less ewaste.  Also speaking of the hard drive I had read a review about the hard drive ribbon cable connector you cannot lift up you have to unscrew the Wi-Fi chip to be able to lift a little tab for the hard drive ribbon cable see picture</span>

<span>I purchased this laptop with the sole purpose of installing Linux. I didn't want to mess with my better computers Secure Boot to try to dual boot it. I  had read on one website that this particular model, and this processor worked well with Linux.<br/><br/>I'm happy to report that Manjaro XFCE Linux installed and booted flawlessly. The only thing I had to do was change the display resolution - very easy to do with the graphical tools included. The only problem was a setting the proper time. I had to do that through the terminal, but was extremely simple and has maintained the proper time ever since.<br/><br/>The display quality doesn't match my more expensive laptop, but is more than  acceptable for normal use, including watching videos. The computer is fairly responsive for normal use, including watching videos.  All in all,  I am happy with this computer for running a Linux distribution.</span>

<span>I'm writing this for a typical user, using plain language, so they know what they are getting into.<br/><br/>I've been in the IT profession for 27 years. For most of that time I fixed other people's machines for a living; dealing with the demands of an engineering workforce. I also use PhotoShop a lot on my home workstation, which is a monster configured for performance, so yes, I know what I'm talking about.<br/><br/>I bought this laptop, knowing it was a toy. The only thing I'm going to used if for is surfing the web and checking email using a browser. I don't need it to do anything crazy, but I want to have more control over what little data I plan to store on it than a Chromebook. For the record this was to replace a 6 year old HP Pavilion x2 Detachable. So a 5 star rating means it does everything I want it to do at least as well as the machine it replaced, and not my graphics monster. I'm approaching this review as if I was a typical customer.<br/><br/>My preferred browser is Opera, so I had to get this machine out of S Mode to install it. It's the only change I made to the initial setup from HP. S Mode is not it's fault, that's a Windows thing. We don't deal with S Mode in the corporate world, so it took a little research to discover that removing it is an app off the MS Store.<br/><br/>My first impression was it's pretty terrible. Opera frequently had lag while typing and that isn't good at all. Edge, the default browser wasn't much better. Very slow to load pages, and a lot of buffering on youtube. I almost returned it, until I mucked around a bit and experimented. I found that Avast Secure Browser gave me the performance I expected from a low end machine. But it took work that is beyond an average user's knowledge and skills to make it adequate, and that's a serious problem.<br/><br/>Honestly, if it came optimized the way I made, it, I'd give it a 4, maybe 5. BUT it took work beyond the skills of a normal user... that would make it a 3, if you only wanted to do web browsing and email. BUT (again) it's offering Office 365 free for a year, and based on what I saw, there is absolutely no way this machine can handle Office.... so that's why it gets a 2.<br/><br/>If you're looking for a light weight low power machine for web surfing and email, that has better data management than a Chromebook, then this is an adequate machine. Do not expect it to be good enough for a child's school computer... please.</span>

<span>I have two MacBook Airs (MBA), a 13" and a 11, both with the previous form factor (the wide, body colored bezel around the screen, 1280x800 resolution) and this new 13" MBA improves upon it in every way (almost) and makes it nearly perfect.<br/><br/>Good:<br/><br/>- SCREEN looks great!  2560x1600 resolution is bright and sharp and looks good with the thin black bezel.  I usually don't go above 50% brightness.<br/><br/>- KEYBOARD is good.  Some have mentioned that it still sucks, but I find it much better than the older MBAs that I own and better than say, the Magic Keyboard.  Even with a thin silicone keyboard cover I find the typing experience to be much better and I can type faster and with fewer mistakes.<br/><br/>- BATTERY LIFE is fantastic.  Haven't done any real testing yet and obviously it depends on a lot of factors (wifi usage, video streaming, HD vs 4k video viewing/processing/etc., screen brightness, type of app being used, etc.) but for my usage (mostly web browsing, video viewing on YouTube, accessing VPN for work (Citrix, EPIC), etc., it has been great.  Easily tops 10 hours and super impressed so far.<br/><br/>- LOOKS GREAT.  Love the newer (I know that the actual exterior design is a few years old by now) design, looks and feels great.  Form factor is nice and it is a reasonable weight.<br/><br/>- NO FAN.  That's awesome, as it not only stays quiet all the time but you also do not need to worry about blocking any fan vents on the bottom or back of the case while you have it on your lap.  Pretty amazing really for a laptop to have no fans.<br/><br/>- PERFORMANCE.  It works great so far on what I have used it for, which is not terribly a lot, but it is what it is for a laptop using Apple silicon for the first time.  For just day to day use and things like Chrome, Office (Word, Excel), Citirx, EPIC, etc., it has been super smooth and fast.  Have not tried gaming yet but do not have high hopes given it is the base model with 7-core GPU.  Also, things like start up are noticeably faster with the M1 versus my 2020 iMac 27" (top end) with Intel chips.<br/><br/>- TOUCH ID is great still.  Works very fast and the button does not get greasy (which makes it not work well) like the old iPhone home buttons.  On the other hand, it should really have Face ID at this point.<br/><br/>- APPLE ECOSYSTEM is great as usual and a real reason to get this MBA.  Apple Watch easily unlocks it (so you do not really need Face ID if you have the watch).  You can easily send/receive files using AirDrop or cast using AirPlay.  And so on and so forth.<br/><br/>- BIG SUR comes preinstalled but you need to update to get 11.0.1.<br/><br/>NOT GOOD:<br/><br/>- WEBCAM still sucks.  Still low resolution and just does not look good in FaceTime, Teams, etc.  Shame that Apple is so slow to upgrade webcams on the Macs (the 27" iMac FINALLY upgraded to 1080p front cams only a couple months ago... I got one and it looks so much better than this MBA's camera).<br/><br/>- ONLY 2 PORTS.  Sad that this thing has only 2 USB-C ports (that cover thunderbolt 3, USB 3.1, charging, DisplayPort).  Given that it is used to charge, it leaves only one USB-C port for other use, pretty lame.  I wish they had squeezed (I think it would fit) a USB-A port so that I could plug in my wireless mouse USB-A dongle as I have never liked any bluetooth mouse, or at least one more USB-C port.<br/><br/>- NEW TECH (Apple silicon) means the M1-optimized apps are still being rolled out, e.g. Photoshop still not available at release.<br/><br/>- BATTERY still cannot be removed, no surprise here, but means that like all Apple mobile tech it will have a useable lifespan determined at least partly by the non-removable battery.  Easier to have an iPhone's battery replaced than a MBA I would imagine but hopefully it maintains a high level of performance for 4 years at the minimum.<br/><br/>OVERALL:<br/><br/>A few negatives (mostly the webcam) but enough significant improvements that this MBA is really a no-brainer for anyone needing a non-power notebook compute, especially if s/he is already in the Apple ecosystem.  Love it so far!</span>

<span>As many others have shared, the Apple MacBook Air M1 is a great laptop. The display is gorgeous. The keyboard is accurate and smooth. Apple has the best trackpads! Battery life is so good that there is no anxiety over having enough power to finish the day.<br/><br/>The setup experience is so good with Apple products. All I had to do was choose my language and connect to wi-fi and then moments later the laptop was ready for me to login.<br/><br/>The laptop integrates so well with the other Apple devices. Although I wonder why it wanted my iPhone's lock screen passcode. I am not sure how secure I feel that my iPhone's lock screen password is shared over the air with the laptop... Otherwise the MacBook Air is a great device for consuming content and for light-creative work.</span>
