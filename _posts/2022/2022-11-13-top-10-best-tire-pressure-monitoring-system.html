<span>Embarked on my first long adventure in my fifth wheel. Read a lot about tire safety and decided to purchase and install a four sensor unit. On day one 6 hours in to our trip we had an alert of rapid air pressure loss. I was able to pull over before a catastrophic tire blowout. I was impressed on how quickly the leak was detected. The air was still hissing out of my tire at a full stop. I’m sure that without TireMinder installed my trip would have been ruined. It literally has paid for itself two fold. Highly recommend. “Happy Camper”</span>

<span>A little pricey, but well worth the purchase.  This kit will allow you to monitor four tires, but you can expand to many more.  I use the TPMS on my trailer tandems and so far the accuracy for both psi and temperature has been accurate.  I had an alarm go off one time because my tire transitioned from a hot surface onto wet pavement.  The alarm showed the psi was dropping but that was due to the quick temperature change as the tires cooled.  Now I know the unit definitely works.<br/><br/>TireMinder has another product that goes up to 80 psi.  If your tires are rated for 80 psi and above, then buy this product so you can monitor whether your tires are getting too over pressurized due to heat.<br/><br/>My only nitpick is having to have a repeater hanging behind my RV battery.  Seems you need the repeater even for short to medium sized trailers.  I'd like to see the TireMinder be able to receive a signal from a further distance.  The repeater connects to the battery with alligator clips.  I know the current draw is low, but I still have to disconnect  it from the battery when I put the RV into into storage. The ability to turn off the repeater without disconnecting it would be a great addition to this product.<br/><br/>Overall, I'd say this is a good product and the bottom line is the product works well.  Two thumbs up and buy.</span>

Unlike cars and SUVs, recreational vehicles don’t typically come equipped with a tire pressure and temperature monitoring system or (TPMS). Not only can this be unsafe, but it’s a hassle to constantly check your tires manually before, during, and after your RVing adventures. With the Tire Linc® TPMS from Lippert™ you can receive tire notifications straight to your phone — keeping you in the know on your tire temperature and pressure, always. Improper pressure cannot only be bad for your tires and vehicle, but it can cause costly and potentially dangerous damage. On average, a blown tire and rim can cost up to $300, and that’s if no other damage or harm has occurred. Tire Linc helps you prevent blowouts by keeping you in the know on your tires.With this system, you can monitor up to 20 tires simultaneously — making this a perfect solution for 5th wheel RVs, travel trailers, towed vehicles, and larger motorhomes. Integrated with Lippert’s OneControl® app, once installed, our TPMS will send you notifications on the status of your tires, directly to your smartphone. Eliminating the need for multiple monitors taking up space on your dashboard. For campers already prepped with a Tire Linc repeater dock, installation is easy. All you have to do is plug your repeater into the dock, screw the Tire Linc sensors onto your existing valves, and connect your system to your OneControl app. From your app, you can set your preferred tire ranges. Pretty simple, right? Just look for the Tire Linc decal to see if your RV has been prepped for Tire Linc.Tire Linc comes equipped with repeater technology that “repeats” the signal your sensors send, but stronger — this way, your smartphone always has the most up-to-date information regardless of where you are. It also includes four sensors and repeater and dock assemblies. Alert Indicator and additional sensors are sold separately. Whether you’re on the road or on the water, Lippert supplies a broad array of premium RV, towing, and marine products designed to enhance all of your recreational pursuits.

<span>I really expected more from Lippert. There are two apps that the modules can pair to, but they are finicky. They don’t stay paired over night for me. It’s really a nose bleed to have another thing to mess with on travel days. I haven’t experienced a low tire yet so I don’t know how the phone app alerts so I cannot comment on that. There is another device available that keeps an eye on things without having to open the app, but it’s another 75.00. It would be nice to have a display that sits on the dash that one could see all the time.</span>

<span>I like being able to do what it was designed to do...  check my tires!  However if i've been away from the link then i have to reconnect.  Initially involved putting in my PIN  (WHY)  i got rid of that...  but if you don't have a connection to the internet I can't 'reconnect' .  This feels more like for "them' than for me.  I wish once i have identified the unit and linked it to my phone that now it will work with my phone via blue tooth only.  Maybe I am missing something but everytime my phone moves out of range, i have to reconnect through internet.  I often camp in areas without cell services therefore the product in those areas is worthless to me.  I have other bluetooth devices (for example TILE key finder) that does not require repeatedly reconnecting with tile.  A bigger frustration to me is i am using this app on my phone.  The data display is so small that i can't see the pressure or temperature readings.  If it gets outside parameters it will turn red... that's good.  Who decided such a small display and why is this not something that can be changed?  The product works but is designed to be used "on grid" and with a large display device.  It is not user friendly.  I have a short trailer and my initial understanding was the booster was only to upgrade the signal from the tire valve sending units.  I didn't think i would need the booster.  The booster is not optional and is required.  You will get to do hard wiring for that.</span>

The sensors send status signals to the monitor on 6-second intervals continuously as long as the sensors are under pressure, so your tires are monitored 24 x 7. Easy operation & maintenance - EezTire TPMS monitor has one of the largest display screen on the market 4 ½” x 3”. It takes minutes to setup and program. The monitor has a built-in rechargeable internal lithium battery that lasts up to 60 hours on a charge. Sensors have replaceable batteries. It comes with a common USB charging cord that can be connected to vehicle’s cigarette lighter or USB port. Multipurpose - TPMS monitor has separate controls for RV and trailer sensors which allows owner to turn off trailer control when driving RV only. The monitor can be programmed with anti-theft sensors or flow-through sensors or different combinations of both sensors to meet the needs of different tires. A booster can be added to boost signal and overcome distance and electromagnetic interference challenges. A basic TPMS system starts with 4 sensors (TPMS4) and could go up to 26 sensors (TPMS26).

<span>Generally set up &amp; installation went well (instruction are OK).  We use them on our Class-A motorhome and the towed vehicle.  Quite often we seem to miss one or more readings on the RVs rear tires (dualies) and when towing our car we usually have to wait several cycles to get those readings &amp; sometimes do not get readings on all 4 (I still need to install the booster though, so might be 'my bad').<br/><br/>I found the 'lock nuts' to be a real pain in the towed car as I check/fill those tires regularly.  I don't mind them on the motorhome though I also have tire pressure equalizers rigged on those and I don't have to adjust the pressure in those tires near as much due to the difference in vehicle usage.<br/><br/>Not sure if the tire caps that have a 'fill thru' valve would have been a better choice for the car but I'll use what I have since I was a bit concerned with the extra size/weight of those.</span>

<span>This does now give me the peace of mind that my tires are properly inflated.  If you want it to the app will send you a notification if your pressures are low which is nice.  Only a couple downsides:  I had to change my 90 degree valve stem to a straight (which they provide in the kit) because it was hitting my caliper on the front wheel (14' FJR).  I was however able to retain the rear 90 degree valve stem.  The other issue is having to remove this cap every time you add air, its not the end of the world but because it has a locking nut on the backside you will need the special tool they provide to do this.  Make sure you keep that tool on the bike at all times.  Other than that I can't say much more, it does monitor your pressures as advertised.</span>

<span>Installation was easy, following the on-screen instructions. The pressure readings were spot on too. These were installed on a Honda Shadow 750 Aero and fit perfectly, with no clearance issues.<br/><br/>The only hiccups in my case were with a firmware upgrade the app alerted me to and both brand new batteries needing to be replaced.<br/><br/>On the firmware upgrade:  I followed the instructions and it upgraded, but then the app complained it lost connection and reported it failed to upgrade. The app advised to try again but then complained the battery was below 3v and advised me to replace the battery before the firmware upgrade could continue, even if the upgrade seemed to succeed.  This happened on BOTH units.<br/><br/>I reached out to FOBO and they confirmed the firmware upgrade succeeded on both units and acknowledged there is a bug in the app that would be fixed in the next few days.<br/><br/>Both brand new batteries are reading 2.97 volts now, below the threshold to do a firmware upgrade.  Luckily, they included a second set of batteries in the box! (Not installed yet)<br/><br/>On the low battery issue, they wrote:<br/><br/>Please note, Battery life span up to 1 year is an estimate based on normal use at 23 C. Battery life may vary according to usage and climatic temperature and brands, <br/>Battery life span will change due to the following reasons:<br/><br/>1) Frequent change of pressure threshold setting in the App.<br/>2) Disabling &amp; enabling of sensors.<br/>3) Release &amp; pairing.<br/>4) Removal &amp; screw-on of sensors.<br/>5) Operating under extreme cold/hot temperatures.<br/>6) Testing of products.<br/>7) Rotation.<br/>8) Trigger alert or let activated alerts unattended.<br/>9) Multiple removal and screw-on of sensors for equalizing all tire pressures.<br/><br/>All these activities will drain a battery very fast and affect the battery life span.<br/>We recommend continuing using FOBO sensors and if suddenly sensor voltage drops unexpectedly then send us a log file of your bike profile by going into App settings, then tap “Feedback” and send to fobo@salutica.com.my.</span>

<span>I installed my A1AS this weekend.  Piece of cake!!!  Much easier than the cheapo unit I had on my old truck/trailer.  I decided to get a quality unit when I got my new trailer.  The old system I had, on my shortbed F-350 pulling a 30’ 5th wheel RV, constantly lost its signal and was difficult to program.  This unit was installed on my longbed F-450 with 46’ triple axle 5th wheel RV and is working great!  Hardest part of the installation was getting the sensors on the valve stems of the inside wheels of the dually!  Thanks for making a great, easy to use, easy to install product!  The app also linked right up.  Good job TireMinder Team!  One tip:  If you have "fill through" valve stem caps, be sure to remove them before installation.  One of the tires kept losing pressure before I took them off.  Glad I found this before getting out on the road!!!</span>

They were very polite, listened well, tried to troubleshoot, but ultimately were unable to fix the problem.<br/>I scoured the internet again, and found mentions of radiofrequency interference with the signal between the sensors and the RTM (radio transceiver module). The most common culprit mentioned were cell phone chargers. I unplugged the cell phone charger and Wow, it worked. Note other devices can also interfere, such as dash cam, radar detector, or GPS.<br/>Hopefully this review will help other buyers, as I suspect others are having the same problem.<br/><br/>To Autel technical support, please be aware of this problem, as it is very frustrating and a quick easy fix.</span>

<span>Best value and arrived quickly. As described it was easy to programm even with my TS408. The build quality is excellent and press-release makes it very easy to install into the wheel without risk of damaging the sensor body.</span>

<span>I had Walmart install these TPMS sensors on my  Ford 2015 F350 , they were by far the cheapest in town to do this. I used the Maxi TPMS tool TS 501, I plugged into the vehicles ECU , used this tool to read the old sensor IDs and then cloned those ID numbers to the new sensors, I  purchased the Motorcraft transmitter TPMS -19 , put the vehicle in the relearn mode and activated the new sensors to the ECU, sounds like a lot, but you only have to buy the tool one time ,you’re set after that. If you buy the OEM sensors from the dealer you’re going to spend over $400 just on those, then you’ll spend another couple hundred for them to install them and program them to the ECU.</span>

<span>This product worked extremely well for me first use. Seamlessly programs two factory tpms sensors on a 2017 Camry with no issue. Also programmed a complete set of sensors to a Tacoma after replacing factory wheels with aftermarket. Again, no issue at all. Would highly recommend this.</span>

<span>I gave it a lesser grade because the cost is rather high.  Also, I had problems with the initial uploads which could have been explained better, and the process made a little simpler.  But there is really no better way to go about keeping your TPMS light off if you run winter/summer tires, and for general maintenance of the vehicle tire monitors. I bought a lesser model only to find out that you cannot reprogram and sync tires to your vehicle system.  That means if you are installing a different set of tires on your vehicle then the ones that are programed to the TPMS system, you need to reprogram the second set to the vehicle. This unit does the job.  And it's quite simple once you learn the system.  Tire shop mechanics use this unit daily so it's probably a little much for me, but then again, I am not waiting in a tire shop twice a year.</span>

<span>Two sensors were a snap(some sensor battery life left), tool read code and loaded on new. Two required typing factory info(printed on dead sensor) into tool then a snap to load on new. All after new sensors mounted  and tires on vehicle.<br/>NOTE! Retain old sensors until finished!</span>
