                   <h4> What People Say:</h4>
<div class="slideshow-container">
<blockquote><em><div class="a-row a-spacing-small review-data"><span class="a-size-base review-text review-text-content" data-hook="review-body">
<span>I've owned three of this model of headset now. They all die from the same exact design flaw. I'm not willing to buy another but if you learn from my mistakes you'll probably enjoy good performance for a long time.<br/>Don't wear them around your neck. That's pretty much it. As you can see from the photo, the plastic framing holding the joint just above the earpiece isn't designed to handle much stress. A lot of the time I leave my headset on the desk when not in use, and that provided a long enough lifespan for me to tell you the good parts:<br/>Call quality is great, I never have any complaints. The noise cancellation (for the wearer) is about a third as good as more expensive headsets or earbuds I've tested, which makes sense as they're about a third the price.<br/>Battery life is pretty good. I can get through a six hour conference call marathon, but it'll leave me using laptop speakers and mic by the end of the day because you can't charge during use.<br/>Comfort is better than par. Anything under 4 hours at a stretch has been no problem for me. I'm relieved to take them off after five or more hours of calls.<br/>Unfortunately I forgot, after maybe nine or ten months, what not to do with this pair. I was up from my desk, getting a coffee, and wore my headphones out of the room in case there was a question that needed my response on the call (there wasn't). When the call ended I lowered the headphones to my neck rather than place them on the kitchen counter.<br/>After grabbing my coffee, heading back to the office I gripped the headphones in one hand, grabbing the center of the headband, and pulled back to take them off my neck. This wasn't a forceful motion at all. I felt only mild pressure from the headphones against my neck, no real discomfort, but sliding them off my neck in this manner was enough to end them.<br/><br/>Like I said, this makes 3 for 3 of this model that died in the same way. The first was a similar story. I grabbed by one ear piece and tried to sort of curve it around the neck to take it off, breaking that same joint. Pair number two lasted the longest. I remembered every time to grab with both hands on the earpiece, every time I took it off my neck, but a few dozen repetitions was too much for that joint by the earpiece. They cracked and broke in the same place, pretty much the same way as you see here. This now makes a third pair of Soundcore Q20 that broke in the same manner through normal use.<br/><br/>If you're confident you'll never wear these on your neck, and you'll only ever gingerly move them on and off your head with both hands holding both earpieces, they're honestly a great performing headset for work calls, good for an audiobook while mowing the lawn or blowing leaves, and not bad for music.<br/><br/>Just don't buy these if you like to hold your headphones on your shoulders, draped around your neck, like many of us do. They can't handle the strain.</span>

<span>First off, this is not a comparison between the Anker Soundcore Q20s and any product from Bose or Sony.. That is an unfair comparison as they are not even in the same ball park.. I know that most people want to get an understanding of how comparable they are to those but if you aren't willing to spend the money on those, you aren't going to get near what they offer..<br/><br/>That being said, for this price range these are the best hands down.. One hit KO.. I'll list all the features separately so they are easy to find and read about.<br/><br/>Active Noise Cancellation:<br/>Let me get some things out of the way, I work at a gas plant in a landfill as IT and Data Reporting.. My job is noisy sometimes.. I hear a constant hum from the motors in the plant right outside my door all day long.. I also travel a lot from the various plants we run.. While ANC is on these headphones won't block out immediate talking next to me or sudden loud noises, but they do block out the noise from the plant.. That is without the music.. I do need to point out that the talking is trying to talk over motors so it's louder than your average office space. When the music is on and running, it adds a whole separate layer to the cancellation as I can no longer hear anything else..<br/><br/>Sound:<br/>I don't typically have music up loud, most I've turned them up to is 50% because I've been rough on my ear drums since I was a kid playing drums at a young age.. As I've gotten older I've been more prone to try and protect my ears.. That being said, the sound quality is very nice with or without ANC engaged.. I find it's way more enjoyable with ANC on due to everything else being tuned out.. Some headphones will warp the sound when ANC is turned on, these do not.. The sound is as impressive with the feature on as it is off.. This is incredible.. I listen to a range of music from Rap and Hip-Hop to Metal and Hard Rock and they all sound clear and precise in these headphones..<br/><br/>They do have a bass-up feature that increases the bass a little more.. This works well without muddying the sound quality too much.. I imagine if you increase the volume too much it might diminish but from my listening around the 50% max it's been outstanding.. Bass gains can be a real hit and miss for me as some lose sound quality.. With these that's not the case..<br/><br/>Quality:<br/>The headphones feel amazing.. They have a nice weight to them (which is not for everyone). I personally like a little weight to my equipment.. It is sturdy and feels solid.. I was afraid of it feeling a little too plastic like but they really don't.. Now they aren't as nice as your $200-$300 headphone, but again, their price range they are amazing quality.. The ear cups are very comfortable and soft memory foam.. I was actually surprised that my ears don't get as hot as normal.. They will overtime due to the design.. It's impossible to get around since it traps heat, but these seem like they don't get as warm as fast.. Also the ear cups feel amazing.. I've literally worn them all day yesterday and felt no ear fatigue or strain.. This is a solid!<br/><br/>Functionality:<br/>A feature that isn't talked about a lot with these is the awesome ability to connect to not just one but two devices simultaneously.. Now a note on that: You cannot listen to two devices at the same time.. What is going on is I'm able to connect to my computer and listen to music on it while being connect to my phone at the same time.. When someone calls me and I answer, it swaps input to my iPhone and stops playing the music in my ears.. Once the call is finished, it swaps back to my computer and I resume listening.. This is an amazing feature that I use daily!<br/><br/>Battery:<br/>The battery is very nice.. When I received my unit the first thing I did was pair it to my devices (of course) and started checking it out.. I received them with 60% battery.. I used them the rest of that day at work for a couple of hours.. then when I left, used them a little more at the house and watched half of a movie on them before going to bed.. They were still at 60%.. The box says that they last 40 hours and that is accurate.. If you don't use the Bass-Up technology you can squeeze even more.. and to not use the ANC it goes up higher.. 40 hours for battery life though is incredible for this price range.. I cannot complain!<br/><br/>Packaging:<br/>The packaging was very nice and well put together.. It came with a charge cable and 3.5mm aux cable (which is great for my Nintendo Switch when I fly).. While I would have loved to seen a USB-C type adapter (as would many others) that is still an expensive change to make and would probably bump the price up out of the $60 range.. I understand from a manufacturing point the reasoning to possibly go with a micro-USB.. It would be nice for C, but it is what it is.. That doesn't change how well this thing is made and works.. The only gripe I have and it's a minor thing is the case they come with.. Well, you can't call it a case cause it's just a bag.. Now, it's a very nice bag, but I throws these buys in a backpack with a laptop and iPad and Switch (in a hardcase) and so a bag doesn't really protect your headphones.. Luckily I had a nice hard case from a cheap pair of headphone I received a few years ago (the case was the nicest part) and they fit perfectly.. So if you don't have one buy a hard case for them..<br/><br/>Overall:<br/>Overall, for the price these are the best hands down.. You really cannot beat their ANC and sound quality for this price.. I will definitely buy these again and probably buy my wife some so she'll stop stealing mine.. If it was out of 10, I'd give this product a 9/10 simply due to no hard shell case..</span>

<span>Normally, Anker products are really good, but these are dissapointing.<br/><br/>If these where just headphones, they would be fine, they are comfortable, sound good (not audiophile good, but good enough), look kinda good (if a tad cluncky). But these are supposed to be noise cancelling headphones. And they do not cancel noise at all.<br/><br/>The only discernible effect when you enable noise cancelling is that the headphones pump up the volume of what you are listening, but, once you compensate for that, the external sound dampening you get is the same that you would get by just the cushions of the headphones.<br/><br/>Mind you, I tested with a punny Nokia E71 playing TMBG's Call_connected_through_the_NSA.mp3 not some hollywood explosion fest. I do not want "world around dissapears" kinds of Noise Cancelling, but if these can't cancel a punny E71... Well, disappointed/dissapointing<br/><br/>Edit #1:<br/>The reason I hold Anker in high regard, I because of their customer service, and this is no exception. I posted the review in about July 18, 2020, and today July 21, 2020 they contacted me. At least we know they still have top notch customer support, even during a pandemic.<br/><br/>Nonetheless, their sugestions were not very usefull:<br/><br/>«- Make sure the NC button is turned on(the NC indicator would turn green) when you want them to cancel noise outside.»<br/>Yes, I know very well how to press the button to get the green light, and also, a very nice lady voice says "Noice Cancelling", so yes, I was 110% (one hundred and ten percent)  sure noice cancelling was active.<br/><br/>«- Try the headphones in different noisy places with NC on and off and see any difference.»<br/>Well, we are under lockdown. When I am able to move out, I have more important thing to do than test noise cancelling headphones. Nonetheless, I'll try to do it and report back to Anker Customer Support, and to you guys. I'll also try to get the 10 min silent MP3s from Samir Mezrahito really test this out.<br/><br/>Edit #2:<br/><br/>I was "finally" able to actuate on Anker product support's sugestion and "- Try the headphones in different noisy places with NC on and off and see any difference.".<br/><br/>For testing purposes I used the headphones in BlueThooth mode (to eliminate any electrical intereference noise). And used the song "A a a a a a a a a Very good song" by artist Samir Mezrahi, which, as you perhaps know, consists of almost 10 min of silence.<br/><br/>I tested in various scenarios:<br/>1.) In my car, windows down.<br/>2.) In my car windows up.<br/>3.) Reving up my car to 2500rpm (in the parking lot).<br/>4.) In a bus stop (with buses comming in and out).<br/>5.) In the electric stairs of a ghostly empty shopping mall.<br/>6.) In a queue to pay for medicines (with ambient music and people talking at moderate volume).<br/>7.) Near the air extractor of my home kitchen.<br/><br/>My results:<br/>1.) If wind blows in the headphones you actually get MUCH MORE noise with NC on than with NC off, so forget using the noise cancelling in a ferry boat, or in a bus with no Air conditioning, or in your car with windows/roof open, or in your bike.<br/>2.) The NC was able to diminish humming noises (like the engine), but not clacking noises, or noises derived from potholes and such.<br/>3.) The NC was very effective at mitiganting the reeving.<br/>4.) The engine noise from the buses was mitigated, but not the clacking or the chatter from the people waiting.<br/>5.) Again, the humm of the motor of the staris was mitigated, but not the clacking noises.<br/>6.) In the queue, the souund of the air conditioner or the store was somewhat mitigated by the NC, but not the ambient music or the chatter, and that actually ended up being worse, because it made more noticeable the music and chatter.<br/>7.) The NC was decent with the air extractor of my kitchen.<br/><br/>But, in scenarios 5, 6 &amp; 7, I noticed that the NC tends to cancel the low frequencies, but the high ones are not mitigated at all (currently at my 47yo, i can hear up to 15Khz, so for younger peiople is probably worse), so, actually enabling NC will make any high pitch noice more noticeable (i.e. the frequency responce of the NC is not flat).<br/><br/>Finally, if one bought these headphones with NC because the noise made by rain, the AC fan or compressor, or some other noise like that was disturbing, it it will diminish it a little (but not much), but if one bought noise cancelling headphones because one wanted to evade the sound of coworkers talking, or kids playing in the garden or your SO watching TV in the other room, these headphones will do nothing  more than what headphones with no NC (and therefore less expensive) would have.<br/><br/>Edit #3 (and Final):<br/><br/>Anker contacted me, and offered two options, return the item (as a very special consideration, since I am a few MONTHS completely outside of the return window), or get a refund for 20% of the cost, to get a more suitable Item. Since I order to the USoA and then have my Items forwarded to Venezuela, it is a hassle to return Items, so I opted for the refund, and it went smoothly.<br/><br/>That is the good thing of going with Anker. The litmus test of a good company comes when things go wrong, and Anker has a stellar reputation for making things right. Upgraded the review from one star to 4, but not on the account of the product itself, but rahter, due to the excellent customer service.</span>

<span>This is a review comparing these headphones to the Bose Quietcomfort 35 II, and the Sony WH-1000XM4.<br/><br/>Now I know what your thinking - how could you ever compare a cheapo $50 pair of headphones to the $300+ big boys in the noise cancelling world like Bose and Sony? Well these headphones are wireless, bluetooth, active noise cancelling, and promote themselves as comfortable with balanced sound, so in my book all three of these headphones are in the same league.<br/><br/>The criteria is simple - I don't use lab equipment to measure, I'm not concerned about exact numbers, and I don't like falling for overblown hype or marketing nonsense. I use my own experience and non-technical knowledge to decide what I like best.<br/><br/>The Soundcore Headphones:<br/>These headphones are comfortable. Maybe it's because of the 'cheaper' materials, or they are just genuinely made with comfort more in mind, but I can wear these all day with little discomfort. I wear glasses so a little annoyance is unavoidable, but these do a bang up job of not squishing my head, while still making a good seal around my ears to keep sound quality and noise cancelling from bleeding out. I have heard some having issues with durability, but my bose quietcomfort headphones wore out and cracked over time too. Replacements are plentiful and cheap, so it's a non issue for me.<br/><br/>Comparability and Software:<br/>These are what headphones are meant to be. Simple buttons, simple pairing, no proprietary software that I have to download, no nonsense. Just pair and play. They also have a wired mode if I'm editing video or need them to not have any delay. Bluetooth will always have a bit of a delay, but it's nothing deal breaking, a few milliseconds at most. They do not have multidevice pairing, or absolutely massive bluetooth range (it still works perfectly for me going around my whole house no problem), and there is no EQ balancing, other than the Bass Boost.<br/><br/>Overall Sound<br/>I'm not a pro audio engineer or audiophile. If it sounds good, it's good to me. I like these headphones in normal mode just fine. While the overall sound stage is fairly tight, and it can sometimes feel cramped with complex or intricate songs, I don't feel overwhelmed in any one way or another. The negative I have here is with their 'bass boost's mode. It's fair to say it does boost the bass, at the cost of literally everything else. It almost makes it sound like every other frequency is underwater when it's turned on. I keep it off 100% of the time - it's bad.<br/><br/>Noise Cancelling:<br/>Here is the meat and potatoes of the review. I bought these for noise cancelling and noise cancelling alone. I was surprised - they are pretty good. My air conditioner dissolves away. Car noises and wind fade to imperceptible levels, and airplane sounds go completely away. The area it falls short in is human speech. I can still hear people without much difference. Not a killer for me, but slightly lacking in that regard. They also do not give me the headache compression feeling that some other noise cancelling can give me.<br/><br/>Comparisons:<br/><br/>Comfort - These surprisingly win. The Bose Quietcomforts are very close, but the headpeice is slightly tighter, leading to overall head pressure discomfort over time. The Sonys are even worse, with their high weight and size they can feel heavy over time, and make my ears warm after about 1 hour.<br/><br/>Compatibility and Software - These are also the winners! Sony and Bose just cannot help themselves when it comes to collecting data and making their customers sign up for BS accounts. I'm not a super privacy nerd either, but when I have to take a photo of my ears (looking at you Sony!) Just to listen to music, I draw the line. The Quietcomforts are better, but the Bose app is just another step in between me and my music. Bose at least keeps the physical buttons, which I enjoy because touch controls are still a bit picky in 2020. Sony knows this well, as I fumbled and accidentally turned off my music or changed the volume or song accidentally about a dozen times on their headphones. Physical buttons are arguably uglier, but I value practicality over style in this regard. The Sonys also have multidevice pairing, and their bluetooth range is just stupid far, but I don't usually run a whole football field away from my phone at a time.<br/><br/>Overall Sound - Sony comes first, followed by Bose, and then the Soundcores. The Sony headphones are very crisp, with a wide sense of space. I genuinely couldnt stop myself from smiling when I first put them on. They induce a sense of awe, and I loved their sound immensely. The Bose was slightly worse, and only a touch better than the Soundcores. Bose has cleaner bass, and a better sense of staging, especially with singing and high hat sounds. If I were to number them by sound the Sonys get a 96, the Bose a 85, and the Soundcores a 82.<br/><br/>Noise Cancelling - Sony once again wins, but this time the Bose and Soundcores are tied. I genuinely could not tell the difference between the Bose and Soundcores when my eyes were closed as far as noise cancelling was concered. The Sonys I could though. They do a significant better job with human voices, especially crowds like in restaurants or outside. They are still audible, but pass the point where I cannot understand what people are saying - the Bose and Soundcores fail this test.<br/><br/>The Overall:<br/>Comparing these headphones is an excercise in diminishing returns. For $50 the Soundcores cover about 90% of what the $300 Bose Quietcomforts offer, and about 85% of what the $350 Sony WH-1000XM4 offer. To me, that remaining 10% and 15% does not justify the additional $250 and $300 price tag. Now maybe you're the kind of person who absolutely has to have the best noise cancelling, or can't live without the absolute cream of the crop perfect soundscape - and in those instances the features may justify the cost. But chances are if you're debating on these headphones you are just the average Joe consumer like me, in which case these headphones will cover everything you need without bogging you down in unnecessary features or quality thay will go unnoticed in 99% of the population. I genuinely like these headphones, and will continue to lovingly give them daily abuse until they fail me. After all, I could buy and break FIVE of these before I reached the price of one pair of Sonys.<br/><br/>TL:DR Give them a chance, you'll more than likely find their value apparent.</span>

<span>These headphones offer great hearing protection. I used to practice the drums with a regular pair of earbuds in, and I could sense that it was damaging my hearing. Sometimes I would use musician's earplugs, but those aren't great if you're trying to play along to something. That was my motivation for getting these headphones, and I haven't looked back since. I have had them a little over a year and I use them every day.<br/><br/>The sound quality is decent. In my opinion, these are ear protection and the fact that you can listen to music through them is a bonus feature. They're great for playing along to something on the drums, but I wouldn't recommend them as 'listening headphones'.<br/><br/>They look pretty cool compared to other ear protection, so I guess that's a plus.<br/><br/>My one complaint is that they are uncomfortable to wear for long periods. I usually take a 2 minute break after every 20 minutes of practicing because of this. You could probably get around this by putting some foam on the headband, but it doesn't bother me enough to want to put in the effort.<br/><br/>Overall I'd highly recommend these to any drummer, even in light of the discomfort issue.</span>

<span>These are very comfortable and sound great! The noise canceling to me isn't that great but they do block out most of the surrounding sounds/noises. I've heard other brands (Bose) and a few others that are really good at noise canceling but for the money I can't really complain. They're really for the price! Definitely recommend! Great sticks and and great headset! 👍🏼</span>

<span>Super Hi-fidelity they are not, but they still are well in the good range, especially for what are intended for, that is protecting an acoustic drummer's ears while still providing for an enjoyable playing experience. They do fit tightly, which I have to believe is good for isolation, but you will know they are on your head.  These are NOT active noise cancelling, but rather passive noise isolating. You can still read the drums acoustically through the cones, but I find that adding just a bit from the drum mics in the monitor mix brings out more of the clarity and richness of the kit.  Still, there is enough of the drums reading through that it would be very reasonable (in my opinion) to play just hearing them passively through the cones, at least playing inside an enclosed cage. Bottom line, I was surprised by how much I liked these, especially for the relative cost.</span>

<span>Ps. I am reviewing these headphones in context to the price point, and will not compare them to lets to name brands costing much  more, this review will not be fair, lets judge them for the price you are paying.<br/><br/>Can I surely get a decent headphones for such a low price with all the features like Bluetooth, noise cancellation, decent sound quality, battery life and built quality? I was browsing for budget price point over the ear headphones, and ran into these with a decent amount of reviews suggesting these are much more than what the price suggest, was curious, why not lets try it!<br/><br/>Most of my gear is in-ear units costing couple times over the price of these; this gives me a good reference point.<br/><br/>Sound Quality:<br/>-Right off the bat over the ear sound fuller, with better bass due to the 40mm drivers, where there is bass these units lack the crispness I get with in-ear, its good enough for most music though (great for Jazz, Pop, Rock), somewhat lacking in Classical music where nuances are a key. Soundstage is good, balanced and you feel in the music. Noticed that the sound quality was a little better when wired compared to  Bluetooth ( by the way Bluetooth worked as expected, found and pared every time, typical range was about 400 feet)<br/><br/>Comfort/Build Quality:<br/>-Solid non crackly plastics, good hinges.. Very good cushy cups, comfortable for wearing them over extended period of time, although I would not recommend them laying in bed. Even decent for jogging – staying put. Control buttons are tactile, decent click feedback, wish the buttons were bigger.<br/><br/>Sound Isolation:<br/>-Very surprised how these units isolate you form the outside ambience. Cups are snug, and the active noise cancellation does a good job with outside ambience. Have a in-window air conditioner, with active noise cancellation I can barely hear the AC, that hum is very similar to airplane noise, expecting good cancellation in flight. For those who never experienced noise cancellation, let me say that it makes music pop-out more without distraction, imagine trying to focus on a song and at the same time someone is babbling in your ear, its distracting, right? Noise cancellation is wonderful in that regard, try it!<br/><br/>Battery Life/Accessories<br/>-Fully charged took about 3 hours, and you basically forget to recharge again, it claims 30+ hours, I believe it. I usually plug in via cable for better sound so the battery life increases significantly. Accessories are typical, a leatherette pouch for storage, 3.5mm jack cable, and even a airplane audio adapted. Most over the ear units come with these accessories so that was expected.<br/><br/>Was pleasantly surprised that for so little you get so much, a good sound quality, with the comfort and isolation, good build quality, all the accessories that  will give one enjoyment for years to come!</span>

<span>I was looking for the best headphones along with the noise cancellation feature at the minimum price then I found the Bopmen headphones on amazon with all the features that I was looking for.  I immediately bought them and now I use them all the time. These sit very comfortably on my head while I am teaching to my students online or to take online interviews with my business employee. I don’t have a particularly large head and they fit nicely, but I imagine they would be better for someone with a big noggin. The noise-canceling is very decent. It’s not Bose quality but it’s plenty powerful to muffle a mower, vacuum, or grinder. It almost entirely mutes plane noise. Once again it is very great headphones according to its costs and comes with charging cable and runs for an average of 20 hours. I am very satisfied with these headphones and would like to recommend to all those people who are in search of very decent, good quality, wireless, noise cancellation headphones at a cheaper cost.</span>

<span>I bought these when my old headphones went out.  I'd had my previous pair for going on five years.  I know, unheard of.  I just wanted a pair that were noise cancelling, wireless and had a long charge life.  These delivered and then some!  These cancel alllll the noise, EVER!  When I have them on, I cannot hear anything outside of what's playing in my ears.  I tested the theory with my two toddler nephews, Baby Shark and Paw Patrol and a 15 year old on his PS.  These headphones blocked it all!  They are very comfortable, the sound quality is awesome and the mic is crystal clear.  I easily connected them to my phone, iPad and laptop.  I'm impressed.  May buy a pair for my office.</span>

<span>These headphones are great for watching movies, listening to music, completing online training classes or anywhere else you are not required to talk. However, the deep bass they mention is lacking. Unfortunately using these headphones during a phone call, Zoom call, WebEx, etc. are lacking as microphone quality is lacking and impacts the ability for the remote side to hear you. On two occasions, during a zoom conference, I asked if everyone could hear me and was told by multiple individuals that it sounded really muffled and hard to hear.<br/><br/>If you just want these to just listen, then by all mean purchase as they are great for that but if you plan on using during conference calls, online classes, etc. where you must speak find something better.</span>

<span>*Introduction:<br/><br/>I bought the Bose NC 700 right around the new year in 2021, so about a month ago. Like many people, I've been working from home for the past year. However, I have 2 young children who can get noisy, so I wanted some noise cancelling headphones. Also, I like listening to music and gaming, so I'll address that as well. Here is my review, broken down by subject:<br/><br/>*Noise Cancelling:<br/><br/>When I set out to get a pair of noise cancelling headphones, my main priority was, of course, noise cancelling. Naturally, I gravitated towards Bose due to their fantastic history here. I have never owned a pair of active noise cancelling headphones before, so I can't really compare to anything. However, I can say they are amazing. Any low-frequency constant noise is basically gone. I have a small office room with 2 central air registers; I can't hear either of them with the headphones on. I can hear my kids when they are loud, but the "punch" is gone, and it feels like it takes a level 10 crying baby, down to a level 7. All of this is without music on. Turn any music on, and it becomes near impossible to hear anything. I mean it; turn on some rock or rap and kiss noise goodbye. I'm sure the offerings from other companies are great too, but these are wonderful at noise cancelling.<br/><br/>*Sound Quality:<br/><br/>Sound quality is difficult to measure as it's subjective, so I'll try my best. I think the Bose NC 700's sound quality is pheromonal. I can hear lots of fine detail, and nothing has ever felt clipped or muddy, unless the music itself is. I personally really like the sound signature (think how the headphones are tuned, not how "good" they are), but a lot of people want more bass. Keep in mind, these do have good bass, but they won't turn your brain to mush.  I am not a bass lover, so these are great for me. I typically stream Spotify from my computer or phone at the highest quality setting and set the app's EQ (see below for more info) to low = 0, mid = 2, high = 5. So, if you really want bass, I would try the Sony XM4's, but these sound really good and clear.<br/><br/>*Design / Comfort:<br/><br/>This is probably the trickiest for me to review. I’ll start with looks. I think they look cool and different from other headphones. They have a good amount of adjustability and feel pretty solid. They have 3 physical buttons: a noise cancellation level button, and voice assistant button, and a Bluetooth pairing / power button. However, I do not like the silicone headband. It feels cheap (to me at least) and isn’t overly comfortable. It doesn’t hurt, but it doesn’t feel good. Same goes for the leatherette ear cups. They’re fine, but do not feel premium. For nearly $400 I want something more luxurious.  As a quick aside I’m 6’ 4” and wear glasses. After 6 ish hours wearing these off and on the tops of my ears where my glasses sit starts to hurt. The clamping force (for me) is a bit tight. You can reduce the clamping force by extending the earcups, but for my head it makes the earcups be too low, and that’s not comfortable either. It’s not a terrible thing, but I’m usually happy to take them off at the end of the day. That’s still almost a full work day’s time which is pretty good.<br/><br/>*Battery life:<br/><br/>They are advertised for 20 hours, I’m not sure how much time I actually get but it sounds about right. I usually charge them every other day or every 2 days. I like the battery is measured in hours rather than percentage. Since I don’t travel this isn’t a big deal anyways, but you can get better battery life from other headphones.<br/><br/>*Touch controls:<br/><br/>Touch controls work fine for me. I think this comes down to preference. I’ve had no trouble getting used to them, even swiping up/down for volume. Somehow the volume swipe considers your speed or force to change how much you adjust volume per swipe. A full swipe up / down is about 25/30% in windows.<br/><br/>*Bose Music App:<br/><br/>This section (and the next) is where my review goes off a cliff. I hate the app. When I first got the headphones, the “simple” paring that the little user pamphlet outlined didn’t work. I had to manually pair through my phone. When pairing with my windows 10 laptop, I initially couldn’t get it to work at all. I had to find this post: Steps to pair NC 700 headphones with Windows 10 - Bose Community - 293028 to get it to work. Also, my headphones came uncharged. Between the lack of charge and Bluetooth issues it took about 30-45 minutes before I first heard anything with the headphones.<br/><br/>Sometimes, when you open to music app to change to EQ or something else, your headphones will not be detected. The only solution I’ve found so far is to reboot. This is extremely annoying since it takes about 10-15 seconds to reboot your headphones (see below for why that is).<br/><br/>Another annoyance is that the self-voice level option for when you’re in headset mode is buried withing the app settings. This should be part of the initial settings when you first open the app. You also cannot map it to a tap combo short cut. I would love to be able to do that since I’m adjusting all the time due to my surrounding sound levels when I’m on a call.<br/><br/>1 Last thing, and I wasn’t sure whether to put this in the app or headphone software section. You cannot disable the multiple Bluetooth connection feature. Are you on a zoom meeting on your laptop and you get a call on your phone? Guess what, your audio, both input and output, automatically switch to the phone ringing in your ears. Listening to Spotify on your phone and then the windows chime plays? The windows chime interrupts your music. Even if your windows volume is muted, the audio switch to no sound for the duration of the windows chime. This wouldn’t be a problem, if you could disable the feature. You could unpair and repair devices manually, but if you unpair your phone where the music app is installed, the music app will “forget” the device and you have to go through the setup process again for a new device. It’s mind-boggling stupid and I can’t believe this app made it to market as is. For reference I have a One Plus 6T. Related to this, I’ve never had a successful switch from computer to phone when a call comes in. I can hear the ringing initially, but not the caller once I accept the call. Also, they cannot hear me at all.<br/><br/>*Headphone Software:<br/><br/>The headphone’s software itself is annoying. Not quite as bad as the app, but far from good. Upon startup, the headphone’s voice will tell you the amount of battery you have left and the 2 devices you’re currently connected to. At first this didn’t bug me, but after a while, it is extremely annoying. Most of the time, I know what devices I’ll be connected to. Just let it be a triple tap shortcut or something similar.<br/><br/>Also, there are definite problems somewhere along the chain of input microphone processing. Often my colleagues say I’m cutting in and out when I talk in lower tones. This usually occurs when the central air is running, and it’s input noise canceling is running. As far as I know, there’s no way to reduce or turn off the input noise cancelling. This is frustrating, since one of the selling points for these headphones is good mic quality. It’s very disappointing.<br/><br/>*Summary:<br/><br/>In summary the headphones sound great, but the day to day software issues make these a hard pass at $400. I don’t have the Sony XM4’s or other competitors for comparison, but I cannot recommend against these headphones enough. This will be the first and last Bose product I will own for a long time.</span>

<span>I left a lengthy review comparing the Jabra Evolve2 85 (E285) vs Bose Quiet Comfort 35 II (QC35II) vs Bose Noise Cancelling 700 (B700) vs Sony WH-1000XM4 (SX4) (in order of when I received them) for the E285. With the full review there, I'll keep this one more focused on N700 vs E285. This was almost entirely written up during the week I had all four headsets for direct comparisons.<br/><br/>Microphone and Playback<br/>The B700 was not tested because there were enough other reasons not to even consider them. Win for E285. Runner up is SX4.<br/><br/>Audio Output - DISCLAIMER - I'm not an audiophile<br/>E285 and SX4 audio sound better than the QC35II but primarily because I can use an equalizer and increase bass (obviously this is the most important factor). I couldn’t get the “thump” from the B700 no matter what I tried. The B700 does have an EQ, but it’s far more basic than what Jabra and Sony offer, like a ball point pen vs a fountain pen. Sure, the ball point will get the message across, but one can’t deny the fountain pen its grace as it glides like butter across the page, leaving streaks of variable line widths and drawing you in –sorry, wrong review. Win for SX4. Runner up is E285.<br/><br/>Brand<br/>Bose: wanted my location and would ask for it every time I open the app (and wouldn’t allow usage without accepting beyond the standard Bluetooth connection process). These are headphones. You don’t need my location. There are two different apps and both suck, but the one for B700 is especially awful (Bose Music). Just the first time using the app for setup, it crashed. It periodically failed to detect the headphones, even after the latest firmware instalment. It’s worth mentioning the Bose Music app is far worse than the other Bose app (QC35II uses Bose Connect). I had far too many connectivity issues within the first hour to justify keeping the B700 (yes, I requested a return within an hour).<br/><br/>Jabra: doesn’t require my location. Instead, it lets me know if I desire to give it my location, it will use it to locate my headphones. No, but thank you for giving me an actual choice!<br/><br/>ANC<br/>When playing on a drumpad, the E285 did a noticeably better job than the other headsets. It sounds like the pad is being muffled (which is what I’m looking for), whereas the others don’t quite succeed. Again, B700 was not put through this test because it sucks.<br/><br/>In addition, the hear-through function of the E285 is awesome. The E285 hear-through, which has adjustable levels, almost makes it sound like you’re not wearing them (tested at maximum hear-through). Win for E285. Runner up is SX4.<br/><br/>Connectivity<br/>The E285 and SX4 have longer ranges than the QC35II. The E285, most of the time, reconnects automatically when coming back into range. QC35II, SX4, and E285 have a 3.5 mm jack. Why doesn’t the B700? Because it sucks.<br/><br/>Double-connection to my PC (independent of range): E285 is easier because it’s just plug-and-play, no downloads or “connecting”. Didn’t bother trying the B700 because of the numerous issues with just one connected device. An added feature of the Jabra is Jabra Direct, a software you can download to better manage your Jabra. It gives you a few more options and is worth using, in this writer’s humble opinion.<br/><br/>Response time: the QC35II and B700 have a slightly faster response time when pausing media than the E285. The SX4 is the fastest, though we’re talking minute (not 60 seconds) differences. The E285 is on the cusp of being slow enough to be annoying, but not quite. The E285 and SX4 also have the cool feature of pausing media when the headphones are removed from your skull. Put succinctly, the E285 needs work, especially when using it with the PC. But at least it has it!<br/><br/>App connectivity: some issues with E285. Some issues with SX4. Some issues with QC35II (Bose Connect). LOTS of issues with B700 (Bose Music). Unfortunately, apps are prone to some bugs every now and then; unless you’re Bose Music, in which case you’re a swarm of locusts after a century rest furiously attacking unsuspecting victims taking what was supposed to be a nice meander down the side of the Nile River. Does it remind you of a curse? It should. I succumbed to believing the $400 I used to purchase them came from the time I was standing on a burial ground when my check came through my account. I can’t say which of the two (Sony/Jabra) had more, so neither bothered me much. Winner is SX4 (better media response time). Runner up is E285.<br/><br/>Voice Assistant<br/>Couldn’t even get B700 to work. First off, I have to change the “action” button from ANC control to activate voice assistant (so you can’t have both functionalities at the same time). However, once button mapping was adjusted accordingly, I click the button and it says “open your Google Assistant settings”, with no further instructions. I open the Home app, and once again, no further instructions, so I didn’t get it working. I didn’t spend anymore time on it because in contrast, the E285 and SX4 worked exactly as expected. No setup or anything, I just pushed the button and my assistant came up. The caveat for the E285 is you have to pull down the boom arm to use the feature. Perhaps Bose has better functionality when used with Alexa, but I use Google so I’m not bothering with testing that. Tie between E285 and SX4.<br/><br/>I know this is extremely nit-picky, but the Bose assistant’s voice is far more annoying than Jabra or Sony. She sounds like an actual robot as opposed to someone I wouldn't mind meeting.<br/><br/>Controls<br/>On the E285, the buttons take up little surface area and are rather flat. After just a little use of the “touchless” controls (B700 and SX4), I can see their usefulness. It’s certainly easier to play/pause music and use the Voice Assistant (which is no easier to actually setup because Bose sucks). Changing volume is annoying because every click up/down requires an extra swipe. As debilitating as this is, one would not likely be changing by a bunch of increments at a time. Between the B700 and SX4, I found the pole in the B700 to be much more in the way and therefore the SX4 provides better usability. After more use of the touchless controls, I much prefer the them over the physical ones. Win for SX4. Runner up is E285.<br/><br/>Comfort and Style<br/>While the B700 has the tightest grip, it actually slides off the easiest, I guess because the top band is the slimmest of the pickings. Also, it’s far easier to accidentally move the ear cups because they’re really loosely attached to their sliding pole. Win for QC35II. Runner up is E285/SX4 (just as comfortable). Don't care to spend time rating the B700.<br/><br/>Extra<br/>The E285 has the hear-through feature, which I really like because I use ANC only when there are sounds I actively don’t want to listen to, like from mine or my roommate’s drumming, running water, laundry, phone call, or pooping with the fan on. Other than those times, I want some awareness of my surroundings because there’s nothing more frustrating than trying to get the attention of someone with headphones on (especially at work). In addition, the E285 and SX4 have ear detection (discussed previously). The E285 has a great way of handling multiple calls with its huge button on the right cuff. You can switch between two phone calls by putting one on hold and accept/end/reject calls using it. This is RARELY used, but it's cool.<br/><br/>Issues<br/>B700: flat out sucks with just ONE connection. I’m constantly having to manually re-connect, and not just a simple “re-connect”; I mean force-stopping the app, forgetting the headset from my phone and vice-versa, holding down the Bluetooth button to make the app realize it’s there, allowing my phone to pair, etc. Over and over. Can’t imagine the issues I’d be having if I set it up with two devices.<br/><br/>There’s some variability with the Google Assistant functionality with the E285. At the very least, the action button on the arm activates the assistant. But sometimes the input for said assistant is on the phone rather than the arm. Most of the time it works as expected. I think the additional connection to the PC adds complexity that needs to be vetted out for seamless functionality for the E285.<br/><br/>Final verdict, best to worst: E285, SX4 (killer - no mute function, worse hear-through), QC35II (killers - older BT connection, worse audio, poor ANC). Literally wouldn't buy B700.<br/><br/>UPDATE: It's been several weeks since I returned all but the Jabra Evolve2 85 (I use it 3-10 hours every single day) and my final rating is four stars while I give the B700 one star. When the E285 works, it's great. But it doesn't work all the time, unfortunately. But the B700 was far more aggravating and there was no comparison between it and the other three headphones. Also, Bose REQUIRES your location, which is extremely stupid. They're headphones, you don't need my location. While I ultimately ended up with the E285, if muting yourself directly from your headset isn't important to you and you're not typically in a noisy environment during calls, then I would honestly recommend the Sony WH-1000XM4.</span>

<span>This review is my personal experience using both headphones.  I recently lost my Sony Headphones and decided to buy Bose Headphones.  Here are some differences I have found between all three, and how I feel currently using Bose Headphones.<br/><br/>Make sure you update any headphones firmware, some issues you may experience could be fixed (with any electronic).  Understand that headphones in a warehouse are likely from the year they were manufactured, and first versions of anything tend to be buggy.<br/><br/>PERSONAL USAGE<br/>I use these headphones primarily for work.  I’ve been full time remote for over two years doing software development.  I have ADHD and having noise cancelling headphones is a must to keep my attention on work.  We use mostly Slack and Zoom as our means of communication.  Otherwise, I’m listening to music or the occasional YouTube TV.<br/><br/>PERSONAL PREFERENCES<br/>I really don’t like using in the ear headphones.  They hurt my ears after an hour or so and never were a long-term solution.  Over the ear headphones was what I liked the best since that’s what works for me.  This has been throughout my life, and they tend to fall out.<br/><br/>BEATS – NOT FOR ME OR MY HEAD<br/>My first pair of headphones were Beats Solo.  I was really impressed with wireless headphones in general.  Eventually after the Solos started to fall apart, I decided to get Beats Studio 3.  These worked much better for my head, as these were truly over my year, which I prefer.<br/><br/>The functionality is about the same between the two.  With a lot of usage, the earpieces came worn out and unglued and I had to buy replacements.  Compatible quality replacements are about $30 from different manufacturers.<br/><br/>• Pros – Lots of colors.  Foldable, and buttons are more clicks than touch sensitivity.  Useful when sweating or outdoor use.<br/>• Cons – Quality.  Wore down quickly and were not a long-term solution.  Paying more for royalties to Dr. Dre than quality assurance in general.  Feel cheap.<br/><br/>FIRST DECISION – Sony WH-1000MX3<br/>I was fortunate to try out both headphones from a family member.  I was skeptical about Sony since it wasn’t the name brand Bose was for what I wanted.  I really like how they felt on my head, and they didn’t hurt after wearing them for hours.<br/><br/>There wasn’t a noticeable difference in sound quality.  Features needed matched what I needed at the time and figured there was no point in spending more.  My work-at-home situation was different, and I was at home around 40% of the time.  The case was useful when transporting in my backpack back and forth to work.<br/><br/>Once I transitioned to full time work-at-home, some of the features that I found useful weren’t available on the Sony’s.  One big thing I would like to see is app integration.  Mute / Unmute for Slack and Zoom would really be a great feature.  Understandably, these are headphones, and are limited to what Bluetooth has to offer.<br/><br/>The app is useful, and more powerful with customization than the other two.  I found I used it a couple of times.<br/><br/>Over the three years I’ve used these, the product quality and sound we’re just like day 1.  These headphones seem to be built better than the other two.<br/><br/>• Pros –Very durable and well built.  Sound quality is great and felt good after a day’s work.  Slept with these on a bus trip.  That was my last memory.  Cheaper than the Bose.  Foldable, smaller case.<br/>• Cons – Less features than the Bose.  Misses on some sweet spots.  Harder to see which is left and right when putting them on, but not really a big deal.<br/><br/>SECOND DECISION – Bose Noise Cancelling Headphones 700<br/><br/>Once I realized I may never see my beloved Sony Headphones again, I needed something right away since work call quality was terrible.  Before I pulled the trigger on the same Sony’s, I wanted to look at to what Bose offered that Sony didn’t.  The biggest was a feature to mute / unmute.  When pouring over reviews like this one, that feature was worth paying up.  Since these are new headphones, I am still getting used to the controls.<br/><br/>I’ve only had these for a month.  Was it worth paying up for it?  Honestly, I don’t know yet.  There are more controls on the headphones which I’m figuring out.<br/>So based on a month, here’s what I found<br/>• Pros – Seems like better sound quality.  More features and possible mute integration.<br/>• Cons – Price and unproven personal durability experience.<br/><br/>TLDR / OVERALL REVIEW<br/>I won’t even compare the Beats headphones.  Sony and Bose are a step way above Beats.<br/>METRICS<br/>• Sound Quality – Bose slightly.  My ears are bad, I’m not an audiophobia as others may be.  Spotify is what I listen to primarily.  The slight edge goes to Bose, only because it’s a small enough difference.<br/>• Mute / Unmute – Bose.  The main reason for choosing Bose instead of Sony for my current headphones.<br/>• Noise Cancelling – Leaning towards Bose.  There is customization of three different settings within the Bose app to set up preferences from 0-10.  Sony sort of has the same thing, but not directly.<br/>• Microphone – Sony.  Never had any issues of cutting out or “robo voice”.  Initially I am “cutting out” and “in a wind tunnel” from peers.<br/>• Bose - Multiple Device Connectivity (multiple Bluetooth Connections) was a feature I didn’t even think about.  Bose allows for multiple connections which comes in handy.  I found myself unpairing and pairing devices with Sony.  It was sort of a hassle that seemed unnecessary.  If the Bluetooth source device is off, it should default to another.<br/>• Headset Features, Bose wins.  Although I haven’t had the time to get into what the buttons do, there are more of them.  The buttons themselves seem a little better than the Sony’s.<br/>• Headset Quality – Sony.  I really don’t care for the artsy plastic that goes over the top of your head.  Sony also folds up where Bose doesn’t.  An argument can be made that the Bose are lighter than the Sony’s, but that didn’t matter to me.<br/>• In the box – Sony slightly.  Sony included an airplane adapter where Bose did not.  I prefer the case from Sony than I do from Bose.<br/>• Daily Use – Too Early to determine, likely Sony.  Sony’s headphones were excellent, as of now I haven’t used the Bose headphones.<br/>• Bluetooth Range – Bose decisively.  Bluetooth location hasn’t changed.  Dead spots where I wore my Sony’s didn’t exist with the Bose. There is a little bit of breakup in the headphones in dead spots, but nearly not as much as the Sony’s.<br/>• Companion Application – Bose.  Much more customization of buttons versus Sony.<br/><br/>WINNER – Sony<br/><br/>I’m going to put a disclaimer on this, so take this for what it is.<br/>With my new set of Bose Headphones, there is a problem with the microphone.  Assuming that this was just a fluke, I returned them since they were defective.  So, my review is irrelevant of that from that aspect.<br/><br/>Both are great, I lean Sony just because of the price difference.<br/><br/>I wanted to give the Bose Headphones a little more time before getting a refund and getting the Sony’s again.  Right now, they’re cutting out where Sony rarely did that.  Even in that case, my computer was slow, or the application used went haywire.  That’s something that’s a no-go for me.  I ended up contacting Bose support, went through the normal stuff, is your battery charged, are you far away to a point they created a return ticket for a replacement.  Once sent in, they would give me a new pair within 5 business days.<br/><br/>Fortunately, after writing this review, I ended up finding my missing Sony headphones, which would be what I would have bought instead of a Bose replacement.<br/><br/>As with any review, only you can decide if the extra money for Bose is worth it.  I can see it both ways.  For me, these headphones are for basic usage.  The extra money wasn’t worth the upgrade.  Defective products happen.  I just hoped that their flagship headphones would have worked better.  Regardless, spending hundreds of dollars to replace something missing is an instant return anyway.<br/><br/>I hope this helped someone.  Sorry for too much text.</span>

<span>For starters, I’m not really going to review the sound quality, because in short they sound like a $300 pair of headphones. You can tweak the settings and make a custom EQ in the Bose Music app, so you can make it what you will. I listen to a lot of jazz, instrumental, metal, and I’m satisfied.<br/><br/>My main issues are with this current generation of ANC and the build quality on the Bose 700’s.<br/><br/>ANC: On one hand, it’s good. In certain environments I feel like I’m in a bubble and I can’t hear the world beyond. It’s perfect, just my music. In others, I can hear more than I would like. We’re talking, literally, I can listen to classical symphonic music on a lawn mower at a decent volume and hear the dynamics. It’s fantastic. There, I’m truly impressed. However at work, I sit at a desk and there’s machinery some 300 feet away. Drill press, a saw, and chiefly a large fan that’s always on for ventilation. It is loud, yes, but I also get the sense even on the highest setting, ANC isn’t fully engaged. I think this because I’ve ever had the 700’s on and sneezed, dropped something, or otherwise had a sudden loud noise nearby and I can feel what’s like a diaphragm move. Pressure changes in the cup, and momentarily that super loud sound is muted greater than the atmospheric noises. E.G. an alarm goes off at work and each individual tone going off results in a higher noise cancellation sensation. When I have ANC maxed out, I want it truly maxed out, not on an algorithm. You can already adjust what level you want ANC on, so I see no benefit to this feature. If I want to be deaf to the world, considering the original MSRP, I better be. If anything else it’s very jarring to hear the accompanying “popping” that occurs with the added acute noise cancellation.<br/><br/>Build quality: See picture…I’ve had these three months, have only worn them daily for two weeks as a test and the stainless steel frame has scratches from the ear cups. Also, every time I turn my head, a wonderful rubbing sound of the ear cup turning. In this department I am a bit of a snob. I typically don’t buy headphones that make a lot of frictional noise. As in I’ll literally jiggle display pairs of headphones to see if I can hear the plastic on plastic rubbing sound cheap pairs are plagued by. Anytime I’ve worn them outside I’ve wiped them off with a microfiber cloth and exclusively store them in the case. Aside from the vibrations from the aforementioned lawnmower, I have babied these due to the price. Hearing a plasticky popping sound whenever I turn my head, chew, adjust my glasses, is not something I expected from headphones marketed as having a stainless frame. This alone makes me wish I would have bought the Sony MK4’s.</span>

<span>These are great. I love the feel and the look. Real comfortable! Very sturdy. On the other hand… for a 100.00….no bag or case for storage? That’s a big goof.

<span>I'm no audiophile, gotta get that out of the way.<br/><br/>Three stars?  This is because of the cable, maybe nit-picky, but touching/movement of the cable resonates a very annoying sound into the headphones.  Also, if you grew up with a telephone with a coiled cable you will receive flashbacks about how awful they are.<br/><br/>So audio quality, these are definitely the best headphones I've ever used.  Plugging them into my Mac Book Pro with with DAC and dolby atmos turned on is absolutely amazing.  Must repeat, I am no audiophile or claim to have a heightened sense of hearing, also, my first "professional" set of headphones.  I do own Bose QC35, HyperX, Airpod Pros, all with their own function, but these Sennheiser's definitely have better sound and bass compared to my other headphones.<br/><br/>I will probably gift these to a friend and buy another pair with a replaceable straight cable, but with the fault I mentioned I still think they are amazing but would not buy this specific model with the same cable again.</span>

<span>I've owned a pair of these for nearly three years now and they still sound and work great. It was only just this week that the earpads began to fall apart, but I was able to get replacement ones for a little under $20.<br/><br/>I use these nearly every day for hours at a time. I run a music review blog where I'm constantly analyzing and comparing music and these have helped me get an accurate representation of the music. They're also great for mixing and producing, especially if you're on a budget. My only complaint is I wish the earpads and head cushion were slightly more plush as it can get a little uncomfortable after 2-3 hours of straight use. In all, these are extremely durable and they sound great. I would recommend these to anybody.</span>

<span>The Sennheiser HD 280 Pro "New Model" Assembled in the USA is a game-changer for me. Over the years I have tried several Senn Closed-Back headphones only to wonder how they could make some of the best Open Back Headphones and some of the worst Closed headphones. I'll back up a bit. My first pair of headphones was a pair of Koss Pro 4AA's. I had just gotten out of the Army and it was 1971. I loved them. I still have a pair of Koss Porta Pros to this day. My current headphone collection includes the Sennheiser HD 580 Jubilee, HD 650, and the New Model 280 HD Pro. I also have a pair each of the  Fostex T50RP MK3; the Sony MDR V900HD and the Sony MDR 7506, The original Audio Technica ATH M30 and the ATH M40fs, as well as a vintage pair of JVC HA-D990's that are not for sale.  None of these headphones are.<br/><br/>While none of the above info proves anything where my headphone expertise is concerned, it does prove I have good taste where headphones are concerned. So here's the thing. With the New Model HD280Pro Sennheiser has shown the World that it can make a very competitive Closed-Back headphone at a price almost anyone can afford. In addition to the New Model Senn 280 I also recently bought a pair of Audio Technica ATH M40x headphones. In my opinion, they are not even close to being as well built as my Old pair of Audio Technica ATH M30s. In direct comparison the Old M30s make the relatively New ATH M40X cans seem like a toy to me. Nor did they have near the sonic relationship with either my Solid State Emotiva A-100 BASX Amp or my Little Dot MK II tube amp. At about the same price the New M40x was not an improvement over my Old M40fs cans. In my opinion the M40x is a joke compared to my M40fs cans. About the same price, but not even close in every other respect. The M40x is a throwaway can, the M40fs is a keeper. The New Model Sennheiser HD280 Pro is a keeper as well. Very Neutral can. Lows, Mids, and Highs are ready to reveal what has been recorded.  If you don't like their sound it is probably your Sound Souce that is at fault. Some Bands are really not very good. Some Recording Engineers are not very good either. Some Bands and some Recording Engineers are great. The New Model HD280Pro will reveal which it is. Become an Audiophile. If Zen is selling water by a river, then being an audiophile is learning to know the difference between dogs barking and a host of singing angels Don't get me wrong. Sometimes barking at the moon is just what the good Doctor ordered. But nothing compares to the singing of angels. I think I will shut up for now and try out my New Model Sennheiser HD280s on two of my favorite angels. George Jones, and Patsy Cline. It doesn't get any better than that. Amen..</span>
