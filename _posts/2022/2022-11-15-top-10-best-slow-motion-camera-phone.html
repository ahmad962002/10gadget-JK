<span>I purchased this phone solely based on so many high reviews. For the life of me I can't figure out "why". Ok lots to like,  but let's all be honest, there is a glaring defect..  THE BATTERY!  Perhaps my new phone is a fluke I wouldn't know.  I can cook bacon and scramble eggs on it gets so hot.  The selling feature for me was the camera. It turns off often and forget about the video recorder as I get only 10 seconds tops and it shuts down with error message about being too hot. Simply way too powerful a phone for the small battery. Even recharging it is a chore. If plugged in while on,  it can run backwards as it takes the charge but more is consumed being on than the charge supplies. . Ironically, completely powered down it charges rather fast.  Sending back.  I had the Galaxy Alpha a much cheaper phone and totally problem free for so much less money. The downside of the Alpha is it has a smaller hard drive, I had a 32 gb and maxed it out... And isn't expandable to the best of my knowledge, so Xperia XZ can go out to 256 gb .... That is the awesome part!</span>

<span>I love this phone.  it's fast, elegant, and the right size for a pocket.  It's only been a week but I have been getting compliments on my phone  everyday since I took out of the box. Unfortunately the media and the providers would have you think that only Samsung and Iphones are the only premium phones on the market.  So, why 4 stars? Well,  the bloatware and more importantly the front facing speakers.  From a company like Sony, paltry speaker quality is disappointing,  but I bought the phone for its other functions, better speaker sound would have made 5 stars a no brainer.  Delivery was fast and the packaging was authentic.</span>

<span>Super short short summary: this phone is amazing. period. Get one ASAP.<br/><br/>I got this one after having been stuck two years with a carrier, with an Iphone 6, which there was supposed to be NO contract, etc., blah blah blah blah, and then all of a sudden after 24 mo it turns out it was a lease and I had to put down $200.00 to own it.  Well, not even six months had gone by and, despite taking care of the phone as much as I could, it was plagued with problems.  I took it to the carrier and said they could not find anything wrong with it, SHOCKING!, I know... these techies can never find anything wrong or they "fix" whatever is wrong only to appear again a couple of weeks afterwards.<br/><br/>However, I was tired of the poor execution, poor picture qualities under low light conditions, specially the front-facing camera. If I was doing a couple of tasks at the same time the phone would just, freeze, restart itself up or just plain go dark screen (which it scared the hell out of me a couple of times). Additionally, as I compared the new Iphone 7 with the XPERIA XZs it was just plain clear that, I was indeed, due for a change of phone brands, OS and companies.<br/><br/>My previous phone was CDMA and this one is GSM, which I had no problems whatsoever, transferring my old information, since the phone has a cool feature that lets you choose which old phone you had and with a usb-c to lightning connector it took little under two hours. Mind you I had the 128gb model, so wised up and got a 256gb micro SD. Best thing I did, now, with 320gb for the hard drive, and its Qualcomm Snapdragon 820 2x 2.2GHz, 2x 1.6GHz / Qualcomm Adreno 530 with 4gb of RAM I've had NO glitches NO issues with running more than one app, best of all I kept my Apple music thanks to Android N and continue to have access to all my previous music.<br/><br/>I honestly, feel this phone was a Godsend and the battery life can be further extended with a 'smart stamina mode' which can be customized in a myriad of ways: it can be set up so it is always this way, or kick in with a certain amount of your battery has been consumed. The usb-c makes transferring a lot of info a breeze and that 5.2" (1920x1080 full HD) feels like changing from boring normal def to real HD screen like a well deserved upgrade. In all honesty, if things keep up I'll start buying these XPERIA models very often, and when the XZ premium comes out with that ridic 4k screen you'll prob see me around with a new review.<br/><br/>Bottom line: You will NOT be disappointed. Just click 'ADD TO CART' and you will thank me later.</span>

<span>I have been using this phone for a few months now. I have the latest and greatest system software and apps from Sony. Here's what I think:<br/>-Battery life is adequate. Compared to my previous phone (a Sony Xperia Z5C), it lasts a lot less, but I can easily get through a busy day, so no complaints.<br/>-Sony always says some apps (notably camera) may shut down if the device heats up during use. It never happened with my previous Sony's (Z3C and Z5C), but it did happen once with XZs. Not too bad.<br/>-Sony deleted FM Radio app, and it can not be found/installed. While it's not that critical, it doesn't sit well with the idea that I upgraded from Z5C, which had it.<br/>-Similarly, this phone (although marketed as the flagship a short while ago) doesn't have Mirrorlink. A bummer for me because Z5C had it. XZs looks and works crippled in my car relying on just Android Auto.<br/>-The speed and general feeling is very similar to my previous Sony's, not particularly fast or anything. Contrary to what I saw in many other reviews, it takes a long time for camera to come up when you want to snap a quick photo. This may be because of location tagging that I enabled, but it is what it is and it leaves a lot to be desired in terms of camera start-up speed. Sometimes, the camera would come up but would not take photos. Not too often, but quite annoying when it happens.<br/>-Display quality and resolution is excellent, but adaptive brightness sometimes seems as though it was not enabled. Annoying at best.<br/>-Smartconnect (Sony's app to automatically do certain tasks when headphone or Bluetooth connections are made) is crippled on this phone for some reason. For example, with my Z5C, I was turning on the WiFi tethering as soon as my phone connected to car Bluetooth. This way, my car's unit was able to connect to the Internet through my Z5C's WiFi hotspot. Now, even though Smartconnect app can be installed on XZs, Sony removed the ability to turn on/off WiFi tethering for some odd reason. Very disappointing.<br/>-Super Slow Motion video capture is impractical, hard to use and pretty much is nothing more than a gimmick. It starts by shooting regular video, and you have press "slow motion" button at the right time. After that, it takes a few eeconds worth of video in super slow motion. If you can repeat the event that you are filming, you may get right it after a few trials, but for random events, it would be unlikely.<br/>-Audio quality is great with headphones. Speakers are clear too, but they are simply not loud enough. I can not hear quite many of Youtube videos even at the maximum volume if there is a slight background noise in the environment. In-call speaker volume is a little more than a joke.<br/>Overall, I thought I was upgrading but actually I now feel like I have downgraded my phone in many levels.<br/>I would not recommend this phone to anyone who wants to have a truly top of the line (or somewhere near there) phone.</span>

<span>(review written by iPhone user)<br/><br/>We bought this $200 Motorola Power phone to use as a land line after we discontinued cable service due to high cost. As such it seems to function adequately. The "power" moniker is supposed to represent long battery life. I think it has similar battery capacity as its siblings so I presume that lower power consuming chips are in use. It was only 10-20$ more. We successfully connected phone via bluetooth with our panasonic home portable phone setup. Around $60. The only thing different now is that the caller ID gives numbers instead of names. Likely related to change in carrier. We got a  cheap case with stand are satisfied.<br/><br/>Used mostly in stand-by mode the phone lasts for days without charging., Call quality is good. Screen is clear.<br/><br/>Missing are shake to wake, fingerprint recognition. You need to push the power button to wake.<br/><br/>The only glitch is by google.

<span>As others have noted, the fingerprint reader is not great. I upgraded from a 3a, and I really miss having a dedicated spot that I could press while my phone was still in my pocket, so that it was unlocked by the time I was looking at my phone. Now I have to get it out, find where I'm supposed to press, and sometimes try multiple times before it works. At best, it takes ~2 seconds longer to unlock than the 3a. I guess, in some ways, it's good to add a little friction to the process of unlocking my phone so maybe I'm less tempted to check it all the time?<br/><br/>One big improvement from the 3a is that my hotspot appears to work much, much better. I spend an hour or so a day on the bus, so I like to get as much work done as I can. My 3a worked fine in this regard from 2019 up through the pandemic, but since I started going back to work in fall 2021, the hotspot no longer worked for about a quarter of my bus ride, and it often dropped unexpectedly, meaning I would sometimes lose work. So far, I haven't had any hotspot issues with the 6a. That alone makes it worth upgrading.<br/><br/>As was expected, the performance feels much better. Apps and websites load a lot faster. I also like the wide angle lens.</span>

<span>I'm not what you'd call a power user, but this phone meets my needs very well. I've had no issues with the speed, display or memory on the phone. I don't believe the battery life is as long as they say. It usually lasts about five to six hours if I use it to stream video. One annoyance I have is the location of the speakers. When I hold my phone, my finger covers one of them, muting the phone and buzzing my finger. When I put a case on the phone, it helped somewhat with that though. Overall very pleased with it.</span>

<span>Original review: This phone is not really unlocked. The OEM Unlock option is greyed out in Developer Options!<br/><br/>Update!!! The phone I received came with Android 12 Apr2022 version, which will not let you enable the OEM Unlock option in Developer Options. However, once I went to System Updates and let it install Android 12 Jun2022 security update, factory reset the phone, connected to WiFi (all without a SIM inserted), I was able to enable the OEM Unlock option in Developer Options. I only gave it 4 out of 5 stars as I am sure many of us are trying to enable the OEM Unlock option and there are no instructions/messages from the supplier about the version issue. At least not one that I could find. I had to Google around to find a solution.</span>

<span>Disappointed no way to charge especially if this is your first Pixel device - good for Amazon had to order plug and/or an adapter.  Adapter that comes with it is the wrong sex to use with USB 3 electrical socket and supplied cable.  You would think Google wouldn’t want you to regret the purchase because you have no way to charge even before setup.  Google claims everyone should have had a plug like this already.  I know many especially Android/iPhone/iPad users that are still on lightning or older android type cables.  Phone seems to be ok haven’t used much.  Much heavier than Pixel 4a.  Think it will take some getting use to.</span>

<span>Overall the S22+ is a great phone and great upgrade if you're considering it.  LTE/5G weak signal performance is greatly improved over previous S series phones.  The display is significantly brighter and easier to read in the sun as well.<br/><br/>Before I continue my review, please note I am reviewing a phone purchased from Amazon directly and fulfilled by Amazon.  Be careful when buying from other sellers on Amazon, make sure to check your phone's model is SM-G906U1 and not an international model.<br/><br/>I upgraded from an S10+ and here are some of the pros and cons I've noticed after owning this phone for a bit:<br/><br/>Pros:<br/><br/>#1 significant improvement, weak signal LTE and 5G performance!  This phone consistently gets a stronger signal than my S10+ and also has some reception where other phones have none.<br/><br/>LTE/5G speeds seem to be improved too.  It will regularly maintain speeds of 100mbps (usually more) on ATT.<br/><br/>Bluetooth performance is improved too, it can go a few feet more before it disconnects from my Galaxy Watch.<br/><br/>Phone call audio is crystal clear and easily understandable.  Best I've ever heard, even using VoLTE.<br/><br/>Very bright and easily readable screen.  In addition, the 120hz variable refresh rate is way better than the standard 60hz on my S10+. You have to see it to believe it!<br/><br/>Phone is very fast (especially with the latest software update from March).  I can open multiple tabs in chrome and the phone doesn't slow down one but.  In addition, I have noticed my DJI drone app doesn't freeze up or lag anymore on this phone.<br/><br/>I'm not sure what the other reviewers are talking about when they say the Snapdragon 8 Gen 1 is worse than the 888.  In my testing, the 8 Gen 1 in the S22+ consistently benchmarks higher than the 888 scores.<br/><br/>Powerful graphics, most 3D mobile games easily run at 60 FPS on this phone.  Compared to the S10+, this is a huge upgrade, as it could barely maintain 30 FPS.<br/><br/>Camera picture quality is crystal clear in the day and excellent even at night.  I'm no pro photographer, but the night/low light pictures are outstanding.  The 8k video looks super clear even when viewed on my 4k computer monitor.<br/><br/>Battery life is good.  Easily lasts a full day and even more if you force the phone to LTE only (use code *#*#4636#*#* in the dialer).  The key to long battery life is to reduce the amount of apps running in the background as much as possible.  If you load your phone up with junk, battery life will be reduced considerably.<br/><br/>Cons:<br/><br/>The speaker can be damaged if you crank it up to full volume.  Samsung should release a software patch limiting the volume of it.  For now, don't use it at full volume, or it will start to crackle, as described in other reviews.<br/><br/>No microSD card slot, so get the 256GB version if you like to take a lot of 4k video.  The 128GB version fills up fast when videoing.<br/><br/>No headphone jack, this is a huge disappointment, I can't use my Heil headphones with my phone anymore.<br/><br/>I don't use the fingerprint reader or face recognition, so I can't provide any info on those.</span>

<span>All of the features work well- fingerprint rwader, facial recognition, wireless charging, good battery life- all gets good marks. But, the factory apps are at best average. Without a better launcher and enterprise level email, calendar, contacts and such, it's not an enterprise level device. But, if you refuse to be assimilated into the iWorld, like me, and from my own personal experience, I would take this over iStuff all day long.</span>

<span> I tend to not get new phones my last one was an S7 lol so I was very excited to play with this.<br/><br/>I was extremely impressed with the photo quality in day and night "I'll put some night pictures up later" I posted the day pictures and get lots of comments on how good I am lol it not me though because if I used my S7 they would look like crap. Opening multiple apps is another plus I can play my Pokémon Go and other stuff without a problem. I use it for my drivers camera to capture accidents and such on the way home and wherever I'm driving. I find it better than a dash cam because I know how to navigate my phone better than those little dash cams. I just wish it had more space because I like to store a ton of stuff on my phone and now they don't have SD cards.<br/>Battery life is good I have no complaints. I can play with it all day at work "8 hours " at my job and not worry and the speed is awesome! I'm happy with my purchase. I'll see what I can do about  space later.</span>

<span>First off I had the s21 I recently purchased but felt that the screen was way too small so I ended up getting the plus version for the s22 instead of the standard one as that is about the same size. This sized phone will work well if you have medium - semi larger hands. Though I wish it was slightly bigger it was well worth spending the extra cash for the plus version. I still wish the finger print reader was on the Power button of the phone like how the Motorola 2021 edge version had. The camera is nicer then the 2021 edge and the s21  I had also prior to switching to Samsung crisp clear pictures with no blurryness. So far the phone runs super fast and does not get hot like the s21.  Now for the missing aux cable sure it is disappointing and wished samsung would of included a USB-C to aux adapter , something I already own but costed a good 20 bucks. So to people complaining about no aux port just get that adapter it's super small and works well with any aux port u plug into works just like a regular aux with no notice of degraded audio quality. This phone also has less glare and is more brighter than the s21. Far more brighter. The refresh rate is nice and so is the processor. Didn't have the phone slow down at all get. Battery life is nice but it still does not Last long as the Motorola flag ship has or charges fast enough. It is kinda sad to see samsung also not include a wall charger to plug the charger into your phone only a USB c cable rofl. The glass on this phone is sturdy when dropping on wood however I wouldn't suggest you accidently drop it on a hard cement surface or marble cabinet. Samsung brags that they have good gorilla glass but they don't the s22 ultra I heard shattered from dropping short fall. Make sure you get a case when using phone  on hard surfaces. Phone is nice I would get this over the regular s22 I suggest to anyone reading this as that phone is just way to small. (Edited to 2 stars after 28 days of owning it it developed dead pixils and small microscratches from just using my fingers never dropped the phone once my thought is that I got a defective phone so returned it</span>

<span>Cameras are nothing to write home about but are serviceable in good lighting. I picked this up as my primary phone after I gave my OnePlus 9 Pro to my GF after she destroyed her phone.<br/><br/>Top reasons for my pick on this one:<br/>3.5mm headphone jack<br/>MicroSD card support (I have a 1TB in mine currently, loaded with music, ROMs, and a few movies when traveling)<br/>The underrated Snapdragon 480 (PS2 emulation is possible, lighter titles only)<br/>The size and feel in hand is superb in comparison to others in this weight class.<br/><br/>Top criticisms I have:<br/>Cameras are lacking in finer details, noisy in lowlight<br/>Plastic back will pick up scratches easily - a case is highly recommended<br/>The fingerprint reader is temperamental at times<br/><br/>Overall, this is a solid and affordable option for those not wanting to plop down $1k or more for a phone that will easily do 95% what a flagship can. The Nord N200 5G will have 95% of the performance of flagships in your daily use (social media, web browsing, listening to music/watching movies). Surprising to me, shortly after setup and installing some emulators, this thing will run PS2 and GameCube games rather well (and beyond my expectations in most cases), anything older, aside from Sega Saturn is flawless. Not the gaming phone I had expected, but it definitely was a welcome bonus to the land of phones lacking 3.5mm audio and microSD support (seriously, Sony is the only flagship maker still putting this out). Pick up a good controller (such as a Razer Kishi, or an 8bitdo) and get some classic gaming in while on a plane or subway.<br/><br/>This is a solid recommend if you don't require flagship specs and flagship pricing.</span>

<span>This is the best 5G phone for subpar -$500 or less budget market. The interface offers fast, buttery operations with above average somewhere north of 60 GHz exchange rate from the middling cpu, 6.4" screen and massive battery that easily lasted a day and a half of moderate use with very good multitask (apps) performance from supposedly top-notched hardwares, at least  on paper. The latest Nord iteration also ups the ante on aesthetic with a sleek, smooth composite profile especially the back cover, giving it a premium feel. 5G experience on T-MOBILE was noticably better than LTE though not a fast pronounced as than the one on Verizon. The camera takes great photos outdoors and marginal indoor shoots with poor mode or those with little light. Finally, the price is right at around $250 (I nabbed it for $199 during a short promo), making it not just the cheapest 5G set but best budget phone of the year hands down over comparable rivals that I've owned or used like Moto G power and Samsung budget A-series.</span>

<span>I purchased this phone to use as my second device. Honestly, for the money it has not disappointed me. When purchasing phones at this price point, there is always a little give and take when it comes to performance and features. However, I do think OnePlus has struck a nice balance with this model.<br/>When I unboxed it the first thing that struck me was the build quality. This absolutely maintains the form factor of their more expensive devices. My primary phone is a OnePlus 8T and this is definitely reminiscent of that.<br/>As far as the features and performance is concerned, everything works as it is supposed to. I am actually very impressed by the side mounted fingerprint sensor which doubles as the power button. It works quickly and efficiently and I really feel that even they're more expensive devices should have this feature. In addition, the screen resolution and viewing angles are very sharp and the phones battery power is amazing. I am also very impressed with the single firing speaker at the bottom of the device. A lot of companies tend to cheap out on their speakers when it comes to their more affordable devices. Fortunately, the sound is crisp and clear and definitely not tinny.<br/>Connectivity has definitely not been a problem since I purchased the phone. I am not only getting 4G LTE connections but, 5G is connecting exactly how it should. Although, when it comes to factory unlocked OnePlus devices 5G is only capable on the T-Mobile network and it's other carriers such as Metro by t-mobile, mint mobile and many others. Thus, don't expect to get 5G on networks like AT&amp;t, Verizon and their subsidiaries because, it will not happen.<br/>Oneplus decided to equip this phone with the Qualcomm Snapdragon 480 5G processor which is rated at 2.0 GHz per second. They also equipped the phone with 4 GB of RAM. The best way to describe the processing performance is steady and reliable. It is not the fastest processor in the world but, it will get the job done. After all, this is a $240 phone and not one of their $1,000 models. Frankly, you cannot expect flagship performance like you would get with the Snapdragon 865 chipset or the Snapdragon 888. Again, it is not the fastest processor in the world but, it is not the slowest by far. You will have absolutely no problems performing day-to-day tasks, streaming movies and even gaming to a degree. Moreover, the 90 Hertz screen refresh rate definitely compensates for a lot of this.<br/>Understand, I am reading this device for what it is and not based on what it's not. If you are looking for a reliable good looking smartphone and you don't want to pay a lot of money then this is really the device you want. I have used it for about a month now and I am very happy with it. I would definitely not hesitate to recommend it.</span>

<span>I've lost count of the mobile phones I've owned over the past 20 years and this model is clearly the best in every way. The price/performance ratio is unbeatable. The only weakness of this phone is the ability to use a finger print to unlock, but since the face unlock works so well the finger print issue is irrelevant for me.  Taking pictures and videos are intuitive and pretty much fool proof. Navigation is simple and easy. Speakerphone is excellent.</span>

<span>The product arrived a day after through Amazon Prime in a amazon renewed box. Packaging was pretty much on par with factory packaging, and included the s10e, generic charging brick and cable along with sim card tray tool.<br/>PHONE'S PHYSICAL CONDITION: The s10e was pretty much in "like new" shape cosmetically aside from a bit of residue around the cameras that easily wiped off. Also has very little amount of grim in the corner of the upper speaker that I don't care to clean out. ALSO had very small damage on the lower left corner of the unit on the bezel and very little on the screen. I had to inspect to find it. Nonetheless with a case and screen protector the phone is like a brand new phone cosmetically.<br/><br/>SOFTWARE: Android 12 with One UI 4 on the s10e is snappy and ready to work! (comes updated). I'm a serious multitasker and so far I haven't had much complaints at all. Camera is great. Only gripe with this is that typing properly is a bit of a task ( I am coming from an A51 with a much larger and slightly wider screen).<br/><br/>I specifically chose the s10e not only for its size but also for the fingerprint sensor on the power button. It's pretty much instant.<br/>BATTERY LIFE is naturally horrible. Small phone = small battery. Especially when paired with the same processing power as its bigger brothers. Will not last an entire day with a power user or even with a kid on youtube.</span>

<span>See pics! Last 3 are from the phone’s camera. Nothing spectacular, but it can take great photos even in low light to say the least!<br/><br/>About the phone: Battery life is one of its greatest features. Easily lasting 2 days of regular usage. 3 days if it’s less than regular. All this with the brightness cranked to the max or near max cause it gets bright! You get a headphone jack and strong audio quality so listening to music on this phone is absolutely lovely and without audio loss.<br/><br/>I love the 120 hrz. It’s a beautiful sight that makes it hard to go back from there. Note that it’s not set initially and must be turned on in “display settings”. Speaking of display, at 1080 X 2520 OLED res with its slimmer form factor, it’s amazingly clear. The HDR blows my other OS phone out of the water. Especially when watching videos.<br/><br/>You get a dual sim which I’ve utilized by adding an extra SD card. Any phone that allows for SD card expansion gets a Huge plus and kudos in my book.<br/><br/>The processor is powerful at 8gb ram. It’s not max power at 12, but please keep in mind that this phone’s main selling point is its CAMERA.<br/><br/>That being said, it’s quite a beast at gaming anyway:<br/>I’ve played genshin at max settings (as it’s a demanding title) and other aaa mobile games without any problems. (Except for a certain popular fort battle royale nite game. That is pretty choppy here)<br/>Emulators up to ps2 run beautifully on this phone as well. I do play those a lot and am fully satisfied with its performance there. You do need to make some tweaks to get full speeds on emulators though, but that’s not really the phone’s fault.<br/><br/>About the camera: You get a fully fledged camera here. I’m honestly overwhelmed with the features you get but that’s what I was looking forward to most and have not been disappointed. This IS one of the best phone cameras you can get these days and that’s where the price ultimately lies.<br/><br/>The things I don’t like: This phone gets HOT fast. It even warns you of hand burning whenever you turn on the default camera app. I have my phone in a case now and no longer feel the heat of it, but it DOES stutter the performance should you do anything demanding for a little while.<br/>That’s not great at all as it hurts the performance of the phone, cutting its power in basically half should you use it seriously…<br/>Hopefully, some kind of patch mends this more in the future.<br/><br/>This issue right here is why I cannot give it 5 stars. The phone is powerful in specs, but you can’t always utilize those specs due to the constant overheating. I live in CA and it’s still hot out here which makes that even more apparent. I can’t imagine next summer..<br/><br/>Overall, it’s a powerful, slim form factored phone with a lot more features than just its Powerful camera. It’s has one strong setback that’s holding its full power back as of right now. I hope it will be fixed in the future, but this will still be my go to phone for the foreseeable future. 4. Stars from me.</span>

<span>Sony Xperia 5 IV is a truly remarkable phone. The size feels "just right", the responsiveness is on point, and overall the phone truly delivers what you pay for. I've tried out Galaxy and some other Android phones, but when I'm spending this kind of money - I really only trust Sony to have my back.<br/>I haven't had to repair any of my previously owned products (Xperia 1 III - IV, 5 III) etc but I have reached out a few times via their Sony Chat Support and it's nice knowing they have many options to accommodate.<br/>Give this phone a try - you won't regret it.</span>

<span>If you rely on WiFi calling find another phone! Seems pretty ridiculous Sony wouldn't make sure their phone is supported on one of the only carriers that you can use with it.</span>

<span>The Sony Xperia 5 IV is a wonderful device in this day of massive slabs of glass.<br/><br/>It has a wonderful 6.1" 21:9 screen that reproduces colors beautifully and allows for amazing media consumption! It was such a treat to watch a movie trailer and rotate the phone and have the video absolutely fill every last inch of the screen. The settings for the colors and refresh rate are a bit simplified for my tastes, forcing either 120hz or 60hz and HDR on or off. It's a bit selective on whether it allows 120hz with HDR at the same time and warns of heat generation possibly turning these advanced features off if the phone gets too hot. Having the screen be 21:9 allows for my thumb to reach completely across the device without repositioning while holding it one handed and it feels so much better having that large vertical orientation to scroll through lots of information. I definitely prefer this aspect ratio compared to others that are more popular these days.<br/><br/>The speakers.... are a bit lacking... Compared to other devices on the market, they're definitely a bit more hollow and definitely pump out less volume than my other phone and others that friends and family have. One MASSIVE thing that this phone has going for it over the vast majority of other devices on the market currently is a 3.5mm headphone jack (which also functions as a mic in if that's your thing)!!!! This is HUGE for those of us who still prefer real connectivity vs any wireless standard.<br/><br/>The connectivity is great and passes through good audio and gave me good signal throughout the day as I went to and from work and on errands. The battery life was also stellar and got me through an entire day without having to baby it or put it on the charger midday at all.<br/><br/>The cameras on the 5 IV are phenomenal and snapped some great pictures. The color reproduction was definitely different than my other phone, but I feel like they were more true to life. The camera itself offered a TON of options for both stills and video. This phone is definitely one for content creators who need a powerful camera and phone to edit pictures, video, and audio on the fly. I didn't poke around too much into the content creator apps, but they seem incredibly powerful and useful. The camera app itself also warns about possible overheating while it's being used, which gives me cause for concern if you were using it constantly for editing and video taking. Heat dissipation definitely seems to be an issue for this device considering how many warnings there are about it.<br/><br/>This device is gorgeous and well constructed and worth a look if you're into content creation or just looking for a new phone that will get a lot of jobs done very well. 9/10 in my book for Sony.</span>

<span>Beautiful phone, with excellent features, Incredible Price, and unbelievable customer support!<br/>Problem #1: It DOES NOT come with the screen protector and TPU case as promised. Though they will send you one each free after you receive the phone, with all the info you will need that is located on a sticker on the box it comes in,and register on their web site. But now you have a brand new phone, but nothing to protect it for up to 10 business days!<br/>Problem #2: It DOES come with an almost worthless quick-start guide. After spending just short of an hour between to members of the support team. ( It really is amazing!. Dial the number, It rings twice and a live Human answers and ask how they can help!, No getting jerked around pushing 6-7 different buttons to reach a Human! ). I find out that they have no way to Email a user manual because one DOES NOT exist. there is no such animal. The best they could do is send me a link to a PDF of their completely different  X6 Phone which is totally worthless with the B15. It was like buying a new Ford Mustang. And being given a owners manual to a Subaru Forester! It WASN'T the support team's fault. They just didn't have the resources, Because the resources don't exist, even through corporate! If you are 6 or 7 years old. And have the ability to figure out all tech savvy stuff on the planet, like all other 6-7 year olds can do. You most likely don't need a manual. But me being a 65 year old man I DO! Hell. The B15 phone has 5 cameras, The phone I have now has only 2, of which I barely can work one! Let alone facial recognition,  finger print scanners, and A Startrek like transporter!</span>

<span>Great unlocked phone for the price, the fingerprint sensor is a slight wonky but reads about 85 percent of the time. Stand by time for battery is pretty good, but drains faster using it like most phones, but just a bit more than normal, but for the price I would HIGHLY recommended this UNLOCKED phone !!!!</span>
