<span>Have had this installed by myself easily for about 2+ months now.  It is SO VERY NICE that it does not use wifi and records directly to the usb drive, besides having an easy to use viewing system. This is exactly what I wanted it to do.  The documentation could be better and the little mouse-like button is difficult to press in the direction you want.  I just have to remember when the electricity is removed from the monitor, you have to press the power button again to get it back on as it does not automatically power on.  Also, I do not know yet how it will do with the snow -- the rain has not yet been a problem because it is slightly protected by the eaves but sometimes we get horizontal rain so it may not survive.</span>

<span>**** EDITED 2/9/17 *****<br/>I'm putting my edit first in my review so anyone reading this might see it a little easier. I've had this system a little over 3 months and the system is still very glitchy as described in the following review. Along with the other problems I had, now one of my cameras has lost its 2-way communication ability. The audio is still available coming to the receiver, but when the button is pushed to communicate for someone in the cameras view, there is no audible sound whatsoever. Not that I'd ever use it, but it would be nice for the cameras features to last more than 3 months. I'm not too confident in the system's longevity at this point. I'll post more updates as needed...<br/>-----------------------------------------------------<br/><br/>Let me start out by saying I REALLY wanted to like this system. I know it's not a high dollar, crystal clear, flawless system and I was willing to overlook this just so I could have something in place at my house to help defend against the crackhead thievery that's been plaguing my neighborhood for the last several months. There is generally someone always home, so I wasn't going to have to rely solely on the system to help protect my property. In short, it was basically going to be used as a secondary form of defense. The combination audio, video, and motion detection was great, but when you throw in the recording capabilities this system offered, I figured it would be a great weapon in my arsenal to spite the known video quality (or lack thereof). I'm not so sure now. I've had this system for 8 days and my issues started on day 1...<br/><br/>SETUP: The cameras arrived paired with the monitor from the factory, so it was literally plug and play. The cameras were easy to mount and had more than enough power cord for my application. The adjustments for the cameras and recording were accessed from the 7" display monitor and were extremely easy to figure out without even looking at the directions and would have been, even for someone that may not be very tech savvy.  In my opinion, setup (minus camera mounting) was so easy a child could do it.<br/><br/>DISTANCE: My cameras are mounted in areas no greater than 30' from the receiver and I haven't had a minutes issue with reception, regardless of the fact the camera signal is traveling through brick exterior walls as well as interior walls. No issues there.<br/><br/>VIDEO: The video resolution is 640x480. I knew this, not an issue. During daylight hours, it's actually crisp enough to make out faces of people caught in the recordings, but license plates at a distance of more than 20' aren't 100% legible depending on angle. The make/model of vehicles can be easily figured out though. During night vision mode, it isn't quite the case, which I expected. The resolution during infrared illumination is quite fuzzy and there isn't a chance of making out faces, license plates, or make and model of vehicles at ANY distance. Basically, if you have a night time prowler, all the video from this dystem is going to do is let you verify somebody took your stuff. At close proximity to the cameras it's worse. Any subjects in view are completely washed out by the infrared illumination to the point they're nothing but a white blob on the screen. I wasn't really expecting this, but it's still not an issue due to the fact this was a secondary means of security for me. Still not a deal breaker, BUT...<br/><br/>MOTION DETECTION: THIS herein is where I start having issues with this system. It's completely unreliable, which makes this system all but useless unless you want to sit in front  of a 7" screen to monitor your property the rest of your life. Whether the motion detection is going to pick up movement is completely hit and miss on the cameras I received. I don't know if it's a common problem or if I have a defective system, but either way, it's unacceptable. During setup, you have a recording option which allows you to set the record time for detections. For example, you have the option of 15, 30, and 60 second record times once motion is detected. I have mine set on 60 seconds. Of course as long as the camera senses movement the recording continues, which is a great feature, but it seems sensing movement is the issue with mine. Recording times are an issue as well, I might add. I'll check the recordings saved to the SD card at the end of the day and find some of my known daily activities are completely missing, some have been recorded for only 7 seconds, and some were recorded for 10 minutes AFTER all movement has left the proximity (i.e. when I go back into the house). I have adjusted detection sensitivity so many times I could literally navigate to that menu with my eyes closed, so I know for a fact it's properly set. I'm not sure what the malfunction is, but it's not something I'm willing to overlook as the cost of settling for substandard performance from a security system is just too great. I'll give them a few more days,but if it doesn't improve, this system is going back to Amazon for a refund. Looking long term, I just can't take the chance with malfunctioning cameras.<br/><br/>I'm giving this system 2 stars only because everything other than motion detection and infrared recording is completely acceptable. The motion detection issues are the deal breaker for me. Hope my review helps in your decision.<br/><br/>Troy/47/TX</span>

<span>Sorry to the seller.  The product is great.  Worked great for years.  My issues is with Amazon.  I thought my system had failed so I ordered another.  I fixed it and cancelled my order within minutes but Amazon didn't cancel the order and now it has shipped and I'll have to return it.  This cost the seller or Amazon not me, which is the only good thing I can say, but it's a waist of money for somebody and that isn't good in the grand scheme of free markets.<br/>It's not like me to grouse about a thing and not do something to make it better.  I can't do anything about the order process but I can share how I fixed my problem.  The symptom was that when I woke up and looked at the monitor it was black.  I checked the power and plugged it back in and the opening screen came on flashing but it wouldn't fully boot up so I couldn't get to the menu to try to trouble shoot.  I looked all over for a reset button and tried everything including pairing the cameras even I couldn't get to that setting through the menu.  Finally I sat down and ordered another Defender system because it has work flawlessly for over 5 years.  I got up to look at the thing one more time and noticed the memory card.  I pulled it out and BOOM!  It started booting up, I literally dropped everything and dashed to the computer to cancel my new order within minutes.  Bottom line is the Defender is a great dependable system.  I have a $800 fancy 8 camera system with a DVR and all the bells but the system I set before I go out is the  Defender.  I've never had to reset the cameras or re-pair them like my expensive system.  True the image isn't quite as crisp and the monitor is small but the cameras have a speaker that works well so you can hear what people are saying at the gate 300 feet away.  If I could only have one system I would get the 4 camera Defender.</span>

<blockquote><em><div class="a-row a-spacing-small review-data"><span class="a-size-base review-text review-text-content" data-hook="review-body">
<span>There's a lot to like about these little cameras, so I'll start with the pros first before moving on to a few (mostly negligible) cons.<br/><br/>Pros:<br/>Image quality is very good. 1080p is crystal clear and the ability to zoom, even on event recordings, is a great feature to have. The Starlight feature is also great. I have one camera mounted on an upstairs window facing out and the image quality even in the middle of the night is great. Unless it's very dark, I'd leave the Starlight feature on instead of the standard IR night vision.<br/><br/>Connectivity has been stable and reliable. I check my cameras often when I'm away from home and I've yet to experience any connection issues. I've only had it for a couple of months, so I can't speak on the longevity, but I have dealt with Wyze customer support on some issues I had with their home security hub and the customer service has been very good. Good enough that I plan to keep them as my primary home security system.<br/><br/>You can mount them practically anywhere. They come with several different mounting options, ranging from a standard flat base built into the camera, to 3M mounting strips, an even drywall anchors. The supplied power cord is a reasonable length for most applications, but you'll want to look into a longer USB-to-Micro USB cord if you plan on mounting more than 6-7 feet from a power outlet. They say they're rated for outdoor use, which is a nice touch. I only use mine inside, though I did buy their window mount that allows one of my cameras to face outside and not be subjected to the elements.<br/><br/>They do a decent job detecting people, vehicles, and even animals! Even the cam I have facing the street picks up on moving vehicles, people walking their dogs, etc., from several hundred feet away.<br/><br/>Rules and detection zones, detection sensitivity, and many more options are available, though some require a subscription.<br/><br/>Cons:<br/>Some people might be turned off by the subscription required to view certain events. You *can* install a Micro SD card and get limited event viewing options, though the Cam Plus subscription is also a good deal and gives you a lot of extras like person detection, cloud storage, and the ability to view longer event clips along with other features. The subscription is worth it if you're looking for a home security solution. If you're just looking for a camera to keep an eye on your pets while you're away, then you can probably get by without a subscription. They give you a 2-week trial of the Cam Plus so you can see what it's capable of. If you don't need it, then just install your SD card and go about your day.<br/><br/>The camera does a decent job recording audio but the speaker on it is puny, so talking to someone through it sounds like you're yelling into a tin can from the camera's end. The communication feed may be better on their products like the doorbell cam, but I don't have one of those to test out.<br/><br/>Those minor cons aside, these cameras have worked flawlessly for me since I've had them. I honestly didn't expect so much from such inexpensive cameras. Like I mentioned earlier, I have had to deal with their customer service on another Wyze product (not any of their cameras I own) and they have been great at helping troubleshoot issues and didn't hesitate to send a replacement product when the troubleshooting didn't work. It's great that they stand behind their products.</span>

<span>I installed several v3's  7 months ago. They worked well. However, Wyze was constantly requiring me to install endless updates. It seemed like every week or two. Well, the last update bricked all of my camera's.<br/><br/>Power cycling did nothing. So I took a couple of the camera's down and reset them. All of them went back on line without a problem. However, as soon as I unplugged them to reinstall them, guess what! Dead again. I reset them again--three times same result. Each time they were power cycled they went into the install mode and wouldn't come out of it so they could reconnect.<br/><br/>I called Wyze tech support and they made me repeat all the steps I had already done multiple times. Why? Because the support person doesn't know much about the cameras. They're simply reading from a help desk script, and they have to check off the boxes, or they get in trouble.<br/><br/>They tried to convince me it was my fault. The network router wasn't good enough. Too many things were connected to it. On and on. I'm an engineer so I know BS when I hear it. All the cameras worked fine including the previous updates until this last one. Then bricked. That's not a coincidence, and they know it. They've had the brick problem happen numerous times, so tech support has heard it all before. Any little info packet problem, minor power spiking, wifi signal wavering or any other type of interference can cause the flash update to go wrong. All of these things are normal and should be expected with any wifi connected equipment.<br/><br/>Wyze finally agreed to replace all of the cameras, but it took about three hours going in circles with them. I've already spent close to six hours taking cameras down, testing them, talking to tech support twice, and now I've got to reinstall all the cameras again. These are good, inexpensive cameras--when they work. Tech support is available, but watch out because every problem is caused by something on your end. They really love to blame the router.<br/><br/>Bottom line--they just don't want to replace the cameras if they can convince you everything is your fault. This time they did replace them, which I appreciate. They asked me to return the failed cameras, which I don't mind, but it's just more of my time. Of course, their engineers want to look at them. Really! They'll be sitting in a box somewhere with the other few thousand failures. They'll get to mine around 2026 when someone throws them in the trash bin. They want the cameras back to insure I'm not trying to get over on them, and get free cameras.<br/><br/>When the time I've spent is taken into consideration, these cameras aren't very cost effective. My time isn't free, even though Wyze acts like it is. We'll see how long the new ones last. If their "technical team" keeps updating every few weeks like they're doing now, they'll brick some more cameras. It's the risk of e-prom updates. I would skip the updates, but they pop up a nag screen every time I open a camera. It's annoying. Clicking "don't show again" is just another waste of time. Customers aren't sitting around waiting for every minor change in the software. One or two updates a year would be adequate. Let me decide if I want the updates. Oh, that won't work because some of the updates are about taking away stuff like the 12 second videos that originally came with the cameras. What a crock!<br/><br/>It takes at least an hour to set up a half dozen cameras. Each camera has to be updated from 1 to 4 times during the setup process, depending on when it was manufactured. That takes a lot of time. Then it will take me another hour plus to reinstall them. In total, this brick update will cost me 9 to 10 hours of my time, at least.<br/><br/>Wyze has better tech support than most security camera companies. It's just slow having to go through the help screen over and over no matter how many times something has already been done.  One tech support person was willing to sit on hold while I uninstalled one camera from the roof. Ok, let me whip out the ladder, climb on the roof and do that for you. I guess they wanted their lunch break.<br/><br/> At least they replaced the cameras, THEY ruined.<br/><br/>I took one of the old bricked cameras that I didn't have to send back, and I re-flashed it with a clean update. That failed also, so whatever happened during the update is permanent. That's another design flaw. There's no way to reverse an update and fix a problem. That's also a problem that should be addressed.<br/><br/>Tech Support  3 or 4 stars--depending on who happens to answer the phone.<br/>Cam V3  (when it works)  4 stars<br/>Constant Updates  1 star<br/>Camera Software  3 stars<br/>Wasting my time  1 star<br/>Wifi issues 2 stars<br/><br/>I'll use them without EVER updating them again--at least until they force an update which they do from time to time. Maybe they have a hardware problem that needs fixing! When lots of people are reporting their cameras have bricked after updates, or after a power recycle, it's not a random glitch.  When I was buying the camera's, Wyze didn't mention anywhere in their advertisements or product descriptions that I needed to have them within 10 feet of my router, or whatever they think the maximum distance should be, for them to update properly. They didn't say I had to have less than X devices connected to my wifi. Smart home devices (especially switches) show as connected even though they don't degrade the wifi signal strength except for the split second when one is activated, and the loss of signal strength is marginal.<br/><br/>The problem with their wifi strength argument is if my cameras are in a location where  they have a constant, stable wifi connection 24/7 with no problems recording video to the micro SD card, then that should be adequate wifi connectivity for an update. The previous  10 updates completed with no problems. Again, they should be asking a lot of questions about why some updates and a few random power cycling events are bricking v3 cameras. There's a solution to this problem, if they want to find it.</span>

<span>Ordered one from Amazon, $35. Like that camera can sit inside on window sill, flush to the glass of the window, and perfect video picture, night vision is spectacular (have read some ambient light outside is required). No need to worry about batteries or wiring, it plugs into the wall. You also do not need a subscription for just basic usage, but it will only film an event and notify you once every 5 minutes if you opt for no subscription. For $15/year, it is unlimited with no 5 minute pause between even detections. Has a micro SD slot (micro SD card not included), we just used one we had, but not necessary for camera operation. It can also be paired with other appliances through an IFTT app like a garage door.<br/>The MAJOR ISSUE is that even though you may set your detection area, the detection is via a change in pixels (where Ring, Blink, etc. are infrared and detect a heat source) and we receive an EXCESSIVE DETECTION NOTIFICATIONS when the sun sets and shines through the leaves or at night when car headlights flash across the detection area. We have also read where people receive excessive detection notifications when it rains or bugs attracted to light, but we have not had an opportunity to put it to the test with these. The only solution to minimize these notifications for these non-events is to move the camera or to set up rules to silence events during certain times of the day. For the cost, we decided we can live with this. Our walk around for now, is to just have one family member's phone receive alerts. And the other family members must block the alerts for this specific app in the settings of their phone (not within the app, or it blocks everyone's notifications).<br/>Only the initial person who sets up the camera on the app, can make a lot of the changes to the camera within the app. And other family members are just shared access to the camera and can set up their own rules. The initial person who did the set up will receive notifications a split second before the people it is shared with.<br/>Ordered a 2nd one that was supposed to be new, but WAS OPENED and still had the UPS stickers on it with the customer's name and address who had returned it. So returning the 2nd camera and ordering a replacement, hopefully this one will be new.<br/>Realize with any electronics that receive updates (like with cell phones, fitness trackers, etc), they do not have an infinite life due to technology restrictions so another reason to go for this budget friendly option. I believe Wyze retired support for their 1st model after 5 years.<br/>Price on Wyze website was $29.99 ($57.98 for 2) plus $5.99 shipping, but decided buying it from amazon would make sure we had free returns with Prime. Wyze is a company started by former Amazon employees and it is based in Seattle.<br/>Update: very sensitive to raindrops on the window, birds, neighbors' lights turning on and creates an event and notification.</span>

<span>I started out very excited to use Wyze's camera and service, and now, sadly, I struggle to recommend it. I signed up for a 14-day trial, and Wyze did not meet the high hopes and expectations I had for them.<br/><br/>There are at least four components crucial to the Wyze experience, and this is how I rate them:<br/>Wyze App: 3 out of 10 <br/>Wyze Customer Service: 2 out of 10<br/>Wyze v3 Cam/Products: 8 out of 10<br/>Noonlight Home Monitoring Service: 10 out of 10<br/><br/>Here's how my experience of the Wyze app and brand has been as a new, once-eager, now-reticent customer:<br/><br/>1. Due to a glitch with the Wyze app, my home monitoring service was not active for the first 8 days of my 14-day trial.<br/>2. Due to another glitch with the Wyze app, I was unable to deactivate my "Armed" status in the app, and was forced to leave my camera off in order to walk around my own home, resulting in another half-day of inactive service.3. Due to yet another glitch in the app, even though I disarmed my system before entering my home, it did not actually disarm in the app, and went off yet again, upon me entering my own home.<br/>4. Before the end of my trial, Wyze sent me a misleading email containing the words (all quotes here): "Extend your Cam Plus Pro Free Trial" and "Your Cam Plus Pro free trial is ending soon, but we want to make sure you have enough time to understand why it's so great. So we're giving you one month for free. You'll get professional monitoring, Friendly Faces, and more for 30 more days!"<br/>5. Hoping for a better experience with Wyze, I signed up for this trial "extension" hoping to "have enough time to understand why it's so great," just as the email specified.<br/>6. I was then charged for annual service because, contrary to the direct words of Wyze's communication with me, this was not an extension of the trial, but rather a new trial for a separate camera that did not exist.<br/>7. The worse part of all of this has been the customer service. To make matters much worse, I reached out to customer service because I was expecting "30 more days" of an "extended" trial, as Wyze said I'd get, but instead, I was charged. They explained that their confusing communication was not what they said it would be. I'd reached out via email and then asked to speak to someone over the phone about the matter, but they said email was the best way to resolve the issue. They did offer a refund; however, still trying to see the positive in their service, I was interested in the possibility of resolving the issue in some other way. Frustratingly, every time they emailed back, they switched the customer service agent attending my case; what's worse, the new person did not take the time to review the notes so they could pick up where the last person left off, but instead answered the same initial question again, so the conversation didn't progress forward. This went on for several days. I have a hard time understanding how they were not interested in making right Their mistakes by some means other than discarding a new customer, who was once excited about their service.<br/><br/>The Wyze App has a nice interface, but is sometimes glitchy and unreliable (3 out of 10).<br/>Wyze's Customer Service agents are friendly, but they do not appear to consider customer perspectives in how they resolve their issues, and it seems like they're all reading from a script, rather than considering about customer needs (2 out of 10).<br/>The Wyze v3 Cam is fine. Affordable, easy set up and clear enough picture, though I wish it picked up sound a bit better (8 out of 10).<br/>Noonlight Home Monitoring Service is extremely responsive and adds to my sense of safety (10 out of 10).<br/><br/>Would I recommend this? Mneh...not sure. The camera/products and monitoring service are great, but if the app glitches prevent you from accessing them, and the customer service agents notoriously do not help resolve your frustrations, what is it really worth? Does it really give you peace of mind? I'm very disappointed and sad to be posting this review.</span>

<span>I bought 2 of these cameras and so far the picture/video quality is great but I get a lot of false motion notifications. I’m also figuring out now that these cameras are more for close range and not long distance. At times the camera will pickup actual motion in the distance and other times it doesn’t detect anything at all . The app you have to use with this camera setup is in need of some help. But all in all the pictures/videos are very good quality it’s just not designed for what I needed.</span>

<span>It was so easy to set this up and connect to the app. I bought this camera so that we could just pay once for a memory card and not have an ongoing subscription to store the captures.<br/><br/>I turned the motion sensor down all the way and we still get a few false positives from the garbage truck going by, but that’s our fault for not angling it down enough.<br/><br/>We don’t have a place to screw in a mount, so we used Gorilla putty to mount the camera to the door frame. It works perfectly and the camera battery lasts a long time.<br/><br/>Make sure to get an SD card, and I think it had to connect with 2.4 internet, not 5G. I highly recommend this camera and I’m glad we didn’t buy a more expensive version. I review all the videos on my phone and the picture is clear.

<span>I bought this camera to keep an eye on my apartment anytime I leave and it works great! The app is so easy to use and all the settings and options are very easy to understand and customize. It detected motion perfectly and switched over to night vision without any issues. The live view was also easy to access from my phone even when I was in another city. You don't need a cloud subscription for this device. It will snap a photo of the event and alert you, or if you put an SD card in, it will record a short video based on the settings you choose. All accessible though your phone. The battery life is very decent as well. I charged it fully and ran it for 2 weeks and it was still at 63%. I highly recommend this camera if you are just looking for a simple wireless security solution.</span>

<span>Someone’s been stealing my Packages from USPS delivery. After filing five complaints after five separate incidents, I was forced to take matters into my own hands and begin to research wireless outdoor video cameras. Price was an important factor. Some were way too expensive. Others were way too cheap which translates into not working well From my experience. This camera was right in the middle for me so I decided to take it shot and I ordered it. It arrived quickly,  I believe overnight If I’m remembering correctly. Found a good place for it to be mounted. Drilled three screws into the mounting plate into the wall. Was surprisingly easy to link up to my Wi-Fi and the app actually works fairly well. I haven’t had any complaints or issues with it at all. I was expecting to have them but I dont… what is the app was downloaded in the camera hook to my Wi-Fi… I took it outside and Screwed the camera onto the mounting bracket and boom It’s been running for a week now. You can go to the app and select events in the camera will take a snapshot of any motion detected which is pointing right at my mailbox. It probably doesn’t catch every single image but what it has done is deterred whatever shenanigans were happening as I put a sign that said smile with an arrow pointing over to where the camera is on the mailbox. Since then I have received five or six packages with no problems. So it fixed my thief issue. The camera has not even lost really a single bar in battery after one week. I bought a little $10 Amazon 128 gig memory card and put in there and it popped right in and then it started recording videos of each motion. It Hass to be hooked to Wi-Fi and it won’t work off-line but it does work well. I was cautiously cynical about thinking this probably wouldn’t work well and I was going to get it more as a deterrent for people to know there was a camera that might stop the issue which I did so far. But I gotta be honest,  it actually works really well. After one week of multiple recorded events each day and camera access by me throughout each day…the only thing I can report is I’m very pleased with this product. I’m glad I purchased it and I would do it again I considered buying another one as you compare multiple cameras for the same app. If Things take a nose dive after regular use and it stops functioning properly I’ll update this review but so far very pleased and I would recommend</span>

<span>I purchased this camera for use as a security measure pointing to my front porch and driveway through the window in my living room. It works very well and has many useful settings. The night vision is better that others that I have tried but still lacks a bit when very dark. Keep in mind you're only paying $30.00, so you do get what you pay for. The one thing that I feel could use improvement is for the motion detection, it needs a "person detection" mode. There is a sensitivity adjustment which is good, but I have a lot of squirrels in my area and they like to come up on the front porch. I am having a hard time finding just the right sensitivity level to keep from getting squirrel alerts, instead of just person alerts, especially with varying lighting. The camera serves its purpose though, and does it quite well for what it costs.<br/>Thank you for a good product!</span>

<span>When we first purchased cams back in 2017, we compared to Arlo and Ring before we chose Blink. Now we are up to 10 cams, covering every angle of the house. Here are my findings after using them for almost 4 years (and still buying more):<br/>PROS:<br/>&gt; #1 video quality is excellent. Day time is a bit better than night, but night vision is as good as it gets with cams.  POSITION of your cam matters a ton. I started out putting them way high up and quickly realized - if you actually want identifying features - they need to be lower. Otherwise... yeah you see someone walking past, but you cant ID anything, so what is the use.<br/>&gt; So inexpensive - so easy to integrate. Anytime we have ANYTHING we need to cover, we just order another cam and it literally takes 5 minutes to get it out of the box, batteries in, and added to existing system.. seriously - 5 minutes.<br/>&gt; The app is great. Very intuitive. Our first cams had very few "advanced features" every time i order new cams, they have improved their features. Now you are able to zoom all the way in to very small areas, to capture certain areas  and exclude others.. For example - old cams you had to block off large sections of the capture area to avoid the cams picking up movement from trees, but now you can pinpoint one little part of a branch on a tree to exclude if its triggering the cam.<br/>&gt; Motion detection is very sensitive - but they have it tweaked just about right. It never misses anything, but if you setup your exclusion zones well - you can get it almost perfect. I dont have a lot of false alarms and I'm running 10 cams. We have one setup to look at the sidewak, and after much tweaking, we can actually exclude the street... but pick up both sidewalks on both sides of the street. You can setup the app to alert you or not alert you.. you can turn sound on or off on alerts. On windy days I do end up just going into the app and turning off all cams that are setup around lots of trees until the storm is over.. but thats like a few times a year.<br/>&gt; Super easy playback and control of cams. It's instant - you can control them in any way, very easily. If I am working on a project in the yard, I dont want my cams on for hours, running out of batteries - so I just go into the app and turn them all off. It takes seconds. Likewise - if i hear a noise at night, super easy to open the app and live view any cam so i can look all around the house and see everything happening outside, from every angle.<br/>&gt; Extremely easy to move around. We have had them for years - so we move them around occasionally. I even had mice in our crawlspace under the house at one point and just grabbed one of the cams off the side of the house and stuck it down there so I could catch them at night. Theres no commitment with these - no hard wiring so you can mount them anywhere and taking them on and off the mount takes 2 seconds.<br/>&gt; No subscription needed to store clips. thats BIG for us. We would not like blink as much if they changed that. We run a lot of cams and it just stays 100% full storage - we can still access a few weeks worth of video, it just deletes oldest. You can download/save any videos.<br/>&gt; Lots of mounting options. You have to buy them separately if you want anything special, but I have 3 different types of mounts - one for trees, one around porches that need to be secured so they cant be taken, and then the standard mounts for cams not at risk of being taken. There are camo skins as well - I have on in a tree that you pretty much cant see unless you know its there.<br/>&gt; Customer support is super decent. In the winter of 2018, one of my cams took on a green hue to the image when the temp went down to about 10 degrees outside. I emailed customer service explaining the issue and sent a screenshot and within 24 hours they asked me for the SN of the cam, and did a firmware update that fixed it. I was quite happy with that.<br/>CONS:<br/>&gt; So while the batteries are awesome because the cams are so easy to move around and deal with... i blow through batteries. Fortunately, i just get 20 packs of AA's, but with 10 cams - even though Blink ~says~ batteries can last a year? it totally depends on usage. So we get LOTS of traffic on our front cams because we live in a busy area and have people walking past all day. I change out the batteries on every one of those front cams once a month. Granted - thats many hundreds of video captures and ideally, we should connect those cams to electricity somehow - that is an option with blink, but I dont mind changing batteries. On the cams in the back yard and side paths - I really can go once or twice a year changing those, except for the ones that catch a lot of foot traffic. So the battery usage is totally dependent on traffic. Personally - the cams are a big deal to me, so i dont mind it at all. Benefits totally outweigh the downsides.<br/>&gt; The biggest difference between Blink and some other companies is that i see other people with hardwired cams that can catch EVERYTHING in a continuous fashion, for hours. like the surveillance videos you see online where the cam just happened to catch something happening down the street...Blink doesnt work that way. it only captures immediate video clips, triggered by motion activation. It does store all videos.. you can see something weird in your yard and look back through videos to find out what happened - but it isnt 24 hours of continuous video feed.<br/>&gt; You can get gaps in your videos. So it can capture 1 minute of video at a time, but then it takes a small break before it starts capturing again, so if something is happening and its videotaping an event - it will record an entire minute of excellent footage - but then it takes a 5 second break before it starts recording again. that doesnt sound like a long time, and for security it's not normally an issue.. the average bad guy is in and out quickly.. but it is annoying that it takes 5 seconds to re-trigger. So.... 2 minutes of continuous video... but in the middle of that 2 minutes.. a 5 second break.<br/>OVERALL - Super high video quality... cams you can move around super easily... a very easy app... I love blink and the upsides far outweigh any downsides. I always recommend it to people when they ask. You can cover your entire house at a super affordable price, you dont need to be rich at all.. Our 3 year old cams are still as good as our brand new ones. The peace of mind the cams bring me is priceless. I know every single thing happening everywhere, all the time outside. The affordability made it possible so that nothing can ever surprise us.</span>

<span>I was fortunate to buy in early on the Blink camera system. Therefore, I have the included cloud coverage. Only recently did I find out just what an advantage that was.<br/><br/>After buying my initial system, I continued to add cameras to the initial sync module. I ultimately ended up having two additional sync modules from systems I purchased after the original system. I was under the impression that all my cameras had to be connected to the original sync module to continue receiving free cloud coverage.<br/><br/>I currently have a mixture of cameras to include 3-XT2, 4-Outdoor, 1-Indoor (2nd gen) and 2-Mini. I was using a schedule to arm the cameras, but I was disappointed that the system would not allow individual scheduling for each camera.<br/><br/>I recently decided to use my additional sync modules to divide my cameras into different zones and allow myself to set different schedules for each zone. Even if it meant the additional modules would not include free cloud coverage, I felt the scheduling control would be worth it.<br/><br/>I was happily surprised to find that even the newer modules set up under the original system included free cloud coverage. Therefore, I now have three different zones that can be individually scheduled. And furthermore, I can add up to 10 cameras to each module.<br/><br/>I only ran into one problem with the setup. The second module I had purchased had been sitting in the box for probably about a year. When I tried to add a camera to it, it would not connect. I called customer support and the first person wasn’t able to help me. I decided to investigate the problem myself and noticed there was a huge difference in the firmware on the second module.<br/><br/>I expected that the firmware of the second module would automatically update, and there was no way to initiate an update within the App. Since it didn’t automatically update, I called customer service back and told them the problem. The individual I spoke with didn’t seem to understand the issue, so I simply insisted that the module’s firmware had to be updated by them.<br/><br/>It took a number of increments to finally update the firmware once the issue had been escalated to the appropriately skilled technician. I insisted that the customer service representative stay on the line until the firmware of the second module exactly matched that of the existing module. I wasn’t trying to go through another 30 minute hold and 20 minute update again.<br/><br/>After the firmware was updated, I was able to add cameras to the second module. I will monitor the module to make sure future firmware updates occur.<br/><br/>I realize that the cloud coverage or camera support may change or discontinue in the future. But for the time being, I’m quite happy with my Blink system.</span>

<span>I've had the system for more than two years now and to be honest, it's pretty good.<br/>A- Though limited in exactly how far it can see at night, (From garage to end of driveway just beyond my parked vehicles), it triggers nicely.<br/>B- I love how where in the view, you can set the motion tracking. (There's a grid you can use to tell it where to watch for motion in the image. AKA: I can filter it to NOT trigger off my neighbors headlights)<br/>C- I love being able to bring up the live view of any camera on your system. (It takes a few seconds and it will ask you after about 10-15 seconds if you want to continue, so there's that.)<br/>D- It's weird how I keep getting videos popping up from previous nights, (not last night, but several nights previous). And sometimes the replay injects weird, full daytime looking imagery in the playback.<br/>E- Love how I can upload from within the app to my YouTube (or wherever) channel.<br/>F- IT IS A REAL BATTLE swapping out batteries.<br/>F1 - Once the camera is dismounted from the base, it's super easy to unscrew and replace batteries, and closing it back up.<br/>F2 - Snapping it back into their mounts is a real (expletive)ing battle. Knowing I have to tackle that makes me dread the battery change.<br/>F3 - If I were to add a photo to this review, it would be of my grimacing painfully while trying to pop the cameras back into their base.<br/>G - Yes, the Lithium batteries do last 2 years... but it's dependent on how much you use the cameras interactively. If you use them to look at blind spots around your house, the batteries for those particular cameras will poop out faster, but that's a minor nit, though I try to use them sparingly to not have to deal with issue F!!!<br/>H - Love how I can talk to someone through the cameras and hear them very well.<br/>I - I DO NOT appreciate the fine detail when a nighttime spider rudely crawls across the lens!  Ick.<br/>J - I live in the HOT and FREEZING desert and they've held up well through the seasons so far.<br/>K - Love how I can customize exactly when the system will turn on and off.<br/>That is all I can think of for the moment.<br/>OH - I wish I could access my cameras from a desktop and not be limited to just my phone.<br/>OK.. now that is all... for now.</span>

<span class="cr-original-review-content">Empecemos por decir que lo que ofrece el producto es lo que vas a obtener ni mas ni menos.<br/><br/>El producto es totalmente inalámbrico , lo que le da ventajas a la hora de una instalación limpia rápida y sin cables a simple vista.<br/><br/>La conexión vía remota desde el celular a través de app es genial y muy fluida, cuando quieres ver los videos, aunque la conexión con mi dispositivo echo show 5 a sido casi imposible para el control de voz y para la visión en vivo tiene un delay bastante desagradable.<br/><br/>La duración de las baterías es excelente tengo 5 camaras instaladas y una de ellas esta en la entrada del conjunto residencial, lo que hace que diariamente este por las 70 notificaciones de movimiento promedio con sus respectivos videos y aun después de un mes dice que esta sobre el 70% de vida.<br/><br/>Las notificaciones son casi que en tiempo real max unos 10 a 15 seg después de la detección de movimiento llega la notificación a la app de celular, pero la conexión con alexa en mi caso a sido terrible y bastante deprimente porque me decidí por el producto justo por esa función y no he podido darle solución a los errores constantes entre alexa y el skill de blink.<br/><br/>Ahora indaguemos mas en lo tecnico y por lo cual me ha decepcionado un poco el sistema.<br/><br/>Este no es un sistema de vigilancia de video es mas en mi opinión un sistema de alarma de movimiento con capacidad de grabar el evento que activo la señal de alarma, aunque muchas veces ese video termina por frustrarte mas y a continuación explico el porque<br/><br/>El sistema solo puede grabar entre 5 seg y 60 seg de grabación y aunque a veces 60seg es mucho tiempo, tiene una opción que permite parar el video antes si el movimiento se detiene, pero aca es donde comienza el problema en realidad, si activas esta opción, el sistema tiene una contra que la camara al desactivarse tarda 10 seg en volver a estar lista para registrar otra alerta lo cual hace que a veces pierdas información valiosa en cuanto a seguridad, si el movimiento para y luego se reactiva mientras la camara esta en el reposo de los 10seg, la camara no registrara nada en video y si el intruso sale fuera del rango de detección ya no podrás saber que paso luego, incluso si el movimiento llegar a seguir después de los 60seg max de grabación por alerta, la camara entraría en ese mismo tiempo de descanso de 10seg.<br/><br/>Aunque las alertas en la app son muy rápidas este Tiempo se puede ver afectado si la opción  de alertas rápidas no esta activada, ya que esta viene desactivada por defecto y si no se activa en cada camara puedes tener unas que te avisen y otras que las notificaciones llegue siempre tarde o después que ya se detecto el movimiento.<br/><br/>En resumen si lo que quieres es un sistema de alerta de movimiento o cercanía este es el sistema que debería comprar pero si quieres un sistema de vigilancia de video busca otras opciones.<br/><br/>Dentro de amazon hay varias opciones de camara ptz wifi con grabación continua, detección de movimiento, alarma sonora y audio doble vía que trabaja muy similar a este sistema y con una memoria de 32gb tienes hasta 4 dias de grabación continua y son mas económicos, aunque no son tan excelentes como este en visión de video en vivo o revisando archivos de alarma te serán mas útiles si lo que buscas es un sistema cctv, por lo menos en mi opinión.<br/><br/>Postdata aun no se como funciona el sistema sin la membresía a Blink plus aun estoy dentro de la  prueba gratis y aunque ya tengo todo el sistema para grabación local pronto volveré con mi opinión de como se porta el sistema una ves no tengas el soporte de Blink Plus.<br/><br/>--------------------------------------------------------<br/><br/>Let's start by saying that what the product offers is what you are going to get, no more, no less.<br/><br/>The product is completely wireless, giving you the advantage of a quick clean installation without wires at a glance.<br/><br/>The remote connection from the cell phone through the app is great and very fluid, when you want to watch the videos, although the connection with my echo show 5 device has been almost impossible for voice control and for live viewing it has a delay quite unpleasant.<br/><br/>The duration of the batteries is excellent, I have 5 cameras installed and one of them is at the entrance of the residential complex, which means that every day there are 70 average movement notifications with their respective videos and even after a month it says that it is over 70% life batteries.<br/><br/>Notifications are almost in real time, max about 10 to 15 seconds after motion detection, the notification arrives on the mobile app, but the connection with alexa in my case has been terrible and quite depressing because I decided on the right product for that function and I have not been able to solve the constant errors between alexa and the blink skill.<br/><br/>Now let's dig deeper into the technical and for which the system has disappointed me a bit.<br/><br/>This is not a video surveillance system, it is more in my opinion a motion alarm system with the ability to record the event that activated the alarm signal, although many times that video ends up frustrating you more and I will explain why below.<br/><br/>The system can only record between 5sec and 60sec of recording and although sometimes 60sec is a long time, it has an option that allows you to stop the video earlier if the movement stops, but this is where the problem really starts, if you activate this option, the system has a counter that when the camera is deactivated, it takes 10 seconds to be ready again to record another alert, which sometimes means that you lose valuable information regarding security, if the movement stops and then reactivates while the camera is At rest for 10 seconds, the camera will not record anything on video and if the intruder goes out of the detection range, you will no longer be able to know what happened next, even if the movement continues after the maximum 60 seconds of recording by alert, the camera would enter that same rest time of 10sec.<br/><br/>Although the alerts in the app are very fast, this Time can be affected if the quick alerts option is not activated, since it is deactivated by default and if it is not activated in each camera you can have some that notify you and others that Notifications always arrive late or after motion has already been detected.<br/><br/>No me In short, if what you want is a movement or proximity alert system, this is the system you should buy, but if you want a video surveillance system, look for other options.<br/><br/>Within amazon there are several wifi ptz camera options with continuous recording, motion detection, sound alarm and two-way audio and lights that works very similar to this system and with a 32gb memory you have up to 4 days of continuous recording and they are cheaper, although They are not as excellent as this one in viewing live video or reviewing alarm files.  They will be more useful if you are looking for a cctv system, at least in my opinion. Postscript I still don't know how the system works without Blink plus membership I'm still in the free trial and although I already have the entire system for local recording I'll soon come back with my opinion on how the system behaves once you don't have Blink support Plus.</span><span class="cr-translated-review-content aok-hidden"></span>

<span>I was looking for a flood light for my driveway that had wonderful color night vision. The Arlo floodlight has not disappointing so far. I also purchased the charging cable because I didn’t wanna have to worry about batteries or solar I just wanted to direct power source. The light is very bright I actually even had to tone it back some on the app because it was blindingly bright lol. It has wonderful color night vision,  great sound And picks up pictures very clearly. I also like the fact that you can turn on a siren if anything seems suspicious. I wanted to flood light so it would pick up great pictures at night in addition to the fact that it lights up my driveway very nicely without having to turn on the house lights. It is a great security issue at night. I have it set up so it shows my whole driveway and who is coming to my front door. And that’s all I really needed it for and I love it. Would definitely buy again and would definitely refer to my friends and family</span>

<span>I like this camera. The lights are bright, the field of view is wide, the picture crisp. So why four stars? Because there is a lag in the recording. If someone appears in the frame of view, there's probably a five or six second delay before recording starts. In some cases, that's enough time to walk through frame and the camera wouldn't capture anything. Fortunately I have a long lead up to my camera so even if someone is halfway there, they're still on camera part of the time. But it's something to consider.</span>

<span>I would highly recommended this camera. It’s efficient, easy to use and I am a single mom with 2 kids. I am telling I feel so safe knowing I have these cameras. I had an issue where one went offline and I couldn’t even figure out the issue. However I contacted the manufacturer via email. It was the most easiest process I’ve ever seen. I couldn’t understand what the kind gentleman was saying via email so I requested he call me. Not only did he send me a replacement and never asked for the defective one back but He called me immediately and assisted me to get the new camera and the defective one working again. He told me to keep all of them and he was so kind, professional and he knew exactly what he was doing. I spent 3 days attempting to fix the device he walked me through the process in less than 5 minutes both were back on line. Mr. Justin went above and beyond to ensure me and my family were safe and I couldn’t be more grateful for his actions.<br/><br/>Thanks Justin and thank you LaView it is truly appreciated.</span>
