<blockquote><em><div class="a-row a-spacing-small review-data"><span class="a-size-base review-text review-text-content" data-hook="review-body">
<span>I got a replacement and it's exactly what I wanted! Lightweight and the learning curve isn't so bad if you've never used a chromebook before, it only took me a few days to get used to it. It's very different from a normal computer and only good for light browsing and writing, I also got a large micro sd card for storage since it's barely got any, but I love it!<br/><br/>OLD REVIEW:<br/>The laptop itself is adorable, I love the look and feel of it, but I was either sent a broken computer or it was broken by the postal service handling it too roughly. It booted quickly, at least, so my disappointment was immediate. :(<br/><br/>I've put in for a replacement, so I'll be updating my review once that one arrives in two days.</span>

<span>Day one, and the Ideapad 3 started right up. I'm going to let it charge for a while before I complete the setup. One star deducted for no English setup instructions in the box.<br/><br/>Day 3. Just discovered it isn't a touch screen. No biggie, I hate touch screens anyway. I'm using a small wireless mouse, and it works fine. I'm not sure how much internal memory this unit has, but I just stuck a 64 gb sd card in it so that'll be fine.<br/><br/>I bought this for a specific meeting - to see if I could drive a presentation on a large screen tv without having to bring a full featured laptop or tablet and to see if I'd like a Chromebook better than a tablet. Today, I hooked this little Lenovo Chromebook up to a big screen via the usb c port and it works fine. Had to buy the special cable with the HDMI on the other end but it was inexpensive and it came the next day from Amazon. What I really like about this little gem (if it continues to work...) is that it has regular usb ports as well - 2 of them! My Lenovo M10 tablet has none and thus there's no way to input or output data via cable. This is proving to be an interesting experiment.</span>

<span>This is a great little chromebook for the price.  My only issue were no touch screen and wasn't loading apps I need for school and work.  Would recommend though</span>

<span>This is my first Chromebook, and I've been using it for two days.  The battery life is amazing so far; it does appear to be 10 hours. Reading the reviews, it seems like a wide range of experiences, and I feel fortunate that mine works well so far.<br/><br/>It was very easy to set up. I saw 11.5 in the description, but the actual display screen is 10 inches. It isn't a touch screen, and the keys are dark gray, not black. This was an impulse purchase after getting a new laptop a few days ago. My 6 year old Dell would work no longer, and I got an expensive gaming laptop. It was my second one, but I was not expecting it to get so hot, with a noisy fan. The battery life is about an hour. To feel more comfortable, I wanted a Chromebook for email, YouTube, and Amazon videos. So, this is doing what I want it to.<br/>I will likely get more used to having no delete key, instead the alt+backspace key is used for that function.  I was surprised when my bookmark bar appeared with bookmarks from 2013 on. I've deleted many of them in the bookmark manager.<br/>My main dissatisfaction is the disappearing vertical scroll bar. In some emails, you can select "view in<br/>browser". I would be more frustrated if I didn't have the laptop available. There might be a fix for that; I haven't researched yet.<br/>I purchased mine when it was 52% off, which is worth it.  Buying electronics is risky. I've been very disappointed in the past, which is why I'm relieved and accepting of the machine I got.<br/>Almost everything has become more expensive, and reasonable expectations seem to be in order. With two days use, I'm not regretting my purchase.</span>

<span>I had a previous version of this laptop before so after four years I decided to get a replacement and gift my old one to a friend.  The laptop works great just like the last one.  It's perfect for basic work like office suites and surfing the web,  It is lightweight and I take it with me when living abroad.  The only issue I have with it is that even though I have the power management set to shut entirely down with either the lid closed or pressing the power button, The battery isn't holding the charge.  I can fully charge it, shut down and unplug it; in about three days, it will be about 35 percent battery life.  However, I don't know if its MS 11 or the Hardware itself.  Other than that, I love the Asus product line and this little laptop. Just don't expect it to be fully charged if you leave it unplugged after a few days.</span>

<span>I'm giving this little engine that could five stars. Why? Well, it's two hundred dollars. So I'm reviewing it as a two hundred dollar product. If I was comparing it to a Macbook Air M1, it would probably be three stars. If I was comparing it to a Microsoft Surface, three and a half. But it's a small, budget laptop, and in that category, it's excellent.<br/><br/>QUICK RUNDOWN - It blows my mind how good of a job they did with this. I've used a lot of computers, and this one impresses me. If you've ever had a Chromebook, or even just a cheap (or perhaps even more expensive) laptop you'll feel the difference immediately. It has a few issues, none of which are deal breakers, but it has many, many pros. Read on.<br/><br/>PROS --<br/>Incredible Price to Performance Ratio<br/>Very well built, with no cheap parts<br/>Full-size, comfortable keyboard<br/>Small and lightweight<br/>Good design (add stickers if it's a little too plain for you)<br/>Full Windows 10 License, and no hardwired bloatware<br/>Internal NVMe slot and external SD Card slot<br/>I could keep going... it's $200.<br/><br/>CONS --<br/>No backlight keyboard (at least on the 11.6 model)<br/>Some irksome viewing angle problems<br/>Maddeningly little built in storage<br/>Almost too little RAM<br/>Realtek Wifi Card (explained why in the 'Linux' section)<br/><br/>I've divided the review into individual sections: webcam, speakers, performance, software, etc, so scroll down to the one that's most important to you, or read the review from top to bottom. They are (in order):<br/><br/>Introduction (above)<br/>Weight &amp; Build<br/>Keyboard and Trackpad<br/>Screen<br/>Battery<br/>Performance (including Gaming)<br/>Webcam<br/>Speakers &amp; Sound<br/>Software<br/>Linux<br/>Other (SD Card Slot, NVMe slot, HDMI output, heating, cleaning)<br/>Conclusion<br/><br/>Let me start with a few disclaimers. First, I've only been using it for a few weeks, which is about enough time to get a good sense of its mettle and iron out any problems it has. There's been a few things I've noticed that I've added to this review, (see 'performance' and 'screen') and I'll add more if more arise. No problem has been significant enough that it made me in any way wonder if it was worth. $200 is a really good price point.<br/><br/>The second disclaimer, is there's a few reviewers saying either A, they got a dud, or B, it clunked out on them after two years. Duds happen, with any product, this is no exception. So if mine does decided to go on the fritz, I'll update my review relative to the exchange process - I WON'T deduct stars *just* because it gave out. Second, if you get two years of solid use out of this, it's a good product. Just buy another one.<br/><br/>With that being said, let me get into the details.<br/><br/>WEIGHT AND BUILD - This is one of its greatest strengths, and rivals many laptops in higher price ranges. There's no creaks, no cheap plastic waiting to shatter, it's not a flimsy toy. It's a solid electronic. It feels right, in your hands, on your lap, on a desk. So many laptops try and woo you with larger screens or better specs [or, for the life of me, a lower price tag], and turn out to be cup coasters you have to plug in. Not this. It really feels like it has some life in it.<br/><br/>It's not obscenely light, like a MacBook Air, but you can move about and use it on your lap without strain. If traveling's your kind of thing, then the weight is sufficient. I would feel comfortable carrying it through an airport.<br/><br/>The screen hinge feels durable and like it won't be breaking anytime soon, and when you set it at the position you like, it stays. The laptop isn't super-ultra-mega thin, but it is thin, and that's a nice bonus. You could probably fit it in an envelope, just maybe a slightly larger envelope then the one Steve Jobs used.<br/><br/>KEYBOARD AND TRACKPAD - The keyboard, I'm in love with. It's full size; no cramping on tiny keys or accidentally presses. The give is decisive and gratifying, and it just feels good to use. The keyboard is actually the one (literally, the only one) thing I feel they cut a little too close to the corner on. There's no backlight. It appears as those some of the models have a backlight, though I'm not sure, but mine doesn't. (I got the 11.6 model). This can be a little frustrating, and I'm considering getting a book light so I can type in the dark. Again, this is a two hundred dollar laptop, so it is what it is. I'll make due.<br/><br/>Another note, is they put the 'delete' key right next to the power key. Shucks. A few times, I've gone to press the delete key, and the computer goes into sleep mode. This is more of an inconvenience than anything. Just press the power button again and it will start right back up where you left off. Still, if you're doing sensitive work, it's something to consider, and I'm sure you'll learn very quickly to be cautious.<br/><br/>Also, the 'enter' key is green. I thought this was strange, but I really like it. Hard to explain.<br/><br/>The trackpad is responsive and that click is also decisive and gratifying. I don't have any issues accidentally pressing it while I'm typing, and it's very good at doing what I expect it to. If I click or tap, the mouse clicks. If I click on the right, it right clicks. Scrolling is painless and intuitive and very nuanced. The numpad on the keyboard is a nice touch, though I would have traded it for a backlit keyboard.<br/><br/>SCREEN - Going back to where we started, this is a two hundred dollar laptop. You're not getting an Apple Retina display. It has some minor viewing angle problems you'll have to accommodate for. If you're looking directly at it, everything looks good - pure colors, no whitening. If you turn it horizontally or bend the screen back, there's a noticeable change in tone. It is what it is, and it likely won't interfere with your work. Just don't do color grading for professional photoshoots on it.<br/><br/>The screen resolution is just right. The screen is small, but there's enough room to do what you want and then some. This is one of the most significant factors in comfort. If it were cramped, it would give you a headache and strain your eyes. But they did a good job of making sure there's some breathing room with a healthy buffer zone around whatever it is you're focusing on. You feel like you can move and engage in multiple things.<br/><br/>There's a few reviews complaining it's not a touch screen. You can't please everyone. It's not something I feel is missing, especially for $200.<br/><br/>BATTERY - The battery life is on point. The time remaining Windows estimates seems to vary quite a bit, but I watched two movies and used it for 4 hours, and still had 17%. It's the kind of thing you can charge at night and it will last you the day under normal conditions. It also doesn't have quick charge, another little cut corner, but I'm not stressing about it. Then again, I'm around a power outlet most of the time. If quick charge is an issue for you, you're in the wrong price point.<br/><br/>Side note: the charging port really plugs in. You have to give it a little oomph to pull it out. Which can be a pro and a con. You definitely don't want to trip on the cord; the whole thing will go flying off the table. But you can reposition the device without having to worry about the cord falling out.<br/><br/>PERFORMANCE - This is actually one of its biggest strengths, and really surprised me. All the components come together to create a seamless experience. I was nervous about the odd named Intel Processor (N6 something something) but it turns out, it's actually an Intel Celeron. And only four gigs of memory? Doesn't seem like quite enough. But it somehow manages to muscle out the minimum, and have some left over. My guess is, this is largely due to the SSD. Just a few years ago, laptop manufacturers had two options for storage: a physical hard drive, which was expensive, bulky, and a power drain, or some sort of memory like a thumb drive. Both were slow and huge bottle necks.<br/><br/>Well, this thing has a Solid State Drive. And that makes all the difference. With a decent processor, just enough memory, and the SSD, it will breeze through any routine task you ask it to do: open Microsoft Word, surf the web, torrent files, play music, and it will do it all without a hitch. Performance, under reasonable conditions, should never be a problem: you'll never feel a pause or get frustrated.<br/><br/>I LOVE the original Warhammer: 40K: Dawn of War series. This plays it effortlessly, even with mods. Which is very welcomed. I can imagine it can also play Sins of a Solar Empire, Age of Empires, Among Us, Terraria, and maybe even Minecraft, if that's your kind of thing. Check out GOG.com (great old games) and you'll be surprised at what's out there. If you are planning to do some light gaming, the NVMe slot will really come in handy.<br/><br/>IMPORTANT EDIT: After using it for some weeks, the lack of RAM is starting to become an issue. Windows has done a good job managing memory, but even day-to-day tasks can overwhelm it. This expresses itself as stalled applications, dropped Chrome tabs, or even system notifications that the system has run out of Memory. It did reach a significant error, though - everything went black, and after a reboot, Windows wanted to help set up my system (which is a big error.) Luckily everything was intact, my files, settings and programs. So it's just kind of a startling headache.<br/><br/>I was running a few programs, nothing too demanding. So if you're planning on using this for anything more then Spotify and Chrome, be forewarned.<br/><br/>WEBCAM - The webcam is about what you would expect. It's a hefty 0.3 megapixels, but there aren't any dropped frames, and the color processing is alright. If you need a webcam on the fly, it'll due. If you use a webcam for any serious purposes, I would suggest investing in a nice one, which you were probably going to do anyway. The device will be able to handle it without issue.<br/><br/>Of special note, is the microphone, which is actually great. Audio comes through clear and audible, distinct and focused. If you do find yourself in a situation where you have to use the onboard webcam, the video quality won't be great, but you won't have any problem being heard and understood.<br/><br/>SPEAKERS &amp; SOUND - The speakers are placed under the device, pointing directly down. You would think this would make them impossible to hear, but it projects and doesn't distort the sound. I've watched a few movies, and haven't had an issue hearing them - it gets plenty loud. I'm a bit of an audiophile, (though there are many more advance then I), and what I can say about these speakers is they're passable. They're not so bad that you're getting irked with the sound quality, but they're not so good you would enjoy Beethoven's 5th. The various aspects of sound - the bass, and whatever else the other parts are called, are balanced and clear.<br/><br/>If you're using it for casual media use, the lackluster sound quality will fade into the background and you'll be able to enjoy whatever it is you're doing.<br/><br/>The headphone amplifier is decent and it appears they didn't skimp on it. I tested it with a pair of Sony MDR7506s (which are one-for-one studio monitors with a higher than average impedance.) The amplifier didn't quit reach optimal levels, but it produced clear and pleasing sound. (and it does have a nice kick to it.) For an onboard amplifier, it's more then adequate. If you're a real audiophile and use an external amplifier, the primary factor to consider is if the sound it's putting out can be boosted, and it definitely can.<br/><br/>SOFTWARE - There's a few pieces of bloatware you'll want to uninstall. McAfee, Skype, MyAsus. (if you don't know what bloatware is, ask the techy in your family to remove it for you.) Fortunately, none of them are hard coded into the software or hardware, so uninstalling them is straight forward and simple and can be done through 'Add or Remove Programs.' The laptop does come in Windows S mode (which is suppose to be a simpler version of Windows, but has some bothersome limitations for power users.) They made it extremely easy to convert into regular Windows 10. I clicked a button once and haven't had to worry about it since: full Windows 10.<br/><br/>LINUX - I'm not a super user when it comes to Linux. I do know enough to install and use it on a day-to-day basis, and for low-performance computers like this one, Linux is tantalizing. Unfortunately, the WiFi card in the system [as of 11/19/21] doesn't work with Linux and there doesn't seem to be any support on the horizon. Most people who need or prefer Linux have taken to using a USB WiFi antenna, an untenable inconvenience for most. Some people have been reporting switching out the NIC entirely, but I don't know enough to speak about that.<br/><br/>OTHER - What I find really helpful is the SD Card Slot. The 64 gigs of storage it comes with goes REALLY quick. I like to watch, uh, documentaries in public domain (like 'Joker' with Joaquin Phoenix). It's amazingly simple to plug in an SD card (I got a 256gb one for $45), set up uTorrent to load all the unfinished and finished torrents onto the card, and that solves the whole problem. Just about any SD card you buy will be fast enough to download movies and play one at the same time.<br/><br/>Other reviewers have pointed out it comes with a slot for an NVMe SSD. If you don't know what that is, it probably doesn't make much of a difference. If you do, it's a very helpful addition. Hooray.<br/><br/>It has tons of ports, which is great. Two USB ports, a USB-C port, the above mentioned SD card slot, an auxiliary port, and an HDMI port. I've used the HDMI port on a full screen TV, and it works for watching a movie. The quality of the movie file will make a difference - but the sound compression changes that are necessary with downloaded media [generally done through VLC] help a lot. It's not blu-ray, but performance doesn't seem to be affected by what's happening in a scene or the amount of sound.<br/><br/>If you're planning on using this for presentations, it's exactly what you want. Plug, play 'n forget.<br/><br/>During normal, unplugged, use you wouldn't be able to tell that it's turned on just by the heat. If you're running a process-intensive program or have it plugged in, it does heat up, but that's normal. You can use it on your lap without a worrying. I don't see heating being an issue. It's also fanless, which is a big deal if you live in a dusty environment. You won't slowly be running it into the ground just by using it, listening to the fan whir louder and louder as it tries to compensate for all the dust.<br/><br/>Side note: If it overheats, it'll just turn off. It won't hurt it.<br/><br/>I like to take good care of my computers, so ease of cleaning matters to me. Being fanless, that alleviates a lot of of the issues you would come across. Still, you can't access behind the keyboard, so it will be interesting to see how that plays out. You might be able to remove each key and clean it out, which would go a long way, but I wouldn't try it without doing some research and carefully weighing the benefits and risks.<br/><br/>Either way, do yourself a favor: buy a small pack of Q-tips, a little bottle of house hold cleaner (Pinesol works well), and lens clothes, and throw them in the bag or case you're carrying the laptop in. Occasionally go over the keyboard with the Q-tips and wipe down the exterior, and the lens cloth will come in handy a lot more then you think. I don't know if it will necessarily add to the life of the machine, but it will feel a lot better. And it's worth taking some pride in your devices.<br/><br/>CONCLUSION - The bottom line is, is it feels good to use. Everything from the keyboard to the performance to the build quality makes it a very enjoyable and complete experience: there's nothing really lacking that will get in your way. It's spectacular for day-to-day use, and it's got a little muscle to it. For $200, you're getting a real product, and it even has something to say to higher end laptops. If you decide to go with this, I think you'll be very pleased.</span>

<span>After many years of using actual netbooks, I was in the market for something the same shape and size after they discontinued the term. I wanted something that was somewhat future proof and wouldn't crap out after a few windows updates like all of my previous models.<br/><br/>I saw a video review (it is posted on here and elsewhere) and knew this was the netbook for me. The NVME expansion slot plus the SD card reader made this thing elite compared to other models. I popped a 512GB in here and am able to install old video games, my programs, and even a virtual machine or two.<br/><br/>Windows 10 runs flawlessly on this. Bootup times are a breeze. Program loading times can be a bit slow compared to a much higher end model, but for something as light as this, it is incredible how responsive this little engine that can is.<br/><br/>As everyone will tell you, this thing does not game well. It will play games of yesteryear which is exactly what I bought it for, but of course I tested things like Left4Dead, Tower Unite, and a few others. Left4dead barely runs on here even at lowest settings. Farm Together needs render quality dropped to the bare minimum. I was actually expecting it to run some UT3 engine and Source Engine games at minimal settings, but it failed horribly. I also noticed in the bios, there is not much wiggle room to throw more memory at the GPU and I think that is where is struggles outside of the already known single channel memory flaw. So if you are looking for the casual game of Simcity 2000 or Roller Coast Tycoon, this can handle it, just don't expect to play anything after the 1990s.<br/><br/>I have not made the jump to Windows 11 yet and am a little weary because of the 4GB limitation, but it is constantly reminding me to upgrade so I know that it is fully 11 ready for future proofing.<br/><br/>The numpad seems like a cool idea at first, but I had trouble getting the hang of it and often forget it is even there. I think this is a great feature and may serve a college student who isn't used to traditional trackpads very well. My old self is just so used to a traditional laptop, I need to train myself to utilize it.<br/><br/>I love this netbook and would definitely buy another one if there is an upgraded model in the future when this one starts showing age. I highly recommend it to anyone who wants something small with decent storage and great response times.</span>

<span>When you buy this, just know that you won’t have a lot of internal storage to work with. I bought an sd card to handle my storage effectively. When you get close to having the internal storage met, expect performance issues. The computer will work slower and just seem to struggle with keeping up.<br/><br/>This is NOT a gaming laptop. Please consider buying a different laptop if you wanted to game. It really doesn’t have the frame rate to handle games that are large. I used this laptop to play Roblox with students of mine and 9/10 this laptop could not keep up.<br/><br/>As for a work laptop it’s lightweight and easy to use. I use this laptop for zoom meetings(with an external camera, not the internal one), homework, writing and casual browsing. It does this job well. I generally won’t watch anything on it because the audio quality isn’t great, but if I had to use this laptop I would play the audio with headphones or a speaker.<br/><br/>Overall for school, work, or causal browsing Id definitely recommend this laptop.<br/><br/>PS this is not a backlit keyboard.</span>

I never write reviews and I was hesitant to buy because of some of the negative comments about the “tech specs” of this chromebook (idk what they mean anyway). Honestly, it’s great. I can make my slide shows, view videos, and work with all my TPT resources in my drive. Mine was carefully packaged and in perfect condition. It was so easy to plug in and start working! In my opinion- it looks great too! My boyfriend didn’t know I bought it and when he walked in the door and glanced he said “Wait did you get a new MacBook?” Before he saw the “HP” lol! It’s a great little chromebook if you’re looking to do similar day-to-day things for your classroom!

<span>Ok, just to get everything out in one sentence: This is the perfect laptop for the CASUAL laptop user! Which is a good thing!<br/><br/>This is a great little laptop! for $200 this is a steal. 64 gigabytes is enough for windows 10. If you get a 128GB mini SD card, then this laptop will work great for you. Now if you plan on using this to store pictures, videos and other files, for awhile, then you will run out of space (with the laptop alone). But with a mini SD card or a flash drives to store your files, you'll be fine.<br/><br/>If you are a heavy computer user and need it for heavy video editing, photoshop or a heavy gamer, then obviously this won't work for you. I use windows movie maker. It works just fine. This can play light games or games that have been released from the early 2000's (if you play on Steam).. Newer games that need Gforce and what not.. Obviously not. This laptop is for the casual user, but can hold its grounds when using other programs.<br/><br/>I have used adobe elements for video editing.. Does it work. yes, it does! is it the best computer to use it on.. haha, no. But it does work on this laptop, though this isn't the idea computer you'd used a program on like this. But if you're on a tight budget and don't mind the laptop taking a few extra moments to process everything, then go for it.<br/><br/>The keyboard and the mouse pad works like butter. I love typing on this thing. I've typed on several 11.6" laptops and had trouble, but I have no problem typing on this.<br/><br/>GREAT LAPTOP and VERY HAPPY!!</span>

<span>Wow so many good reviews I don't know what to say I hated mine I'm sending it back I had Windows 10 S mode and I got locked out after I think about 10 hours so here is my deal I am not willing to pay money for a computer that locks me out and I have to research how to get into it. I'm going back to Chrome that might be the problem I've been using Chrome for quite a while and it's been a long time since I used Windows just to give the computer the benefit of the doubt I do like the backlight it is a nice computer just not good software for me</span>

<span>The good: I like the back lit keyboard, the fast, quiet solid state memory, the long battery life, the big 15.6 screen.<br/>  Used as a simple school or business tool it is a perfectly good computer.<br/>The not great: The 4gb ram is a limiting factor on this unit.  You cannot ever install additional ram to handle modern software or games, as it has no slots for ram at all. The 4gb ram is simply soldered in to the unit.<br/>Be aware of this when making this purchase.<br/>On the plus side, You can easily greatly expand on the 128gb solid drive by plugging in an internal m.2 SSD card.  An empty m.2 slot is provided. The speed of this computer is only slow when used for multi tasking with intense business software. Regular use is fine, in fact its pretty snappy with good performance. I did have to disable the windows 10 S mode. Disabling 10S is a built in option, allowing a return to regular windows. 10s would not function with the business software and non microsoft add ons I require. I am now running regular windows 10 with no issues.</span>

<span>Like many of the reviews said, the volume is not very loud, but sound is not something I use my computer for a lot. I have a bluetooth speaker that can give me all the volume I want when I do want it. I think the screen is nicer than what some had described, especially at the price point this computer came in at. Also like many reviews said, the keyboard is not backlit as it is described, unless I'm missing something to turn it on. This was not really a big deal to me, but wish it wouldn't be in the description if it don't have it. Otherwise, I've had it for a few days and am enjoying it very much. For what I paid it seems very fast for my use and a great value.</span>

<span>First of all, this is a big upgrade for me. My previous laptop was a Toshiba C55 with Intel i3 4th Gen proccesor, 8gb DDR3 ram and a 256 SSD. I was ok with that laptop but I felt that I needed an upgrade. Man I made the right decision!<br/><br/>This laptop has everything I've wanted in a computer, except the graphics card of course. All in all, I'm really happy with the purchase.<br/><br/>Pros:<br/>1. This laptop is thin and light. I can definitely take this laptop anywhere without noticing that I really have it with me.<br/>2. I've seen some comments that the sound is bad. Well guess what, It's not bad at all. Not the quality of a Mackbook pro, but come on, for the price? It actually sounds pretty good. Those two speakers in the bottom, when hitting against the table, it bounces off giving a really good base sound, allthough they have the potential to get a bit louder, but that aside, it's great for a laptop this thin.<br/>3. Others say that the screen is horrible. I don't see anything horrible about it. It's not full IPS quality, but the 1080p screen looks pretty good. Again, taking you back to the price, can't beat it.<br/>4. The backlit keyboard is beautiful! Even though the keyboard needs a bit more work (make it feel more clicky), the white backlit makes this laptop look like a pro when putting it side by side with other well known brands out there.<br/>5. There's enough peripherals for what I need. Comes with 2 USB's on the left side, 1 USB-A on the right side, HDMI, USB-C and the sd card slot. Not bad for the size of this laptop. Enough for a thin laptop. Unfortunately it didn't come with an ethernet port, which I use a lot for a more stable connection, but that's what external usb network arapters are for.<br/>6. Extra slot for another 2.5 HDD/SSD. Not many laptops at this price range have that, so I'm really glad this one does in case I want to expand my storage a bit more.<br/>7. The battery life is just great. The first time I fully charged it, I used it for about 5 hours and it still had some juice left. I think I could have used it up to 6 hours for me to charge it back again. I used it with minimum backlit brightness and about half screen brightness. Not bad at all. Oh, and the charging time, amazing, from 10% to 100% in about an hour, could have been less<br/><br/>Cons:<br/>1. The flex cable adapter for the additional internal HDD/SDD is not included in the box. I believe this should be included all the time for all of the laptops that offer the chance to expand the storage. Not much of a biggie though, you can find that adapter in amazon for about 12 bucks.<br/>2. Cannot upgrade the ram further than 16gb + the integrated 4gb that's soldered into the motherboard. This is unfortunate since it would have been a great oportunity to add some options to update the RAM to 32gb.<br/><br/>As you can see, there are way more pros than cons, so you can definitely tell that I really like this laptop. Give it a try, I totally recommend it.</span>

<span>I personally love this laptop, in fact, I'm writing this review on this laptop, but that's only because it's the right laptop for my needs. This laptop is not for everyone, because I don't believe it's all that practical to be used for multimedia purposes, AKA, gaming and streaming, etc. There are specific reasons why I say this, and one of the reasons for that, is yes, just like the other reviewers say, the screen is a bit to be desired.<br/><br/>First, I'd like to say that the screen isn't bad, it's just not great. It is a full HD display, but you do pretty much have to look straight at it to get a clear picture. You can see it okay from certain angles, but nothing too fancy. That's why I don't think it's good for multimedia, for example, if you want a laptop to stream movies and watch shows with friends and family, I would not recommend this laptop. It'll stream it just fine, because this computer is very fast, but the picture won't give a clear picture to a group of people watching it. However, if it was you, then I'd say go for it.<br/><br/>The other reason why I don't think this laptop is good for multimedia use, is because of the audio. I am going to be brutally honest when I say that the audio on this laptop is absolutely horrible. I put max volume on my Spotify, and it the volume was so unimpressive, that I could comfortably hold a conversation with someone next to it. So, not only will the screen give a person issues, but unless you have a good speaker connected, you're not going to hear any music, shows, or movies very well with this one.<br/><br/>I also don't recommend gaming on this laptop, not just for the reasons already stated above, but because of performance. This computer can perform very well at several multimedia tasks in terms of processor and memory, and you could play some simple games. But the moment you talk about WoW, or Overwatch... well, let's just say I don't believe this laptop was designed to be a gaming laptop.<br/><br/>That all being said, I love this computer because I don't need a laptop for gaming, or for multimedia purposes. I am a writer, and I also love doing research, and doing basic stuff like checking email, or Reddit. For those basic tasks, this computer is actually quite phenomenal. Because of the SSD (Solid State Drive for those that don't know), it boots up very fast. It could be completely off, and from the time I push the button to turn it on, to the time the computer is ready for whatever task I want to do, barely 4 or 5 seconds have passed. That is not an exaggeration!<br/><br/>The battery lasts for several hours, as long as you're smart about it. Like making sure the light on the keyboard is either off or low, when using the battery, and turning the screen brightness down. You can google tricks like that to extend battery life on all kinds of electronics, but as long as you do those basic things, the battery should last at least 6-7 hours.<br/><br/>The processor is super fast, and I never have to wait more than seconds, if that, for the computer to act on anything I do. The moment I click on Google Chrome, the browser and my personal front page is up in less than 2 seconds. This computer is very fast, and despite what I've said before about the screen and audio, it actually does stream Netflix and all the other streaming apps pretty well.<br/><br/>To anyone wanting to play games, watch movies with friends/family, or listen to loud music, I would not recommend this laptop. However, if you want a laptop to do everything else, I would not only recommend this laptop, but I would even go so far as to say that it's the best one on the market, for its price.</span>

<span>Item #1 below is focused on Windows 10 S Mode. I didn't intend to write so much about S Mode, but I did so and thus it is there for you to consider. The rest of the comments made are about the Asus laptop itself.<br/><br/>1.) I find Windows 10 S Mode to be excellent. The more I use it, the more I like it. {I've used S Mode on other devices for about 8-months.) You can exit S Mode easily, but I say it is really an awesome and an under rated OS. It virtually blocks malware, period. You can't tell the laptop is in S Mode unless you try to install something from outside of the Windows Store. Unless you are a gamer or need some special program, S Mode should be considered. It can save you a lot of concern about being compromised by hacking, which is becoming more of a concern of late, especially with the increase in sophistication in attacks from nation states and organized crime. Yep, I'm a techy with an opposing view to the techie press. Seems they mostly trash Windows 10 S Mode, but they rarely seem to articulate the benefits of S Mode. I think Microsoft should do a better job of marketing the OS. Why they don't is beyond me.<br/><br/>I upgraded from Windows 10 Home to Windows 10 Pro via the Windows Store. I then as an admin joined this device to Office 365's Intune. I realize the tech world seems to talk down Windows 10 S Mode, but I am a contrarian and think it is outstanding. Also, S Mode requires way less Windows updates than regular Windows so, again, I am a fan. As an admin, I don't need to concern myself with updates as much. This OS is really hard to compromise.<br/><br/>2.) This laptop is an outstanding value for the price. It has and i3 Intel processor, 8GB of RAM, and a 128GB SSD hard drive. Really, this is perfect configuration for the average business or college user. The performance is excellent for what it is equipped with. The i3 Intel chip works a lot better than most people realize. Even running when streaming video, it does well.<br/><br/>3.) The display is adequate for business use. If you are a gamer or watching lots of video, it will likely be somewhat disappointing, good displays cost. You don't usually get something for nothing. Again, the display is adequate for what it is. Although the viewing angles are tight, I've seen other reviewers comments about the display and find their comments exaggerated and I wonder what they expect for a laptop that costs less than $500. Let me add that I have worked on a lot of PCs over the years, and I can tell you this display is good, but not great. However, if you want a premium display, like I said earlier, you need to pay for it. Again, this display is good enough for general use.<br/><br/>4.) The ports provided are the latest version of each type provided. Again, this laptop is a great value for the cost.<br/><br/>5.) The backlit keyboard is really good. I like the feel of the keys, and I like the numeric pad. The keyboard is quiet and comfortable to type on.<br/><br/>6.) The laptop's body/frame. Is plastic. Looks pretty darn good given the price of the unit. However, I am unsure as to how strong the body is should the laptop take a fall. I'm not doing a drop-test on this one because I have pay for it if I break it, but again, the price point of this laptop gives you a pretty darn good device for the price.<br/><br/>CONCLUSION: A surprisingly great laptop for the under $500 price charged and will be appreciated by a general or average user. (Suggestion: Keep the device in S Mode and save yourself malware and update headaches.)</span>
