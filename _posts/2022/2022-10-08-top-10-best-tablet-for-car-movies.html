<span>Definitely enjoyed this product especially for long road trips. The only issue we’ve have is it staying in position once tablet was in the holder(which ours was a bit heavy ish). Other then that great buy</span>

<p> </p>

<span>We bought this because we discovered that the double-sided versions all seem to be too small to fit between both headrests in our pickup truck, which is what we prefer to take on long road trips for travel comfort reasons. This model installed easily, held our tablet securely, and so far has been decent quality. The one downside is it gets a bit unstable and wobbly when extended out all the way. My kids didn’t care and it isn’t a deal breaker, especially since it’s probably unavoidable without attaching it all the way across, but it’s something other purchasers should know.</span>

<span>Needed to mount the iPad to keep the kids occupied on 2 road trips to visit family (1 was almost 12 hours). This was exactly as advertised. We set it up so the kids could watch cartoons in the backseat. We could flip it if we needed to access the iPad without hurting anything. It didn't even obscure the rear view. Highly recommend.</span>

<span>Is sturdy and secure in the cup holder in the back seat. Wanted it for my son to use in the back seat for his phone for long car rides, possibly to watch a movie etc. It did hold my son's phone securely (Moto Z). But had to return because the cupholder in the back seat of my car is too close to his face. So it would be nice if the long handle of the phone holder was flexible so that he could bend it further away, not so close to his face.</span>

Arkon’s TAB3-RSHM is a high-quality universal car seat headrest tablet mount that easily attaches to your car or truck’s headrest posts. This mount is compatible with 7 to 18.4 inches screen-size tablets with or without case. The headrest tablet mount is ideal for family road trips. The headrest tablet mount features an aluminum extension arm that positions the tablet between both front seats. The Slim-Grip® Universal Tablet Holder (Model #TAB001) is compatible with 7 to 18.4 inches screen-size tablets. The holder features a spring-loaded design that makes it easy to securely insert or remove the tablet by pushing down on the lower legs of the holder with one hand. The Headrest Car Seat Mounting Pedestal (Model #HM003-SBH) is a 2-post aluminum mount that can extend the arm between two seats. The headrest does not need to be a removable kind, just raise it up a few inches and the mount can attach to the round posts.

<span>I bought this brand based on owning the absolutely solid Akron desk/exercise bike tablet holder. Overall it's worked well. I'd give it 5 stars if not for a few minor flaws.<br/><br/>- I was worried about its strength due to its light weight, but its construction is solid. The pivot ball joint for the tablet holder could be a bit tighter, but for my 10.5" tablet (in a pretty thick case) it worked fine. It did not tilt down when we hit bumps.<br/><br/>- The attachment ball and holder is the same as on the Akron desk/exercise bike tablet holder. So if you've got one of those (or likely other Akron products), the holder portion is interchangeable. Since I got it for a 2 week road trip (when I wouldn't be using the exercise bike), I just move that holder to this mount. The holder this one shipped with is still in the plastic wrap as a spare.<br/><br/>Drawbacks:<br/><br/>- The biggest problem is that the attachment to the headrest posts could be more robust. The clamp has hinges and half of it moves down (or up depending on left or right headrest) to detach from the other half (see pics). You position it around the post, close the hinged portion of the clamp, then lower it so it catches on a lip on the other half. Tighten the thumbscrew (which are hex keyed if you want to use an Allen wrench) to keep it from sliding up/down on the post, and to keep tension on the lip to prevent it from slipping so the clamp stays locked. Well, this last part does not work so well. And the outermost clamp (which experiences greater up/down torques) slipped and came undone numerous times during a 2 week trip. Not often enough to be annoying (it's easy to reattach), but they really need a mechanism to lock it in its closed position. Maybe some detents in the lip so it stays put once mated and tensioned.<br/><br/>- You flip it over to attach it to the right headrest. I used it on the left headrest (kids were in left and center seats). The headrest post clamps may work better on the right (where they'll come down from the top to lock, instead of up from below to lock). When on the left, the latch to extend the post is on the bottom, which makes it a bit awkward to operate (but not impossible).<br/><br/>- When the extension post is fully retracted, the tablet will be at about the edge of the seat and partly in the middle. So there is no way to completely clear the middle aisle between the two front seats with this attached. You may wish to consider one of the Z-hinge designs if you need to clear the middle (though I don't know how robust that design is).</span>

<span>I can't say enough good things about this mount! It has saved mine and my wife's sanity on numerous long car trips, used periodically, for over two years, and it is still in like-new condition! Super easy and fast to install/un-install and solidly holds my iPad Air in place this mount has just been flawless. With two kids and one screen it is the perfect solution as it places the iPad evenly in between the rear seats where both kids can easily see. I cannot honestly imagine _not_ having this thing on a long car trip and the thought of it is the stuff of nightmares -- it is a must-have in my family now.<br/><br/>One point of fairness: other reviewers noted they had issues with the plastic tab that secures the backplate to the rest of the mount -- I agree this part of the mount looks and feels prone to breaking. Since I read these other reviews before I purchased mine, from Day 1, I have been very mindful of this when I install and un-install the mount and I believe this is why I haven't had any problems. Thanks to the other reviewers who suffered for my benefit. :)  For me the mount has held up perfectly well, and I am just a tad more careful when I attach the backplate. If it ever breaks on me I will come back and edit this review accordingly.</span>

<span>My Vehicle: 2006 Chevy Trailblazer<br/><br/>Original reason for purchase: 14 hours road trip from Long Island, NY to Indiana, Indianapolis with 5 adults, 1 toddler, and 1 infant.....needless to say we had very limited room.<br/><br/>Use: Backseat viewing for 21 month old son with iPad New (or iPad 3) and iPad Mini. Both worked well without the need for me to changed attachments....just had to rotate 90 degrees when using iPad mini. I never tried putting the iPad 3 in with the case BUT I did put the iPad Mini in with its case and it fit perfectly. The case I use is the Snugg.<br/><br/>Product Quality: after 10 days the knob at the end fell off. After 23 days one of the attachment pieces slid off its track and I never found it. I still use it because it can still hold my iPad Mini....I haven't tried with the iPad 3. It did come with other attachment sizes. Also,I have not had any rattling issues like I've read on other reviews. I just made sure it was secured correctly.<br/><br/>Bottom Line: it's ok but I don't know if I'd purchase this product again. When mount the iPad sits a little low which normally would be a problem but once my son realized he could reach the iPad by kicking he would continue kicking the screen just for the hell of it. I tried moving his car seat over to the left, the right and the center but never made a difference. Finally I placed his carseat (Britax Convertible Roundabout 55 and now in the Britax Pinnacle 90 Boaster) over to the passenger side back seats and I extend the arm of the mount all the way over to the driver side close to the driver's seat but without touching and he can't reach the iPad with his legs.<br/><br/>I'm thinking about getting the Gripdaddy because it mounts on the headrest which is higher than the mounting position of this one. I purchased this one with extendable arm because I'm pregnant with my second child and I was trying to this ahead about being able to place my iPad in the center for the both of them to watch.<br/><br/>I took one star off because of the knob falling off and then another star because of the attachment falling off and not staying firming in place in the track.</span>

<span>Nice tablet holder.  Has all metal joints and mounts to the seat bolt. Very sturdy. The arms are made of aluminium and I guess close to an inch in diameter. Easy to install. Easy to setup. Doesn't move at all with the motion of the car or on a bumpy road. A lot better and cheaper than RAM MOUNTS. Less bulky too. Has a lock that comes with 2 keys, and it securely holds your tablet. They ain't stealing this one. Also has a slot where you can attach a laptop lock and have a steel cable running from the back of the mount, to around the seat frame. Very well designed. I love it.

<span>I've tried several other brands of tablet mounts, but this is by far the best.  All metal construction gives me the security of knowing my tablet is safe.  Of course, if a thief wants it bad enough, I suppose they might be successful, but the point is, they will have to work at it for a while, increasing the chances of being seen.  It's a really good mount that is very secure and comes with many different brackets and mounting options that is bound to fit just about everyone's vehicle. This mount fits my Samsung Galaxy Tab A 10.1 2019 perfectly.  Tip-you might need a special Torx bit to remove your seat mounting bolts for this to attach to.  They are inexpensive, and are available at any auto parts store or right here on Amazon.</span>

<span>This thing is very elegant. The ball is about 20mm FYI.<br/><br/>I like the variety of arms you slide in and out of the mount. You can really get the size you want and even decide if you want to mount your tablet higher or lower inside mount.<br/><br/>I have a bunch of Arkon mounts and bases all over they're pretty durable.<br/><br/>Seems like they solved the broken base issue with this mount by adding a couple of extra screws. Well at least they're working on it, maybe it's better now.</span>

<span>This is a very well made holder, if you do not mind drilling into your dash to mount it.<br/>I have several friends that use this same holder in our service vans. O f which is the reason I bought it. Do not buy the cup holder types they fall apart and are flimsy. I bought one lasted a 1yr. I installed this in 10 minutes and working great. Would suggest to use lock tight on all screws, since the vibrations will cause it to come loose over time.</span>

<span>Mounted this in my truck to hold my tablet. Works great. Very sturdy, easy install, good looking. I read through some of the reviews, people talking about the plastic base breaking, I guess they changed the construction because mine didn't have any plastic except the actual holder, the pictures people posted look different than the type of connection point than what I got. Great product. One thing I would like to have is an even longer leg option. The case I have on my tablet has a hand strap on the back so it makes the tablet about an inch thicker, so the legs on the mount aren't holding it by much but are still working. I would recommend this product.</span>

<span>Really nice product out of the box. Fits beautifully on the head rest bars of the front seat and holds an Ipad Air 2 tightly. Nice adjustment angles too.<br/>Had to adjust the Allen screw at the back of the ball socket as it did become sloppy very quickly which was a pretty tricky job. Now that has been tightened it does a great job but this is something Kenu needs to look at. Hence the 3 star rating.<br/>*********Update.************<br/>Kenu contacted me after reading my first review, it seems I got an early model which was faulty. They sent me a new Airvue which has been perfect with no problems as previously reviewed. Great for the kids to watch movies on the Ipad on long car trips. A terrific simple solution which does exactly what it says perfectly!!<br/>Now definitely 5 stars!!</span>
