<span>The quality and clarity are great.  However, the behind the ear design does not set well when I wear my glasses which is most of the time.  If you look at the photos I submitted the BlueParrott does not set flat and kicks out at the bottom.  This put's pressure on the lower part of my ear and after extended wear causes some discomfort and tenderness. The second picture is another headset design that allows the behind the ear part to sit much flatter.<br/>I still like the BlueParrott and am willing to try it a bit longer to see if I can get used to it.  I did find the perfect hard case for it, GLCON Earbud case: https://www.amazon.com/dp/B083BM152Y?ref=ppx_yo2ov_dt_b_product_details&amp;th=1</span>

<span>Excellent audio quality and noise cancellation compared with other BT headsets on Amazon.  The only reason I'm not giving it 5 stars is, at this price, it should come with a hard shell case for protection.  I can easily see this headset getting damaged from tossing it in and out of my backpack, brief case and glove compartment.</span>

<span>I work from home. I use headsets for listening to music and taking support/meeting calls. After trying many other headsets I came across the BlueParrott S450-XT back in 2018. I will not own any other headset. I had one manager that was always complaining about my sound quality on the other headsets, but when I switched to the Parrot they didn't even know I was using a headset! I did by a backup pair just in case, it is that important to me, yet I am still using the original pair I bought in 2018 to this day, every day - 4 years later.  The headset always connects to my IPhone or PC and does so quickly. With the newer IPhones the range is fantastic. The audible battery charge state announcement is nice. My wish list: a larger power button and a larger over the ear pad option.</span>

<span>I have had several Bluetooth headphones earbuds etc. These are they only ones that have done what they are advertised to do. I have the b350-xt. If i could wear them all day I would if my job permitted it I'm around noisy pumps, water, and heavy equipment most days and they are very comfortable also when Im driving. Love the open ear deal all so. I'm still aware and can hear my surroundings.</span>

<span>It has a volume problem especially YouTube most of the time you barely hear the voice when your truck is on . This is supposed to be for truckers but the volume is set for office use where there is no noise. Truck engines makes noise therefore the volume has to be high . I have used other brands of Bluetooth the volumes are very high you use it as necessary as you want. This b 250 xts looks like the volume is controlled or set to factory standard or what I don't understand it. The noise cancellation is great . Sound quality great. Battery life great. Distance very good.</span>

<span>I bought this on behalf of my sister who has amazon prime but the password wasn't working on the computer she was on, so she had me order it and have shipped to her, I know, confusing,lol. The first one came quickly UPS. It was missing pieces, the ear hooks and different ear gels. Ordered used-like new from Bestdeals17 for $59.99, or about $30 less than new. She wanted to wear on the ear, so returned to vendor whom sent a printable UPS label. As soon as unit was received by UPS, vendor sent another unit. Received second one in a few days. This one was also missing pieces, however, this one came with installed ear piece and is working very well. I told her for $10 she can purchase a refresher kit that has 5 sizes of ear gels and 4 extra hooks, so that is what she will do. So all in all it's still $20 less than a new one, plus an extra ear gel, medium is the one that comes preinstalled per mfg. It sounds really great when she calls, and works good for her so far, she might try a different ear gel to get a better fit?? She's happy, I'm happy, other than being the middle man,lol, and customer service wasn't a problem.</span>

<span>I bought this hoping I could wear it working on and operating farm equipment.  It does work, But if you are in any wind at all your call quality to other person goes to near zero.  For operating equipment it is barely loud enough.  Battery will get you through one day but not two for sure.  Connectivity was a problem from day one for some reason and and lately the headset would not charge for me.<br/>I was trying to go away from larger headsets but in the end for what I’m doing it didn’t work for me. So I went back to the 450.<br/>Great headset for the office or In a car.  Not for working outside or operating equipment.</span>

<span>I purchased the headset for my spouse as a birthday gift back in April 2021. She's only had it about 1.5 months and she's already noticing the difference between this unit and her previous. I've had Blue Parrot headsets before as an owner operator they are synonymous with quality, but this unit does not match up in quality to their larger units. Being on the receiving end of the conversation I can hear all types of sound from rustling paper to wind. The headset does not cancel out noise as it should. My wife has also noticed that she can only get about 10 to 15 feet max distance at home, office or even outside before the unit has connection issues.  At this distance she receives garbled sound through her earpiece and if she is speaking we on the receiving end of the call cannot hear her. She will be calling warranty claims for help in this matter. We are very disappointed in this purchase especially considering the brands reputation and the price we paid.</span>

<span>I've had this headset for more than a year and a half at this point and it's still working great so it seemed like time to write a review for it.  I really never liked using BT earpieces in the past.  I'd purchased two or three over the years which reviewed well and were time-tested favorites but none of them worked well for me for one reason or another so while I really *needed* one again, I wasn't expecting a whole lot.  This earpiece however is the right one for me.  The fit is great and the battery life is better than I would have ever expected.  With as many recharge cycles as I've been through over the past 19 months, the full-charge battery life has dropped from 6 hours down to 5, but that's fair.  I use it a lot and I'm a little OCD about recharging things I can recharge so the decreased battery life isn't a concern for me in any way.  The fit of the headset was pretty decent out of the box, but I did ultimately go with an aftermarket kit to help dial the fit in a little better and I'm very happy that I did.  Noise cancelation on this thing appears to be at least satisfactory.  I've never had a complaint about ambient background noise which I expected to be the case, but I also get no complaints about wind noise, even in really lousy conditions.  I use it outdoors regularly (my work has me outside a LOT) and it's both tamed wind noise to the point where I've never heard a complaint, but it's also held up in light rain and snow.  I've never REALLY challenged it like in a hurricane or anything like that, but for the average person's noise concerns, expect no issues.  I did purchase the charging case with it as well.  I never used the decide without the charging case, so I can't really speak to how you'd do without buying it, but the case does a FANTASTIC job of keeping the battery topped off and does a great job of protecting the earpiece when it's in my backpack.  The only issue there is that I wish the case wasn't rubberized as it's a little difficult to get in and out of my pocket at times, but this review isn't about the case anyway - just letting you know.<br/><br/>Overall, this purchase has worked out really well and I hope that this model is still available if and when I need to replace the one I've got.  After all this time and all I've used it though, there's no room for any complaints!</span>

<span>Does well on both ends in noisy environment, battery life in use 4 to 5 hours. Can wear with a hard hat comfortably. Stays in ear pretty well with medium activity. Great for excavators, loaders,  cranes and rigging and while doing repairs. Hands free answering with caller identification (call from joe-answer or ignore).</span>

<span>Got this because I'd had issues with other headsets bad noise cancellation. The person on the other end couldn't hear me in noisier environments, especially if my voice wasn't as loud as the sounds around me.<br/>I was mostly interested in the boom mic because I figured that a microphone closer to my mouth would pick up sound better. But this headset goes far above and beyond. With the Voyager the other party often can't even hear sounds around me such as fans or air conditioners that used to make it impossible to talk, but they can still hear my voice with no problem.<br/>My only complaint is the battery life. I get a bit more than six hours, which is respectable, but with the larger size of this unit I was really hoping for a longer battery life. This means that I still need to keep my cheap Bluetooth around to listen to music and audiobooks, and then I switch to the Voyager when I start a call.<br/>Far from a deal breaker, but it would be nice if I could use one headset for the whole work day.<br/>I would also like to see the charging case included at a lower price point. The case is about $40-60 from Poly, but bundles with the headset and case seem to start at about $100 more than the headset alone. Hoping that this is due to supply chain issues and that people will stop gouging so much when things settle down again.<br/><br/>All in all, it's a great unit and I would definitely buy one again.</span>

<span>Still my favorite mono headset<br/><br/>Could use some updates, longer battery life, and better software for keeping a stable connection with iPhones and updated Bluetooth profiles such as allowing two to work in stereo.<br/><br/>Audio is a bit too low/quiet in some environments and getting is good fit inside the ear to keep it from moving can be hard.  Disconnects with iPhones even up through current models and iOS 15.x is still a problem.  Fights/argues with other Bluetooth devices about which device will connect and be primary.  Drops iPhone connections many times per day.  Standing against a wall or raising your arm over your head while talking and the other party will report dropped sounds or it can disconnect from the phone.  Especially as the phone rings or hangs up a call.</span>

<span> Never in my life have I ever wanted to get a massive headset.. but here I am! Finally joining the crew lol. I've had mainly little plantronic over the ear headsets but it was either they fell out my vest and I ran them over.. or I've had them for only a couple years before they started to act up.<br/>First off.. it fits my big head without the headset trying to squeeze your brains out.<br/>The muffs fit nicely over my ears and the padding is so cush omg it's nice.<br/>The detachable right side earmuff is cool but I prefer it attached.. easy to attach and reattach.<br/>Muffs are definitely adjustable.<br/>All operative buttons are on the left muff along with the mic.<br/>Mic pretty much sits in front of your mouth.<br/>Battery lasts for a very long time which is so wonderful.<br/>Noise cancellation is good, I have no complaints hearing calls or even music through this headset in our Lonestar.<br/>Uses a micro usb to charge.<br/>Only complaint.. I can't eat while the mic is completely down lol it does get in the way.<br/>Other than that I urge you to give it a go!!</span>

<span>Mic works great even in really noisy environments, and still remains audible even next to a running diesel engine, speakers are loud and you can listen to music but not really get lost in the sound, the anc mode is actually quite good and though it filters out the background noise it still allows you to hear the road, the removable side however has fallen off several times already when I kept it on my neck cuz the release button got pressed in, it is super comfortable to keep on ears for extended periods of time, good buy all in all.</span>

<span>I'm not a trucker, but I needed a solidly comfortable, noise-canceling headset for work &amp; traveling. I've only had it a week, so I'll update this if anything changes.<br/><br/>I work from home but occasionally take calls in noisy airports. In an airport, you never know when someone will call overhead, so the booming noises are hit and miss. That can be highly disruptive during a conference call. One day I thought, what do truckers use? They're in constant nosy environments, and I'm sure there's a headset with them in mind.<br/><br/>That led me to try Blue Parrot. I tried two different versions, the 250 &amp; 450 (had one to travel and one for home). Both were great with battery life and noise-canceling, but after a few hours of use, both hurt my ear. They're on-the-ear headsets, and no matter what I did, I couldn't get them adjusted to where I could use them for long periods. That search led me to this headset- an over-the-ear headset with the option to cover both ears or just one.<br/><br/>I bought it.<br/><br/>It arrived with a semi-hard carrying case which I like. You can keep up with the extra pieces and charging cord. Plus, it makes it easy to store/travel with. It arrived partially charged, so I had to try it out. I paired it with my phone and made a call. It paired quickly, just like most any Bluetooth headset. I made several calls to clients intentionally speaking low and not one complaint. Trust me - clients will let you know if they have issues hearing you.<br/><br/>Using both over-the-ear pieces, I could make calls with it all day without any noise concerns. Using one over-the-ear piece, I can do the same thing, but the over-the-head piece does dig into your head a little. I found myself having to readjust it. I also noticed the weight is shifted slightly, and I think that's why it digs into my head. It's not painful but noted.<br/><br/>I used it going through the airport- not one single complaint. I intentionally spoke with clients in the airport to elicit a response- not one complaint.<br/><br/>From a noise-canceling standpoint- it's outstanding.<br/><br/>Here are a few things that aren't exactly a negative but need some work- the on/off &amp; volume buttons aren't intuitive and aren't easy to find while on a call. They should be more pronounced, IMO. Mute - is very simple - simply raise the mic up. It works but makes me nervous. I appreciated the Blue Parrot’s periodic beep to confirm it's on mute. Again the mute works, but I would love a beep or something to prove it's on mute—nothing worse than thinking you’re on mute during a client call.<br/><br/>Again, not a trucker, but I need excellent noise canceling and a comfortable headset - this works.<br/><br/>6/8/2022 - 1st update- riding a bus in New York City, I got in a conference call using the headset. I let them know where I was, and they were amazed- they could not hear the crowd noise or music playing.  Win-win.<br/><br/>7/14 2nd update -- had a problem with the charging of the headset. I contacted Customer support - they agreed to swap it out. In fact, there wasn't an argument or anything - I said there's a problem and they said that's not a problem we'll exchange it. No fuss, no muss, makes me wonder if they have a known issue -- and aren't telling us. Here's the kicker - before they'll ship me a new headset I had to send them mine. They said expect a 7-14 day turn around. No kidding.<br/><br/>Using the side piece (not the over the earpiece), my head starts to hurt after an hour or so. I can adjust it and get some relief. The headpiece would work better if that bar were wider.<br/><br/>Update 9/6/2022: The off and on button continues to be awkward for home office use. Have fell in love with the mute option.</span>

<span>I compared both these and the blue parrot 650 by leaving them on my head for hours on a while driving and the Garmin ones are leaps and bounds way more comfortable. Both are great at blocking out background noise when speaking on the phone. The Garmin noise-canceling though is a joke. Also there's this annoying thing that every time I turn it on or off it also turns off my Garmin dezl Navigator I don't know why and sometimes it does this after phone calls too. For $400 😐 come on Garmin. Might return these if I can find some that fit more comfortably than Blue Parrot and can block out most noise.</span>

<blockquote><em><div class="a-row a-spacing-small review-data"><span class="a-size-base review-text review-text-content" data-hook="review-body">
<span>I have had this bluetooth headset for about 3 weeks now, and I am very satisfied. I am slightly unimpressed with the incoming sound quality, and the fit (not necessarily the fault of the device, I'll explain below), but overall I really like this headset. This is the third bluetooth headset I have owned and it is by far the best quality headset (and most expensive). In this case, it was definitely worth paying extra for quality.<br/><br/>I really enjoy have the freedom this headset provides. Not only does is provide hands-free calling, Plantronics takes the value of this a step or two farther than an average, budget headset.<br/><br/>The headset's build quality is the best I've owned thus far between my 3 headsets, as it should be given the price comparison. It is hard plastic and rubber (I think). The hard materials provide this headset with what appears to be excellent durability (time will tell, but I have no concerns). The headset is still plenty flexible enough to adjust to different sized ears. The earpiece and microphone boom swivel easily to allow for changing ears. I'm weird and only like wearing headsets on my right ear, however I've worn this headset a few times on my left ear and have forgotten I was wearing it, it's very comfortable.<br/><br/>As far as the actual fit of the headset, it is generally good. I've heard nothing but raving reviews from friends who have the headset about its overall quality, especially its fit/feel/comfort. For me personally, it is VERY comfortable, but does not fit well. That might sound odd, but it's true. Because the ear piece is flexible, it will make fitting normal sized ears to very large ears very easy. However, being a fixed size (not physically adjustable) makes it difficult for me because I have smaller than average ears. Once I get the headset in a good spot, it is very comfortable, but sometimes it takes me a few tries to really get it in a comfortable, secure position. Again, not necessarily the fault of the product, but I do wish there was something they could have done to accommodate people with smaller ears. Having said that, I still enjoy the headset, it's just not the perfect fit I half expected from all the fantastic reviews I've heard and read. I did not take off any stars for this matter. This headset is easy to leave on for LONG periods of time. I haven't had to yet, but I literally believe I could go all day with this in my ear and hardly be bothered at all.<br/><br/>Sound quality. This is where I docked the product a star (the only star). Because of reviews I've read and personal accounts from friends, I expected near flawless audio incoming and outgoing through this device. It's good, don't get me wrong, but not excellent. The INCOMING phone call audio from other callers, seems to generally be a little more hollow with a metallic echo (that's the best way I can describe it). I can still hear the person I'm talking to without an issue, but there is a clear difference from my phone to the headset. I especially notice it if I switch mid-call. As for the outgoing call quality, I have asked numerous callers how I sound and if I sound okay on the phone and they all say I sound good (most with an odd tone of voice, like they had no idea I was on a headset). What really sold me on the outgoing sound quality was a phone call with my brother. He is huge into technology and tends to be very picky (as I am) with the quality of his technology. While on a call with him, I started on my phone and switched to my headset mid-call. After talking for another few minutes I asked him how I sounded. He said "absolutely fine, why?" He was surprised when I told him I switched mid-call to my headset. He said he honestly couldn't tell the difference. He never would have known I switched if I hadn't told him.<br/><br/>I believe those are the main points most people would be interested in hearing about in a headset. Below is a quick list of pro's and con's in my experience with the headset thus far:<br/><br/>Pro's:<br/>- Outgoing call quality<br/>- Build quality<br/>- General feel/comfort of the headset<br/>- Good battery life (improved charging convenience if you buy the matching charging case)<br/>- Ability to voice-dial nearly any contact on my phone, without having to touch my phone<br/>- Ability to enter pair mode, as well has check batter status/talk time, and the current connected device all by voice (among a few other things)<br/>- Quick-mute button (without having to touch your phone) - VERY convenient when I'm on conference calls for my business in the car and don't want to trouble the rest of the group with road noise.<br/>- Having the volume rocker and power on/off switches physically on the back of the device<br/>- Super-easy pairing to mobile devices<br/><br/>Con's:<br/>- Not a perfect fit (but definitely manageable) for people with smaller ears<br/>- Incoming call quality noticeably more hollow with a metallic echo compared to traditional phone call quality, but certainly not to the point of trouble understanding someone. I am still able to understand them fine, I might just be more picky than some.<br/><br/>Overall feelings:<br/>- A great quality product with VERY FEW drawbacks (mostly personal to me), makes the Plantronics Voyager Legend the best headset I've ever owned and would easily recommend to anyone looking for a quality headset.</span>

<span>This headset is not perfectly perfect in every way but it is the best that you can buy.<br/><br/>This is the only headset in the Plantronics lineup listed as having "premium" quality sound. It is Plantronics' flagship headset. Plantronics is the industry leader in earpiece headsets. If you are looking for the highest-quality headset you can buy, look no more. You have come to the right page.<br/><br/>The primary complaint I've read about on the Plantronics customer service site is that after two years the battery will die a natural death due to old age. So do realize that this will not last forever. If your battery dies while the headset is under warranty, that's too soon and Plantronics will replace it. If your battery dies in less than 2 years but out of warranty, Plantronics is currently offering customers substantial discounts to buy replacements. (Save your receipt! Scan it if you're paperless. Or buy it from Amazon where they will keep a record for you.)<br/><br/>I just bought my second one - the first lasted about 4 years for me with light use. I did read that some can get extra life out of their battery by putting the headset into a ziploc and then into the freezer overnight... so if you're here for a replacement, you might try that first and buy a little more time. I got a few extra months out of mine by discarding the (optional accessory) case I was using to charge it and by charging it directly through the OEM cord that came with it (so save that too!).<br/><br/>WHAT YOU GET:<br/>Packaging is Easy to Open: there is a large sticker sealing the opening to the smallish box closed. That is easily cut with a pair of scissors. Then pull out the cardboard wings that are tucked into slots on each side of the front of the box and open it up.<br/>- Plantronics headset (battery is permanently installed)<br/>- Proprietary charging cord with separate wall plug<br/>- Two additional ear plugs -- larger and smaller than the one preinstalled on the headset<br/>- Foam covers for the ear plugs, to use or not as you prefer<br/>- Instruction Booklet<br/>- Instructions on Firmware Update<br/>- Safety Warnings<br/>- Some stuff in another language<br/><br/>The cord is USB on the wall end and proprietary on the headset end (only matches the headset). That means that you can plug the cord into the computer to get firmware and software updates from Plantronics (which is the first thing that they recommend you do upon unpackaging your headset). The cord is short, just under 10" long (without the connectors).<br/><br/>It's easy to change the ear plugs in and out so that you can try different sizes. You just press in and turn to the left. To insert one, you press in and turn to the right. (All of this is in the instruction book.) I found that I could use the small or the medium. I'm a 5'7" woman who weighs more than she should but you wouldn't hate sitting next to me on a plane. The ear plug sits loosely just inside your ear. You may not even feel it. It's definitely not a snug fit and you will hear surrounding sounds in both ears. What keeps the headset in place is the rest of it, not the ear plug.<br/><br/>The boom mic is adjustable. I found it was directly pointed toward my mouth in it's lowest position.<br/><br/>The device has a call button on the round part, from which the boom extends. That's for taking and ending calls if you don't want to use voice commands, which also work. On the underside of the boom is another button that mutes calls among other things. There is a volume rocker on the upper back part of the largest part of the device -- the part that goes behind the ear. And below that is the on/off switch. At the bottom of the back is the charging connector -- just a bit of recessed coppery looking metal.<br/><br/>It reads "Plantronics" in very subtle small pale gray lettering at the bottom of the largest part of the device, on both sides. You can see where it is in the small shiny black part at the bottom of the picture.<br/><br/>If you have the right expectations (it's not a magic genie... It may only last for two years... A very few of them will be defective and will require replacement...), you will be delighted with your purchase. You will not find better sound quality anywhere else. If you are used to music headphones, the looser, more open feel of the headset in your ear (or barely touching the front of your ear), might take some adjustment.<br/><br/>I highly recommend this product and am confident that, if after reading this review you still want it, you will not be disappointed.<br/><br/>UPDATE: One feature I have come to really appreciate is the voice commands. Some parts of my house get spotty cell phone reception. So, when I'm wearing the headset (during work hours), I always leave my phone in a "good reception area" of the house. If a call comes in, I don't have to rush back to the headset to pick it up, I just say, "answer" and the headset picks up the call. If the caller is in my address book, the phone will announce who's calling. If I'm silent or say "decline," the call is not picked up.</span>

<span>Great battery life,  close to 7 hours.  they last about a year for me but I  use them daily.  Heavy usage,  and all day long.  Usually the area that flexes gets stretched apart and becomes loose on your ear over time, and around which time they start losing the ability they have that senses if it is actually on your ear. Then, it starts intermittently disconnecting from calls or audio.  I turn that option off in the app and then it works ok again. But you do lose some functions,  such as seamless hot swapping among other bluetooth accessories. But there is not much better out there that compares.<br/><br/>The twist on ear "gel" is likely the biggest weakness,  they get broken in a pocket if you aren't careful.  Amazon has off brand replacements for 6-8 bucks and they are ok.<br/><br/>Killed one getting it wet in a light rainstorm once, so water is not great for these it seems.  Wasn't that wet either. I forgot it was on,  so that tells you how comfortable they are.<br/><br/>I've bought quite a few and keep buying them, so they must be ok for the money.  I came from Jawbone Icon etc and miss those terribly but these keeps me pretty happy . When they hit $60,  they're definitely a buy it now. The price fluctuates a bit but not sure we'll see that again,  they seem to be in the $80+ range now.  I'm still buying them nonetheless.</span>

<span>I have had many blur tooth headsets, but this one is in my opinion the best yet. It's very light weight, very flexible. Doesn't go in your ears,so you can actually hear what's going on around you while wearing it.<br/>A couple of cons (at least for me anyway) is where the volume, on &amp; off buttons are,I feel they are in a bad spot and to small and should be on the outside vs on the bottom., I feel the rage could be longer,I am a truck driver &amp; if I need to go back to the end of the trailer, I need to make sure and take my phone with me or it will disconnect, but overall I am Impressed and completely satisfied.<br/>One thing I forgot to mention  is when listening to music, you better remember to turn the volume down before turning a song on because the speakers are su powerful for something so small, they will blow your eardrums out of your head. The sound is amazing for speakers as small as they are.<br/>They are so light weight, I literally forget I'm wearing them</span>

<span>This device works well as as telephone headset and to listen to podcasts or other spoken-word media. Setup was easy and worked the first time. My only disappointment was that music playback did not sound very good- mostly lacking in bass response, but a bit of a muddy quality in the rest of the audio spectrum. One problem I had was that to mute the microphone one must press both the volume down and volume up buttons simultaneously, something that’s difficult to do while wearing the headset. Coincidentally, to turn the headset off or on one must press the volume up button by itself. This often resulted in my turning the headset off when attempting to mute the microphone. Very annoying and somewhat difficult to recover from.<br/><br/>Otherwise I thought that the headset was a good product. Comfortable to wear and providing long battery life.</span>

<span>I don't usually write reviews, but this headset is one of the best I've ever used for home office or on the road.<br/>Pros:<br/>I've always felt that the bone conduction heads sets would be uncomfortable, but these are very comfortable.  I've been able to use them for conference calls that last for hours.  I also like the ability to hear what is going on around me and don't feel so isolated as I would wearing standard over the ear headphones.  The sound is excellent.  But what has sold me is the microphone.  It does not pick up any of the surrounding noise.  There has been noise that I can hear from another room but people on the calls could not hear it.<br/><br/>Cons:<br/>One thing that I do not like or find difficult to get used to is the fact that the volume and mute controls do not work unless you are on a phone call or playing music.  If you are using it through Windows and are on Teams, Zoom, OfficeHD, the volume and microphone adjustments have to be made from the application.  This a bit limiting when using those applications as it keeps you from walking around while on the call if you are muted or need to mute or unmute.  If AfterShokz could fix that feature, I would give it 5 stars.<br/><br/>Recommendation:<br/>I would recommend purchasing this headset if you need an office headset or if you are on the road a lot.</span>

<span>Short version: improved audio, improved comfort, improved multi-pairing (not perfect multi-pairing but improved)<br/><br/>Long version:<br/>I have never liked the feel of headset on top of my head or earbuds in my ear or those noise-cancelling suction cups over my ears.  For ages, there was a cheap behind-the-neck headset with lightweight speakers and I used nothing else, but they were finally discontinued, and the only behind-the-neck headsets I could find were blue-tooth.<br/><br/>I bought a cheap bluetooth but wasnt happy with its connection to my PC (I still use it with my phone, tho).  I tried the Titanium and it had a slightly better connection to my PC.  I was also able to connect it to both my home pc and my work laptop (i have 2 desks in an L shape) - but sometimes I had to manually disconnect under the blue-tooth setting from one and reconnect to the other and overall the connection was often poor or static-y.<br/><br/>My titanium's arm broke after 10 months of wear.  I still couldnt find anything I liked better - plus since I was being discontinued, the price had dropped from about 120 to 80.  I bought another - and it performed about the same, and also broke at 10 months.<br/><br/>I'd seen the openComm and figured that maybe the 'loop' connector would help me in teams meetings, where I was often told I was going in and out.  It took me a day (a day fiddling with the tape holding my titanium together!) to muster up the willpower to pay $200 for a tiny little headset, but I did.<br/><br/>It arrived friday evening, so I used it all weekend (I was in the middle of binging a show!) - I was immediately impressed with how much lighter it was than the titanium and how much better the sound quality was!  These really are noticeably more comfortable for long wear than the titanium were.<br/><br/>Monday of course was the test - plugging in to my work laptop.  I actually plugged the dongle into my 'docking station' before I even turned on the power, and sure enough, when i opened bluetooth settings, the opencomm was already connected.<br/><br/>However . .. it wasnt actually working.  I tried a few things - powering off, turning blue tooth on and off on each PC . . . but eventually i found the instructions!  I had my previous review deleted for including the link, but you can find it . . .search for Shokz multipoint pairing, and the first result should be from shokz help section.  apparently there's another button combination you have to push to activate multipoint pairing.  Only comment is that it does work to turn off bluetooth (under bluetooth settings) instead of unplugging the dongle if you prefer that.<br/><br/>so now . . well, my PC's bluetooth is unreliable so i sometimes have to turn blue tooth off for a minute, and sometimes i actually have to reboot just to get my bluetooth working again, but on the work side, I've had no trouble.  Well, I have had people complain they cant hear me . . . if I forget to move the mic up to the front of my face!  But thats it.  And since my husband and I work in the same room and often have meetings at the same time, the noise cancelling is great!  With the titanium, i did get complaints about my husband in the background occasionally.<br/><br/>So overall I'm pleased.  This is definitely an improvement over the titanium, and especially if you are using it for work meetings.  The only reason its 4 instead of 5 stars is that I am still uncomfortable paying that much for a headset<br/><br/>PS - I forgot to say how much better the charger is, too!  Titanium's mini-usb was unusually hard to get plugged in.  The magnetic charger for these OpenCom is not only easy to attach, but a strong enough magnet that it stays pretty securely.  It also does seem to hold a charge longer than the Titanium did.</span>

<span>I use this for working by phone w/clients; for music on my bike or out for walks/hikes.<br/><br/>I originally bought it because I’ve had recurring ear infections, the last one so bad, ear buds of any variety were out of the question.<br/><br/>But these have been absolutely wonderful! They get so comfortable I forget I have them on, (though I am glad to remove them). They work in traffic, and provide great sound for voice, and very decent for music. I switch them easily between two phones no hassle. And they never run out of charge-they fast charge up in minutes. I have never run out  of battery on them with just a bit of awareness to charge them up between uses.<br/><br/>The one thing I have noticed is they need a little switching time to turn on for my first call; they require a drop down menu selection usually even when the headset is already connected, which creates a little bit of an unnatural lag in connecting to the caller. But people get used to it.<br/><br/>One more thing I should add, is if they aren’t sitting just right to the head, sometimes they’ll vibrate a bit-I find this is a simple adjustment of their position on my head. While I’m pretty sensitive, and it’s fine for me, some users may need to consider this when purchasing.<br/><br/>I love this headset!!</span>

<span>I drive CDL and run excavating equipment and (surprise) I have hearing loss. My Open Comm headset works in just about all background noise situations, even wearing ear plugs.  The noise cancelling microphone works great.  And they can stay on all day comfortably.  If you are looking for something to wear exercising they do a great job of staying put.  The only thing you may find disappointing is the sound quality of music (if you are an audiophile) For me I'd say they are the best trucker's Bluetooth headset you can buy...and they look better too.</span>

<span>This headset is remarkable. It is fairly comfortable for all day wear, although it feels good to take it off. I use it when responding to fire and medical calls and it allows me to hear private radio transmissions and phone calls. I can't believe it has survived the abuse it gets (including being run over by a car). I lost one and had to shell out for a replacement so a lower cost would make me happy. I can't live without it.</span>

<span>As background, I have tried numerous bluetooth headsets - some with noise cancellation and some without - to try to be intelligible in my convertible sports car - with the top up, of course.  Some were workable for most people, but my elderly dad with hearing aids often could not hear me when I was on a freeway or driving in traffic.<br/><br/>So I tried this Shokz unit since it has a noise cancellation microphone on a boom so it would be nearer my mouth and, voila!, it worked!  Dad has not had a problem hearing me and even cannot tell whether I am driving or sitting on the couch at home.  So, from a standpoint of whether this is great for communication purposes, it is by far the best I have ever tried.<br/><br/>***** Update: 9/30 - Even better!  I called my wife with the top down, at 70mph on the freeway and with the side windows up she could tell but still hear me fine.  With the windows down there was definitely more noise but we could still carry on a normal conversation without raising my voice!  And I can confirm that with Houston traffic at 70 mph all around, it was noisy!<br/>***** End update - back to original review<br/><br/>So why 4 stars?  Many people buy headsets for music and the bone conduction, while great for voice and podcasts, is not nearly as good for listening to music.  The bass level is weaker than most and it simply is not nearly as true musically.  But, again, I did not buy it for this and have other options if that is what I want.<br/><br/>The second reason is the charging cable.  It works great - it is a magnetic unit similar to what is common on smart watches but just much smaller.  But I wish that it was a micro-USB or USB-C which it could have been, because if it gets misplaced or is lost at some point, there is no other alternative that will work.  Like most, I have tons of USB cables that have filled drawers around the house, so I can find a cable that will work for anything that needs USB connection.  But lose this cord and hope Shokz will overnight it to you or within a day you will have a nice piece of unusable tech!  (Since I charge mine in my car and the cable is attached to a USB outlet, I should be fine until I take a trip somewhere and misplace it!)</span>

<span>I literally use it everyday. I hate holding my phone to my face and I like to keep one ear open for awareness, so this is perfect for me.<br/><br/>Battery life is nice and the extra battery is an amazing touch. Sounds is good for talking as well</span>

<span>I can walk away from my phone 30+ feet and not drop a call or lose my tunes.  I do find however that when my phone is in my back pocket, I lose connection nearly every time.  I can leave my phone on my desk and go outside my shop and still stay connected through metal walls, not sure why my back pocket puts a strain on it.  My headset came with 2 batteries, and I find a full charge easily lasts a full day on 1 battery, playing music all day.</span>

<span>Sound is loud. This is the first ear device I've purchased that I actually had to turn the volume down while I use it. I work with heavy equipment and semi trucks in noisy environments and have no problem hearing calls nor do people hear any background noise. I bought a Blue Parrott ear piece at the same time and I will be returning it tomorrow. I've owned 3 Plantronics devices over 8yrs at $100 dollars or more, and have always had problems with magnetic charging staying attached, and battery life. (Had to charge 2 or 3 times a week)<br/>On receiving this device I charged both batteries included in the box, started using it on Monday and now on Thursday after 10 - 12hr days I have only use the one battery and it still has 40% left on it.<br/>The fit and confort is perfect, it stays secure on and in the ear.<br/>My only complaint would be the easy of answering and hanging up calls, the double tap will take some getting use to, also there is no volume control on the device, you control that on your phone. Also unlike Plantronics this does not announce whos calling. No big deal I can look at my phone or watch to see the caller.<br/>Other than that, for the price I'm keeping it. If it fails to work I'll revise this. But so far I'm impressed.</span>
