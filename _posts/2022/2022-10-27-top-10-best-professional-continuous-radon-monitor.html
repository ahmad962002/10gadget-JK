<span>App to use this was easy to install and while a little limited it works well. I see a big difference in a closed off after I crack a window. The front LED indicates low, medium, and high levels so you don't need to look at the app all the time. I just wish the app had more features. Great for a home unit. You can move around to different parts of the house to check levels, but I didn't see a way to reset the data when you do that. It does what I wanted.</span>

<span>I found that EcoQube has been publicly announced as recipient of CES 2021 Innovations award honoree on the CES website and had started to get interested in this product.  (* CES: the most influential tech event in the world)<br/><br/>I purchased a new home on 12/01/2020 and the radon level came back at 5.9 pCi/L in the basement during a building inspection. I thought, maybe I had better get my place tested. I did some research, and was put off with the idea of paying $5 to $10 for a kit, having to do the test over a period of time then having to pay and wait for each result. We had decided to buy some radon detectors to retest when the new home was mine to double check. EcoQube e is not our first radon detector, we have gone through a few other brands(Airthings, etc) to get accurate radon data for my house.<br/><br/>The high radon levels were 2.3 pCi/L in the basement, 1.2 pCi/L on first floor, and 0.5 pCi/L on second floor after a 7 day test on both levels. It's now been set up for one month, and the readings have been consistent with what my inspector told me. This testing via EcoQube saved us a ton of money on installing a radon mitigation system and it's not inexpensive product but over the long run will prove worthwhile I believe.<br/><br/>EcoQube stands out because it seems to provide the most accurate and stable readings when compared to the other brands we purchased. This's actually real time radon detector for home owner which has the high sensitivity - 0.5cpm/pCi/l (13.5cpm/1000Bq/m3) and 30cph/pCi/l, about 20~30 times more than conventional radon detector by high stable circuit technology. I think you should check accuracy and sensitivity information when trying to order a radon detector. With my research and investigation for multiple consumer radon detectors, EcoQube is the best product than any other products based on testing results with high accuracy data. (our professional inspector agreed that too after comparing to their short and long team inspection result)<br/><br/>Mobile App was incredibly easy to set up and working well via Wi-Fi connection in both iOS(iPhone11) and Android(Samsung Galaxy S20). Find an area you want to test, plug the device in, make sure the air holes aren't blocked, and wait. you can leave it on a flat surface like a counter, tile, or carpet. It's very straightforward to check LED color and to switch between long- and short-term readings. To me, it was pretty impressed that it provides the first reading in 10 minutes after plug &amp; play setup, reliable result within 1 hour.<br/><br/>If you're looking for BEST Accurate Radon Detector, I do recommend the EcoQube to families with kids, property managers renting out homes, or anyone else who wants an alarm built into their continuously monitored radon detector. Again, I'm happy to see this product became 'CES 2021 Innovation Awards'!</span>

We spend 90% of our time indoors where the air is often 2 to 5 times worse than the air outside. Continuous monitoring of indoor air quality is key for minimizing negative health effects, preventing illness and increasing productivity, energy and good health. Airthings, air quality specialists and experts in radon, created the Airthings Wave Plus as the first smart air quality monitor with radon detection. Wave Plus has since won multiple awards for consumer electronics and innovation and was among the 2019 TIME Magazine inventions of the year. It is the perfect solution for homeowners to gain full visibility into six indoor air factors; radon, carbon dioxide (CO2), airborne chemicals (TVOCs), humidity, temperature and air pressure. Airthings Wave Plus includes a free app to connect to your smartphone (iOS/Android) via Bluetooth and an online dashboard with advanced analytics. Battery operated allowing you to install anywhere, with 16 months battery life. Please allow for a 7-Day settling period for the sensors to adjust to their new environment. By monitoring daily and continuously, you can avoid radon side effects, get the best indoor humidity level, low voc levels and low carbon dioxide levels. Made to the best indoor air quality standards, Airthings Wave Plus is essential in every home.

<span>I can't say too much about accuracy as I haven't had a good way to test them, but I can say that I've been living with these sensors for a while now, and they do quite reliably respond to environmental events. I can turn on a fan, for example, and see PM2.5 trend higher as dust is kicked up, or I can sit in an unventilated office and watch the CO2 climb. So I have every reason to trust the sensor.<br/><br/>My deeper experience is with using these sensors with IFTTT automation, as well as the dashboard and API.<br/><br/>The dashboard and app are pretty good. My biggest gripe would be that they're a bit static. So you'll get the data in the structure they want you to, but there's not a lot of flexibility. For example, thresholds (even for push notifications) aren't customizable. But it all works and shows me plenty of information, so I'm happy.<br/><br/>But if things like threshold flexibility bother you, support for IFTTT yields all the flexibility you need.<br/>IFTTT gives exactly what we could expect: connect accounts, and you can trigger based on thresholds for each metric on a given device. It triggers reliably, and IFTTT gives such a wide array of actions to take, so that's great.<br/><br/>And  if you're even "beyond" IFTTT, the offered API (or file downloads) lets you pull data into whatever reporting platform you want. I pipe all of my readings into Elasticsearch, personally.<br/><br/>I also applaud the app, website, IFTTT integration, and API for being able to support an arbitrarily large collection of all the sensors they make. I've seen products like this in the past that are really only built for a user to have a single device, and that can be a frustrating limitation. But that's no issue here, and I think it's partially a result of their b2b offering, which provides some extra functionality (like a webhook platform, I believe) for workplace deployments. Those deployments would have potentially dozens of devices, and that support reflects in the design.<br/><br/>Overall, I'd readily recommend them.</span>

<span>So, I got concerned with Radon and wanted something that would continually test the air in my basement. After looking some, I found this and it looked pretty reasonable for the price.<br/><br/>As far as I know, it is accurate in all the measurements (I have nothing else to compare it to, so I am trusting it).<br/><br/>The only issue I really have is the rating system. It will notify you (or, if you look at the dashboard) that something is high, which is good, but, it gives you a color rating that really doesn't have definition behind it. For instance, the temp in my basement shows 76F and dark orange ish, but, when it hits 64F, it goes green. The total air quality does something similar where it will be a light orange, but it really doesn't give you any definition as to why. So, just kind of an annoyance more than anything.</span>

<span>I moved into a new home in western North  Carolina and wanted to measure the effects of living in the mountains on the air I and my family breathes. Knowing that radon is a factor as well as particulates and VOCs, I decided to give Air Things a try. The testing of the device was perfectly timed as being a new home for us, we were adding in radon mitigation in the crawlspace and I could perform a before and after test not only seeing if the mitigation worked on the radon, but if the Air Things View measured a difference.<br/><br/>On the radon measurements I saw a significant drop in radon in the living space as measured (and expected) the day after the mitigation system was installed going from an average of 3 pCi/L to less then 1 pCi/L. The Air Things View saw a drop which gave me the confidence that it was measuring accurately.<br/><br/>As a second test, I ran the unvented propane fireplace directly under the Air Things for the first time and checked the measurements during the fireplaces use. A drastic increase in VOCs as well as CO2 was noted. I expected some increase here given the burning of the propane in the fireplace but I was surprised at the level of emissions!<br/><br/>If you view the attached pictures you can see the location of my Air Things View above the fireplace and the two charts showing the drop of radon after the mitigation system went active as well as the spikes in CO2 and VOCs during the 15 minutes the fireplace was running.<br/><br/>I am more impressed by the Air Things View performance than I expected to be. Having the opportunity to observe it through its calibration period while seeing it react to the radon and propane fireplace tests was a real boost that my purchase was well worth the investment.</span>

<span>Bought this unit to test overall air quality and realized we had a radon problem.  Wasn't even looking for that, so I am grateful it was included.  Here's the problem though... while it IS somewhat in the ballpark for the radon level, we discovered it erred on the low side after testing it alongside 3 other detectors - 2 similar type monitors of a different brand and 1 traditional charcoal test that we sent to a lab.  Local radon mitigation companies trust the charcoal tests, they don't trust these monitors and told us to make sure we did the charcoal test too.  Glad we did.<br/><br/>Here's the thing... radon is a fluctuating number.  After copious amounts of radon research along with my test results, I learned quite a bit.  This monitor tells you that you must let it "calibrate" for 7 days to get a reading that is somewhat accurate and that 30 days is best.  You really end up evaluating an average when understanding where your radon level is, but it doesn't feel good to see high spikes that get averaged out with lower ones.  I like seeing where the top numbers land and how often. The app and information given is really nice and well delivered.<br/><br/>In the first 7 days, our numbers for all metrics would wildly fluctuate.  This particular monitor is not measuring with a high number of data points.  I learned that quick and accurate radon testing requires a lot of data points.  There are other monitors out there that do this much better because they have more data points (we tested alongside RadonEye that matched our charcoal test sent to a lab).  The Airthings average level was lower by over 1 full point (the monitor was right beside the charcoal test).  In radon terms, that too much difference (1 point is significant) to be considered an accurate monitor for me.  But it WAS consistent after that first 7 days with its own measurements, going up and down consistently (higher at night, higher when it rains - all things you learn about radon when researching that proved true for us).  But those averages were still lower than the other tests that also had consistency and, most importantly, matched each other.  Airthings was the odd man out with the lower reading. And it takes this monitor a while to adjust to change (about 24 hours at least) while the other monitors give you accurate readings much more quickly (within a couple of hours) if you move it to a different room.<br/><br/>Radon aside, I feel like the other metrics of VOCs, CO2, etc are probably pretty good.  I didn't test those against another machine so I can't say for sure.  But they did respond to change like fresh air coming in to the room, etc.  Those metrics change more in real time which is nice to see.<br/><br/>Overall, I love the look of the monitor, it's easy to place with not needing to be plugged in, the app is very easy to use and delivers the information beautifully.  It only lacks in accuracy for radon in my experience.  If that got better, I would choose this monitor over the others hands down.  They are the same price for only radon testing and they need to be plugged in.<br/><br/>I will be returning this one because I want radon accuracy but if I wanted the other metrics, I'd get this one without hesitation.</span>

<span>I am a retired chemist so I’m concerned about radon emissions. I had absolutely no knowledge of this product or company until I found out that have a lot of radon in my new home. So, I purchased a model 223 a couple weeks ago and am using it to help me understand the situation while I wait for remediation. It’s doing a wonderful job of informing me of ‘hot spots’ and the average level throughout the house while I hold my breath.<br/><br/>Now to its accuracy. The Corentium 223 specification is perhaps the most honest approach to accuracy I have ever seen in a consumer product. It’s based on: ‘sigma = less than [a percentage and the length of test]. It is statistical probability specification of accuracy and it is rich in accuracy information. However, you need to do the math, understand what ‘sigma’ means in variance statistics, understand probability distribution curves, and then the use the spec to calculate the worst case accuracy of the device associated with your own radon situation). So, please do that before you criticize the device. If you studied the specification and did the math, as I have, you would see that it is quite accurate for an inexpensive radon continuous monitoring device.... and way more than suitable for home use.<br/><br/>Let me repeat that again. If you use the device as instructed by the manufacturer and are willing to trust the specification as determined by some very smart people who spent a lot of time, money and brainpower to prepare it, then you will be measuring Radon and its variability in your home in a way that is vastly superior to doing periodic mail away tests.<br/><br/>The radon in your home varies from day to day, month to month, hour to hour. The anecdotal ‘evidence of accuracy’ presented in virtually all of these reviews is absolutely without merit. Why, because determining the accuracy of the device against a standard source is extremely complicated. As a chemist I know that for a fact. We, as customers, do not have the time, money, equipment, or knowledge to do it - period. If you are somehow guessing that you need better accuracy in a shorter period of testing then please consider buying the Corentium pro for $1200 or perhaps some other professional device. You may not get better accuracy but you will likely get equivalent accuracy in a shorter period of time.... that’s how the statistics work. Please read the last two sentences again.<br/><br/>Consider this too. The manufacturer, Air Things, is based in Europe and it appears to be a spin off of CERN in Geneva, Switzerland. Look up CERN in Wiki. You will be impressed. They are the world’s leading experts on making and measuring radiation. I am impressed because their ‘no calibration necessary’ technology for this device (and their more expensive professional models) seems to be the result of a micro miniaturized, more precise spectroscopic technology for measuring radioactive decay of radon daughters alpha particle emissions.<br/><br/>Finally, I’ve read  literally hundreds of these Amazon reviews where accuracy is mentioned... and actually is somehow mysteriously determined in the basement of their home. However, I’ve not seen one review that references the manufacturer’s specification. Everyone here that’s comparing ‘this to that’ or ‘that to this’ and making claims about ‘accuracy’ doesn’t have a clue what they are talking about. However, a number of thoughtful reviewers seem to have run side by side tests with other devices or mail away canisters. Assuming those tests were done properly, then they can be considered slightly helpful but otherwise of no use in determining the device’s accuracy.<br/><br/>I’m going by the specification. I’m confident in my device and am very relieved that I own one.<br/><br/>—-  UPDATE: April 28, 2021  I bought a second unit a couple months after purchasing the first, so both are now over two years old. I am very happy with both units. No problems - I lent one out to my daughter for a few months. Now I keep one in the basement and the other on the first floor.  I recently replaced the batteries in the first unit (a two year battery life - just like the manufacturer said) and have had no problems at all with either unit.<br/><br/>Regarding Accuracy - I am reiterating that the Airthings accuracy specifications (which result from the highly advanced ‘spectroscopic’ technology behind it) are extraordinary for a low priced unit. Don’t believe the misinformation from reviewers here who claim to have determined the ‘accuracy’ of their Airthings unit as bad or good by running some kind of ‘test’.  You/ Me / Other Reviewers /  cannot in any way determine the accuracy of any type of radon device or test kit on the market - not for any device - not for any manufacturer). Period.<br/><br/>The only choice you have for determining the accuracy of any device you buy is to trust the manufacturer, the manufacturer’s statistical process control, and that the manufacturer truly, deeply understands the extremely complex issues in radon measurement. The Airthings company was founded by CERN scientists. CERN is where many of the smartest on this planet create and measure radiation with the Large Hadron Collider (LHC). So... I trust the Airthings accuracy specification.<br/><br/>So - If you really want to know the accuracy of any type of any radon monitoring detector you purchase (regardless of the manufacturer), here is what I would recommend so as to get decent accuracy results.<br/>- identify an analytical laboratory highly specialized and experienced in the many complexities of radon measurement<br/>- ensure that it is a laboratory using standards and equipment based on measuring radon in the atomic form(s) in which it is most carcinogenic,<br/>- send them your device and have it tested under tightly controlled laboratory conditions for a period of time (that is dependent on the rate at which that particular device model approaches the true radon value).<br/><br/>For me, buying two of the Airthings devices was an easy decision once I researched and understood the issues in Radon measurement, and the various devices available.<br/><br/>As I said previously, I have no affiliation of any kind with this company, but I do get frustrated when reviewers who have no clue what they are talking about provide horrible misinformation for the rest of us.</span>

Product Description   The Kidde Nighthawk Carbon Monoxide Detector & Propane, Natural, & Explosive Gas Detector, AC Plug-In with Battery Backup & Digital Display, model 900-0113, is powered by a 120VAC wall outlet with a 9-volt alkaline battery for backup during a power failure. Using electrochemical sensing technology, the combination carbon monoxide alarm & gas detector warns with alarm & digital display. For CO detection, the alarm will sound & the display will report out the levels of carbon monoxide in parts per million (PPM). For explosive gas detection, the alarm will sound and the display will identify "GAS" as present. The digital display will have a red dot in the lower right corner that will blink to indicate normal operation. The Smart Hush feature silences the fire alarm for approximately 8 minutes. UL Certified with a 5-year limited warranty. Meets requirements of UL 2034.   Amazon.com   Protect your family from the dangers of carbon monoxide (CO), methane, and propane exposure with the Kidde KN-COEG-3 Nighthawk Plug-In Carbon Monoxide and Explosive Gas Alarm. The Nighthawk is an easy-to-install unit that provides reliable protection against the dangers of CO and explosive gas. The digital display shows if gas is present indicates CO levels in parts per million, allowing you to see if, how, and when levels change.Advanced Technology in an Easy-to-Install, Plug-In DesignDesigned for home use, the Kidde KN-COEG-3 Nighthawk is a UL-listed, A/C-powered, plug-in alarm that utilizes sophisticated electronic components and sensor technology to protect you and your family from the dangers of CO, methane, and propane exposure. It plugs directly into a standard A/C outlet and includes a 9-volt battery backup that provides continuous monitoring--even during power outages.The Dangers of Carbon Monoxide, Methane, and Propane ExposureThe leading cause of accidental poisoning deaths in North America, carbon monoxide (CO) is often referred to as the silent killer because it's odorless, tasteless, and invisible. Carbon monoxide poisoning can come about via a number of sources, including everyday items and appliances in your home or office. And because symptoms of CO poisoning mimic the flu or other common illnesses it can often go undiagnosed.Likewise, methane and propane gases are commonly used in homes for cooking, heating, and water heating. Although it happens rarely, gas leaks can sometimes occur inside the home, increasing the risk of fire or explosion.Audible Alarm Pattern Alerts you to Elevated CO and Gas LevelsWhen placed on every level of your home, alarms like the KN-COEG-3 Nighthawk can help protect everyone in the house by giving you an unmistakable signal when gas levels have reached an unhealthy point. If unhealthy levels of CO are detected, the alarm will emit four quick audible beeps every five seconds until either levels decrease or the reset button is pressed. If methane gas or propane gas is detected, the alarm will emit beeps every other second with "GAS" shown in the display.Easy-to-Read Digital Display Shows CO LevelsThe KN-COEG-3 Nighthawk is preferred among traditional CO and explosive gas alarms because of its digital display. This display clearly shows levels of CO that the unit has detected and stored-- from 30 to 999 ppm--and it updates every 15 seconds to indicate any abrupt changes or alarming trends. The display also shows the peak CO level recorded by the alarm since it was last reset or unplugged. The continuous display also shows if gas is present.LED Shows Sensor StatusWith the KN-COEG-3 Nighthawk, you never have to wonder if the sensor is functioning properly. A blinking dot in the lower right-hand corner of the display denotes normal operation, so you can trust that it's working. In addition, you can test alarm function by pressing the test/reset button at any time to verify that the horn and electric circuitry are operating properly.Convenient Mounting OptionsThe KN-COEG-3 Nighthawk has a low-profile design that makes it suitable for any room in your home. The detector can be plugged into any standard A/C outlet; it's plug can be snapped into the back of the unit and can be rotated so the alarm remains vertical, independent of whether the electrical socket is mounted vertically or horizontally.

  From the Manufacturer   The leading cause of accidental poisoning deaths in North America, Carbon Monoxide is odorless, tasteless and invisible. It is a silent killer. Kidde CO alarms include the most accurate sensing technology available, the patented Nighthawk electrochemical sensor. This unit is an AC powered, plug-in CO and explosive gas alarm that protects you and your family from two deadly threats. The 900-0113 includes 9V battery back up that provides protection during a power outage, when AC only units can not provide protection. By pressing the Peak Level Button you can see the peak CO level recorded by the alarm since it was last reset or unplugged. The continuous digital display shows you the level of carbon monoxide, if any. The unit is sensing as well as if gas is present. The gas sensor is a metal oxide sensor designed to detect natural gas , methane or propane. Install at least one CO alarm on every floor and in sleeping areas. Make sure CO alarms are at least 15 feet away from cooking or heating appliances to prevent false alarms. Replace CO alarms every 5 to 7 years to benefit from the latest technology upgrades.

<span>This is the third purchase of this model over 12 years time. Mind lasted 5-7 years each. Just plug in (ensure battery inserted in case of power outage), then hit the test button and it simulates a gas leak alarm, then resets. Best to have any pets out of the room as the alarm is very loud. The first purchase years ago alarmed about 45 minutes after lighting the first fire of the fall season in my fireplace and I forgot to open the damper. It alarmed for carbon monoxide.  Like that  it detects gas leaks as well. The key is is placing the unit low for propane as its a heavy gas, but high for natural gas as it’s light gas.</span>

<span>This unit is a replacement for an identical unit that I had in my basement that had reached end of life (it notifies you when its' usable life is ended).  A few years ago the unit alerted me to a slight gas leak from the input line to our home heating unit. The utility company came out and tightened a loose connector. This amounted to correcting a minor problem that could have been a disaster without this unit.  I now have two of them in different areas of my finished basement to serve as an early warning for both CO2 and Natural gas leaks. They are simple to install and don't require any maintenance except to change the back up 9v battery every few years. Worth every penny for the safety they provide.</span>

<span>These are amazing for home use and just getting an overview of air quality.  I would not have been able to make actionable decisions without 3 sensors set up.  I used them to detect radon first and control airflow to mitigate.  Secondly use them for VOC and Temp+humidity.  Would be nice if they worked with Alexa.  Keep in mind these need a calibration time.  Also, they really won’t give you enough info on VOCs to really understand anything actionable.  You are best to use them as a guide to make the best decisions.  I’m still ailing with irritated nose and throat after running these for some time and trying windows open, closed, vents, fans, filters.  I wish I could have used them to make a sound solid decision as to where the problem air is coming from and to what the problem is to mitigate.  Basically I put one in the attic, living room, bedroom (radon), garage (radon), outdoor protected (radon).  They have helped me make better decisions.  I think every home should have one of these.  Be sure to properly label your location so the data collected will be used correctly to report to other home owners in the area on radonmap.com.  Everyone needs at least the basic radon version of these!</span>
