<span>This is the first printer that I bought for my law school apartment and overall it really is a fantastic first printer. I'm so lucky to have been able to save up for a laser printer with gift cards and catch this one on sale as brother is a great company. I know the laser printer is going to save me a ton of money in the future on ink and the print quality is fantastic! As someone who needs to print mainly text documents its perfect for me.<br/>My one complaint is that the printer often has trouble connecting to my macbook. Its such a strange problem because even when it won't print from the laptop it has no issue printing from my ipad or iphone. However, its frustrating to have to send the document to another device each time I need a printed copy. I can't seem to figure out how to resolve this issue, just sometimes it prints and other times it says it cannot print and can't send the document through.<br/>Otherwise I'd recommend this device, but be wary that if you only have a laptop you may run into some printing problems.</span>

La instalación fue fácil para el celular; aunque en realidad para encontrar la manera de hacerlo en el laptop fue un poco complicada, a pesar de que también es un HP. Me parece fatal que no haya disponibilidad de soporte técnico un fin de semana, más aún sabiendo que HP es una marca de renombre y no es que sea la más asequible.<br/>Sin embargo, la logré instalar en mis dos dispositivos y esperando a que en realidad haya sido una buena compra.<br/>---------------------<br/>I used some stickers for privacy purposes. However, after printing a picture, it looks like a clear and very good quality print to me. Setting up the printer in my cell phone was really easy. However, to set the printer in the laptop was really complicated in despite that they both are HP devices. It's catastrophic that Technical support don't have any service during the weekend and, much more knowing that they are a big brand all around the world and not the cheapest BTW.<br/>Even though, I finally succeeded setting up the printer in both devices and hopefully it'll be a good purchase.</span><span class="cr-translated-review-content aok-hidden"></span>

It was followed by an HP DeskJet 940c color printer; this printer still works, but it is now difficult to find its cartridges (I only purchase HP cartridges, and the printer rejects out-of-date cartridges) and its function is limited to printing only.  My printers since then have been HP OfficeJet Pro All-in-One Printer/Scanner/Fax — HP 8610, HP 8630, and HP 8740 — each of which has unique problems.  The HP 8610 will scan to USB, but ruins the USB drive to which files and images are scanned.  The HP 8630 fails to recognize or acknowledge the presence of a USB drive but it will scan to PC’s using its wireless capabilities and it can print using both of its paper trays.  The HP 8740, the worst until now, fails to recognize or acknowledge the presence of USB drives, it will not scan to PCs unless the PC initiates the connection, it has frequent paper jams, and the second paper tray is useless as the unit will not acknowledge its presence.  As you might imagine, it is disappointing to spend money — at the time $399, $299, and $349 (after coupon and price-match), respectively — on these all-in-one printer/scanner/fax units and not be able to use all their stated features.<br/><br/>That said, the HP OfficeJet Pro 9015e is no different — it has problems too.  The first problem I noticed while removing it from the box is the lower quality of the build of the device.  The quality of my HP 8610, HP 8630, and HP 8740 is far greater than that of the HP 9015e; it feels cheap in comparison to the HP 8610, HP 8630, and HP 8740.  The HP 9015e does not even have a real paper tray — the back of its “paper tray” is open:  there are two long plastic hooks and no distinct location for the back placement of the paper.  Real paper trays have a clear front and back location for the paper within the tray.  The front door of the HP 9015e, via which one accesses the cartridges, does not have the high quality feel of the front doors of the HP 8610, HP 8630, and HP 8740, and this door does not close as soundly (and is not flush against the body of the unit!) as that of the other three units.  The HP 9015e does not even have a power button with a solid feel as the HP 8610, HP 8630, and HP 8740.  The sounds of the working HP 9015e are not satisfying as those for the HP 8610, HP 8630, and HP 8740:  the HP 9015e sounds rickety and as if it is falling apart.  Every time I print something, I wonder if this will be the last page I can print — I have owned this printer for less than one month at the writing of this review and there was a two-week delay before I could set up the printer at my office:  I should not feel this way about a brand new printer.  The output “tray” for the HP 9015e  is a disappointment and it does not hold printed pages well; it certainly does not hold printed pages as securely as the HP 8610, HP 8630, or HP 8740.  So far, I have been able to print several pages as well as scan to PC, initiated via the PC, but I have not been able to test the unit to its full extent.<br/><br/>Installation using the HP Smart App was TERRIBLE!  The connection options for the HP 9015e are wireless, ethernet, and USB:  all three should work, yet the HP Smart App refused to install the printer via USB connection.  After trying to connect the HP 9015e to my Windows 10 PC multiple times — too many times — using the HP Smart App, I downloaded the only other available software option to provide printer/scanner funtionality.  This software was also problematic as it directed me to wireless or ethernet connection, rather than USB connect to PC.  However, after multiple attempts, the USB connection between the HP 9015e and my PC was established — and accepted by the software; one should not have to endure inquires from software regarding one’s choice of connection type — the owner of the device chooses the connection type, not HP via its software/app.<br/><br/>Since I need a printer/scanner/fax at my office, I decided to keep the HP 9015e, rather than to return it.  However, I do have concerns about how long it will function and I am still in the process of determining which of its stated functions operate properly.  I do not appreciate HP trying to dictate how I connect and use the printer for which I paid:  I chose the USB connection and I chose to disable wireless printing since the printer is for my use (I paid for the printer and I pay for the cartridges), not for the use of others (who may wish to try to establish a wireless connection) at my place of work.  It is worth mentioning that the HP+ option did not appear when I installed the HP 9015e using the software rather than the HP Smart App; this is not good business, HP, as everyone purchasing this unit should be offered the same “bonus” options.<br/><br/>Based on my experience with a firmware update for my HP 8630, I would recommend that you disable HP updates.  After the last firmware update, my HP 8630 would not recognize the perfectly functional printhead installed in the printer; I had used my printer without issues prior to this firmware update.  After that update the HP 8630 displayed a message that the printhead was now missing or damaged!  To make a long story short, I was forced to purchase a new printhead for $179 in order to continue to use this printer!  I view this as unacceptable and bad business on the part of HP.  I have no intention of going through that for the HP 9015e; I plan to turn off HP updates so that they cannot be installed via my PC.<br/><br/>Due to the various problems that I have had with the HP 8610, HP 8630, and HP 8740 (especially its paper jams and the non-functional second paper tray), the HP 9015e may be my last HP printer because its build-quality does not compare favorably to any of the three.  What happened to the quality of my original HP laserjet and my HP 940c????  I have to wonder about the quality of future HP printers or HP all-in-one units based on the cheap feel of the HP 9015e.  I am disappointed, and I would not recommend purchasing the HP 9015e.</span>

<span>This is a great little printer and I use in in my home/office. I love the air-printing function, printing from my cell phone from different rooms in the house. My only complaint is the rather small touch-screen; nevertheless, it fine but you need to be close to read it.</span>

<span>Buy this if you like ugly scans and want to waste a day+ of your life fighting buggy install software. I spent at least that long setting this up on 3 windows laptops. The install process fails in different ways on each device, even on each separate attempt. I made at least 5 attempts per device till both scanning and printing were working at the same time. Each attempt is waiting on 5minute to infinite progress bard. What on earth can take minutes when electrons are flying at the speed of light?? Either printing or scanning wouldn't work most of the time, just one or the other. I tried the hp stupid software first, failed almost every time in different ways, even though it saw the printer on the network. Be careful not to use an Wifi 6 AX access point, or it'll silently fail. I tried installing the separate drivers as well when hp stupid wouldn't work. That didn't work either, searching the network forever even after it found the printer once. On one device I couldn't even log into their dumb hp+ service as part of the install. My other device I started after the first one got stuck already registered, while the first device was still waiting infinitely. I won't go into all the hundreds of failure modes. Suffice it to say I'm a programmer and it took me a day. Just getting the printer working is easy, you don't even need the hp stupid software, but if you want scan to computer to work, you're in for a world of pain. I don't care about any of the rest of the stupid features. Anyways, I think I finally have it working. Until it breaks. The 8610 also randomly forgot how to do scan to computer, so remains to be seen.<br/><br/>The other downfall is the scanner. The quality of the scans is atrocious, heavy moire patterns when scanning any printed material, which is all material these days, since film photos don't exist anymore. No settings to fix it. Even scanning at 1200dpi and trying every conceivable downsampling mode can't fix the moire. In some cases it just returns random pure white pixels all over the image (maybe it's point sampling the white of the paper in between the dithered printing??). I think the sensor just uses zero anti-aliasing, which makes it practically unusable for any quality scanning. For scanning odd documents it's fine if you don't mind the ugly blurry, noisy results. Also the jpeg compression is atrocious. Coupled with the moire it gives some impressively terrible scans. The 8610 suffers from some of these issues, but not as bad. 9018 is just horrible. Also, 8610 was way more convenient. It would scan to a folder, in jpeg or multi-page pdf, and open that folder on your machine, ready to drag and drop into an email or whatever. Not so with 9018. It scans only in jpeg to the crappy windows scan and fax program, where it's extra steps to get your file into an email, no pdf option, doesn't scan from document feeder, only the flatbed, crap quality, etc etc. How can HP be THIS crap? It would be so easy to fix these things, and instead they made this WORSE than the ancient 8610. HOW?? Using the scan and fax software, some of these things are solvable, like document feeder, but not the scan quality, it seems, since I think it's a hardware problem, too sharp point sampling. Though, interestingly, somehow the copy function doesn't suffer from this moire. No idea how, but no such setting seems available from scanning software. Also can't do multi-page pdf's with windows scan and fax like 8610 could. Just worse in every way.<br/><br/>From the menus it also seems like there's no way to stop it from shutting off completely every 8 hours. However, it hasn't shut off in a couple of days with no activity, and I can print to it. Strange. But good, because that would be a dealbreaker.</span>

<span>Setup for printing, scanning, and copying was easy. The written directions that come with the printer are clear. I chose to set up on my Mac first and add the mobile device afterward. That is the reverse of the order HP recommends. But as a senior I find the computer screen easier to see and navigate than the smaller iPhone screen.<br/><br/>The printer goes offline when not in use. If you try to print while it is offline, you get a message that the computer can’t find the printer. This can be fixed by manually entering the IP Address in the Printers and Scanners App (Mac). If you don’t know how to do this, HP’s tech support will talk you through it.<br/><br/>Setting up the fax is a bit complicated if you use the same telephone line for voice and fax.<br/><br/>I mainly print and scan, make occasional copies and mostly send rather than receive faxes.</span>

<span>Only thing keeping it from 5 stars is it seems a little flimsy from my previous HP printer.  But I feel this is just trying to make things less expensive on the manufacturing side.  The print quality, auto feeder feature, scan all are top level quality so far.  I just feel like I have to be real careful pulling out trays and opening the top to replace print cartridges but so far we are very happy with it especially the size.  We have two school age kids and my wife runs her home based business off of it.</span>

<span>I have owned HP printers forever.  Our old HP all in one was still going after 12 years but the scanner bed had gotten dirty and I also decided it was time to upgrade because I needed double sided printing and also the ability to print wirelessly from my iPhone and iPad.  A nearby Office Depot was closing its doors and having a big blow out sale to get rid of all its inventory so I decided to go look at printers thinking I could get a screaming deal.  I talked to one of the sales associates about my needs and she said this was a very popular model that offered all the features I want and then some.  They had it marked down from $180 to about $153 on sale.  Before I bought it I do what I always do and checked Amazon and was shocked to find that the exact same printer in the exact same package was only $99 with Prime!  I bid farewell to Office Depot (no wonder they're closing) and went right home and ordered it!<br/><br/>I have to say, so far I REALLY LOVE this printer!  First of all, it was the easiest printer to set up EVER!!  I mean, I truly couldn't believe it!  I'm a gadget tech nerd (built my own PC) and was prepared to have to spend an hour getting it all unpacked, turned on, calibrated, set up on my network and also connected to my devices for wireless printing.  That's what I'm used to.  Set up of this printer BLEW MY MIND with how simple it was!  Literally, you take it out of the box and remove all foam and plastic etc., plug it into the wall, press power, insert the ink (SO simple) and follow the instructions on screen to align the cartridges.  Once it was aligned the touch screen informed me to go to hp.com/setup to download the drivers I would need.  My computer/network automatically detected the printer and knew just what drivers I needed.  Download and setup was a breeze!  You can use the provided disk instead but I didn't even remove it from the sleeve.  The one thing I would say about HP and their software is that they tend to over do it.  My recommendation is to select the option that enables you to choose which additional programs you want installed instead of letting HP do it for you.  I always get way more than I bargain for and end up uninstalling a lot of the "bloatware" programs that I don't use that just take up HD space like HP photo etc.  I use photoshop.  There is an option for just the basic drivers that you can select.  Your printer will work just fine with those and you won't get blogged down with unwanted software.  Either way works great though.  I tried both.  The driver setup took 5 minutes.  Then I got on my iPhone and downloaded the HP ePrint app which IMMEDIATELY recognized and connected to my printer all on its own!  You can use it to print from your photos, the web, email and the cloud.  AWESOME!!!  That was it!  In about 12 minutes from the box I was completely set up, connect and printing!<br/><br/>Here are some other things I love about this printer:<br/><br/>- Fastest setup of any printer ever (yes I know I already mentioned this but it deserves repeating).  No having to manually enter IP addresses or anything like that!<br/>- Design is very sleek and modern.  I love the all black with little color screen!  It's pretty sexy as printers go!<br/>- Small/slim profile.  For everything this printer does and how well/quickly it does it, it really is quite small!  WAY smaller than my old HP all in one!<br/>- Touch screen is really high quality!  I often get frustrated with touch screens at check out stands and elsewhere because they're not very sensitive to your finger or pressing down in one spot causing a neighboring button to be selected.  That is NOT the case with this touch screen.  I find that it's very sensitive and accurate and also the display is crisp and beautiful!<br/>- AUTOMATIC DOUBLE SIDED PRINTING AND SCANNING.  HALLELUJAH!<br/>- Printing is very fast and the print quality is excellent, even and especially with photos!<br/>- I LOVE that this printer only needs one cable (unless you want to use the fax feature as well) and works so well wirelessly!<br/>- Printing from the app on my mobile devices is my new favorite thing<br/>- Unlike my old printer, this guy is whisper quiet when it's printing.  It's a little thing, but I live with an autistic 4 year old and a husband who sounds like he's calling in air support for a military strike when he talks on the phone so...sometimes the little things make a big difference!<br/>- Scan quality is really fabulous!<br/><br/>Honestly, I rarely give 5 star reviews to things, but this printer really does deserve it, from price point to set up to functionality and features.  I HIGHLY recommend this printer for all your in home office needs!  And no, I didn't get it for free or at a discount.  I paid full price for it and I would do it again!  I hope this helps someone else who is looking for an office upgrade!<br/><br/>UPDATE 1/21/17 - After a couple weeks I started having issues with this printer going offline spontaneously and the only way I could seem to get it back online to was by restarting my computer.  Around that time we also bought a Roku 4 and started having trouble with streaming.  The signal was dropping all the time.  I finally realized that it was because of our router, which, while a great work horse for many years, was getting seriously old in "tech years" and needed to be replaced.  I bought a dual band Asus router and ever since I installed it we have not only had flawless streaming but the printer now stays "online" all the time!  If you're having this issue with it going offline, I would look at your network setup before you blame the printer itself.</span>

<span>I have had many HP inkjet printers over the past 20 years, and this one isn't my favorite, but it gets the job done for a small Home Office. For us, the Home Office is defined as 2-4 computers running Windows or Mac OS, 30-100 pages printed per week, 300 scans per week). Despite the printer not being the best option for heavy scanning, it makes sense for printing quickly and cheaply in color. The ink quality on documents and worksheets that contain photos or clipart is rich, and outshines some color lasers I have used.<br/><br/>PROS:<br/>- Fantastic scanning of color-text documents. The scanning bed and auto-feed pick up great details from 75 to 1200 DPI.<br/>- The Auto Document Feeder (ADF) can actually handle quite a bit more than 35 pages! If you’re scanning hundreds of double-sided worksheets, you don’t need to babysit the ADF.<br/>- HP Easy Scan is a MUST for Mac OS users to get the most out of the scanning features. While Mac OS has great built-in scanning software, you’ll want access to Searchable Text PDF options only provided in the HP Easy Scan that uses fantastically accurate OCR software (courtesy of ReadIRIS software). I am archiving multi-language Hungarian, Japanese and English documents, and picking the more character complex language (i.e., Japanese) allows me to capture the Roman letters of Hungarian and English. Unfortunately, there is no multi-language function so it doesn’t pick up the accented Roman letters of Hungarian if I set it to OCR Japanese.<br/>- AirPrint and Bonjour functionality meant the printer was quickly and immediately discovered on our Mac systems running Mac OS 10.12 and beyond. We might've gone to Apple Support to install the latest of all HP Printer Drivers, but it was a quick fix that allowed printing within seconds.<br/>- Has USB port in easily accessible location on front of printer.<br/><br/>CONS:<br/>- Ink cartridges were very hard to release from orange twist-caps. We were concerned we would break them.<br/>- The Auto Document Feeder (ADF) rollers have a hard time picking up ultra glossy magazine paper.<br/>- The ADF CANNOT scan “too short documents” such as A5, or most "book-sized" documents. You’ll need a dedicated scanner for archiving books, unfortunately. This also means you cannot scan photos, business cards or receipts in the ADF, you must use the flatbed.<br/>- The "Scan to Computer" function is grossly under-supported. There is no Scan to Computer functionality for Mac OS--you must activate the scanner from the Mac in either Image Capture or HP Easy Scan. I recommend HP Easy Scan because of the Searchable Text function.<br/>- The printing drivers and scanning software on Windows systems is extremely slapdash. Windows 7 and some Windows 10 computers had a hard time finding the printer on the same Wi-Fi network. Once it was found, the Windows 7 computer took some time to locate the printer using HP Easy Scan/Scan to Computer. HP appears to have retired HP Easy Scan for their new "HP Smart" app for Windows 10 computers. But the new HP Smart app is also extremely buggy and may not find the printer, even when you type in the IPv4 address of the printer directly into it. The options on where to save the scanned files is also lacking. I set up 5 Windows Machines and 3 Macs to this printer for scanning--I spent 2 minutes on each Mac and about 20-30 minutes per Windows machine--including Windows 10! I do not have confidence in others to know the nuance for HP Easy Scan and HP Smart for scanning.<br/>- Cannot scan to network folders (i.e., if you have FTP or Shared Folders set up via your home office router, this cannot connect to them via SMB protocol). We don't need it since there is a shared public folder on one Windows machine where we'll save the Scanned Documents. It's a work around, sure, but it works.</span>

<blockquote><em><div class="a-row a-spacing-small review-data"><span class="a-size-base review-text review-text-content" data-hook="review-body">
<span>I offer this review as a comparison in an attempt to help someone choose between the Brother ScanNCut and the Circut Maker.  I have had the ScanNCut for about 8 months.  I recently sold my Cricut Maker, and I currently own a Cricut Joy.<br/><br/>As my focus is mainly on card making and cutting cardstock and paper, I find the ScanNCut works better for me because I can cut directly from the machine, using the touchscreen.  In other words, it is not necessary to use a computer.  That being said, if I am working on something large or if I really need to see what I am working on, I find working on the computer to be more efficient.<br/><br/>Cricut offers Apple iPad or iPhone apps to get away from the computer; however, I still prefer the computer for larger projects.  Brother has just developed an app, but I have not heard good things about it and have yet to try it myself.<br/><br/>The Brother Software is more complicated than Cricut (less complicated that Silhouette); however, if you have any experience with any kind of design software, you will pick it up quickly.  I never liked using Cricut's Design Space.  I found it to be slow and very limited, but I now appreciate some of that simplicity, and Cricut does update it quite often.  Both have a slight learning curve.<br/><br/>The Cricut machine itself feels sturdier than the ScanNCut, but, also heavier.  I never doubted that the Cricut would last years.  In addition, all of the Cricut tools are strong and well made.<br/><br/>The Brother pen tool is small and flimsy, but it works fine.  The pens/markers for Cricut are proprietary, expensive and don't last long.  There is a universal pen tool for the ScanNCut, which claims to provide the ability for you to use "any pen or marker" you may already own.  I have purchased this, but not tried it yet.<br/><br/>On the Brother machine itself, there are certain images/words that are line only, so you can quickly draw/write a line without searching for hours with Cricut to find a font that will just simply write words using normal lines instead of outlines and then having to pay for them.<br/><br/>The Brother mats are flimsy, hard to find, ridiculously expensive and, let me tell you, the standard mat that comes with the machine is much too tacky for cardstock, to the point where it can make for a pretty miserable experience.  It is nearly impossible to remove the design from the mat without destroying the project, which means, I had to buy the light tack mat (expensive).  Cricut mats, in my opinion, are far superior and, for the most part, easily and inexpensively replaced.<br/><br/>The Brother foiling tool (sold separately) seems complicated and messy.  I do not own that, but, from what I've seen, the machine applies some sort of glue to adhere the foil to.  Foiling on the Cricut is fairly simple, clean and easy.  I had this tool for the Maker and I have it for the Joy.<br/><br/>Purchasing extra images with the Brother is complicated and annoying.  You cannot buy one image or one project, as far as I can tell.  You must by a pack of 25 "designs" for $25.00 and they don't seem to be just images, they appear to be projects as well.  Not only that, but they are not instant downloads.  You have to order some sort of card with a scratch-off section revealing a number to type into the software.  In this day and age, I would think this is unnecessary.  In addition, I have yet to find out whether your purchases stay with you or the machine, meaning that if you upgrade machines in the future, do you have to start all over with the extras?<br/><br/>You do have to pay for anything more you want to do with either machine, i.e. foiling, embossing, etc.  The Brother foiling kit is $43 at the time of this writing; calligraphy, rhinestones - $70 at the time of this writing; enhanced image tracing seems to be included with the purchase of an additional design pack - $38+; stamp maker starter kit - $35 at the time of this writing; embossing - $57 at the time of this writing; engraving (I think this is third-party only) - $45; paper piercing - $80 at the time of this writing; printable sticker starter kit - $57 at the time of this writing, etc.<br/><br/>This is similar to buying the extra tools for the Cricut; however, I am under the impression that you must purchase a "starter kit" for each add-on for the Brother.  The Cricut tools go on sale often.<br/><br/>I feel like the print and cut and enhanced image tracing with the ScanNCut should be free or the machine should be cheaper (the SDX85 is cheaper, but the screen size is smaller and, apparently, contains less images with purchase).  On the bright side, Brother does not try to push a subscription (another monthly bill) down your throat every time you open the software.<br/><br/>You can score with the Brother without buying anything extra.  You need to insert a dash line wherever you want to score.  They don't call it scoring and this information does not seem to be well-known, despite this feature being intentional, not a hack.<br/><br/>The auto blade on the ScanNCut is great and the replacements are affordable.  You don't have to dial anything in when cutting different types of paper, cardstock, felt, foam, etc.  No added step of selecting your materials.<br/><br/>Cricut tutorials are everywhere on YouTube.  You have to dig for information on Brother ScanNCut, as far as from every-day users.  Brother does have a considerable amount of video tutorials, but, sometimes, an average user can provide more of an accurate explanation regarding limitations, etc.<br/><br/>The scanning feature is the main selling point here, as well as the ability to very quickly and simply cut a flower or a tree or some other "die cut," if you have that design stored in the machine, but, then again, where would you find just an image of a Christmas tree or a mushroom?  I guess you would have to locate it outside of Brother.<br/><br/>The other wonderful thing about the scanner is you can put scrap pieces of material on your mat, scan it into the machine and then move the images on the screen to where the material is on your mat.  This is similar to Cricut's Snap Mat feature (not available for the Joy), which is only available with Cricut's app.<br/><br/>I believe the bottom line here is if you work, primarily with vinyl, leather, thin wood, fabric, etc.  The Cricut Maker would be the way to go.  I feel as though the Cricut Maker is perfect for the all-around home hobbyist or small craft business.<br/><br/>If you use rubber stamps and cardstock and would love a machine to "fussy cut" your images or prefer not to use the computer for everything, the Brother ScanNCut would be the way to go.  Albeit, very expensive just to use as a scanner, but not having to purchase separate dies to go with stamps could possibly mean the machine pays for itself over a short period of time.<br/><br/>All of that being said, I love the ScanNCut.  It suits me better than the Maker.  I did not like the Maker and hadn't used it much in the 2 years that I owned it.  I kept buying additional tools and ended up not using those either because it just seemed like too much work to get anything done.<br/><br/>I do find the Brother more enjoyable, less frustrating and more fun to use for what I do.  I find I am more motivated to go into my craft room now that I have it.  Much less time on a computer is important to me, as I work with computers all day.  However, it is my opinion that the price of the mats is unfair for what they are.  This could and probably should be a "deal breaker."  Brother should either increase the durability/longevity of the mats or reduce the price dramatically.  There are several YouTube videos of people adding various tacky glues to revive the Brother mats; some are even cutting out the centers and replacing them with Cricut mats.  That should tell Brother something.<br/><br/>In addition, for some reason, at the time of this review, the consumables and/or add-ons seem to be difficult to get in the United States.<br/><br/>I would highly recommend you do your own research and watch as many tutorial videos as you can find before purchasing, so you know what you are getting into.  All in all, the machines are designed in a way that they don't truly compete with one another, unlike the comparison between a Silhouette and Cricut.</span>

<span>My HP 3 in 1 printer that I bought a long time ago finally died. So first and foremost HP products are awesome. The printer I had before which had the copy and the scanner I actually bought it at Costco and I'm going to say I had that machine for 10 years.<br/><br/>So when that one died I saw this one on Amazon and noticed the price had come down and I had to have something so low and behold I bought it. It's a nice little machine they have a program where you can buy ink for the machine at a discount rate if you join this club thing I think it's for 6 months. For me it just really wasn't worth it I would just rather buy the ink on my own. But it may work for you. I like to get the remanufacturing. And there's a couple of places that I buy it through online. I actually haven't checked here on Amazon but I will do that.<br/><br/>The scanning feature works perfectly I have no complaints. The copy feature works like a charm! And it folds up nice and neat. You pull out a little flap and it has a paper guide from when your item is done printing or copying and then it folds nicely back up. She don't have any flap sticking out that will break or anything like that it's nice it's perfect compact I love it. Also the other thing that I like about this machine is that instead of the paper being fed from the front there's actually a paper guide so you can only put in so many sheets of paper which prevents it from getting stuck into the roller. So if anyone has any doubts I would say go ahead and get this it comes quickly it's pretty easy to figure out. I highly recommend this.</span>

<span>My old HP printer gave out and since I'd had such good service from the brand, I bought this as a replacement. I needed all-in-one capability, which this printer has--scanning, copying, printing- and I wanted wireless capability. For some reason, I felt like the instructions to set this up to get the wireless capability started were just not as clear as they could have been. I finally resorted to just common sense after some frustrating tries, and got it working, but frankly, I still don't know how I got there. No matter. Once it was connected wirelessly it worked perfectly. The print quality is great, it's responsive, and it does exactly what I need it to do. It's a simple printer for home use. Other than the annoying matter of the instructions, there's one other small detail that owners should be aware of: there's a small, pull-out extension to the finished print tray that's only about three inches wide and rotates out to extend maybe six inches or so. It's not the width of the fixed print tray. It looks like an option. It's not. Use it. If you don't, you're liable to find your print job has shot across the room all over the floor. Ask me how I know. First glance, the finished print tray appears to be long enough to keep the printed pages stacked in place, but it just isn't. Without that little extension rotated out, you're going to have to pick up your print job off the floor. OK, I know; it's an inexpensive printer. But another 50 cents worth of plastic to keep this from happening wouldn't have bankrupted Hewlett Packard.</span>

<span>Pros: great printer, easy setup, prints quality and quickly, comes with ink<br/><br/>Cons: there's something in the ink cartridges (a chip or sensor?) And when you set up your printer, you HAVE to subscribe to HP or whatever. It's free for 6 months so you get free ink, but after that you have to pay, so make sure you're either prepared for that or set an alarm to cancel your subscription so you don't get billed.<br/>I tried to opt out at first but it said if I don't do it, I won't be able to complete set up.

<span>I bought to use with foiling and paper crafting. Hubby decided to upgrade from his 1996 HP monochrome laser to an expensive color laser and he refused to let me buy generic toner drums for it and continue to use the old and true. However it did have some probems as it did not handle cardstock well. In the end rather than fight it I ordered this rather older model though still being made brother laser monocolor printer. And it has not let me down. As cheap as some of it feels overall it's wonderful. My two favorite things is it is a SMALL FOOT PRINT working next to my huge 19" color inkjet printer it's tiny. And it allows me to do straight passes which so far have accepted all cardstocks I've tried. I used a color 110# card stock and both 65 and 85 special smooth extra white cardstock I buy here on Amazon and everyone printed well and then laminated well when foiling. Extremely happy. Did I mention the TINY size. I intend to travel with this gem in a class b mini motor home so to speak and so continue to enjoy my hobby on the road trips too. I also splurged and upgraded my older legal size flat bed scanner with also an older obsolete fashion model by cannon that allows it to sit upright and feed upright or laid down for a flat bed but only 8.5x11 inch standard sheets. Again I'd been stuck with the albatross of over sized scanner cause hubby wanted this and when it arrived he rejected and stayed with his orginal even larger scanner. In the end he now is taking my reject and actually his all along and I'm finally enjoying the smaller sized officee hardware and more desk space. Love it. Now I know I could have gone with the color for less than 100 more in very similar size and Brother too but really I wanted to keep it simple. I want to test the waters without spending too much and leaves the bank account to spend more on FUN stuff like more cardstock and more foil patterns to play with. Look up H&amp;H signs for finding wonderful toner/textile foils they have a huge supply at great prices and note textile foil is what works with toner. Not all foils work the same way. So make sure you know which one  you are buying before buying or using the wrong one and ruining a project. (I have foils for glimmer hot embossing that is not the same foil. I have permanent vinyl foils for just that hardsurface applications, I have heat setting foils for just that ironing onto hard surfaces, paper and even fabrics. Then I have foils for toner work and yes they also work with some textile applications with special adhesive technques you may use with it. That I do not do just the toner to date. There also is foiling an foil flakes that work with tacky glues and pastes on cardstocks and fabrics too. So a lot to learn about foiling and that not all foils work across the board the same. I keep mine in different drawers labeled to insure I don't use the wrong product. Also to insure I get a good foil when it comes to fabric I always write on a flap or smaller to be applied piece of fabric rather than take the chance of ruining a tote bag etc. I spent hours sewing and damage it with a messed up foil job. Better to get the foiling done right before full assembly. So this printer I highly recommend if you know you are happy with no color other than BLACK print. It will do shades of gray by the way so it's possible to kind of play around with pencil drawings and get some lovely prints..I haven't tried to foil those however. Of course not. Meantime it does do two side printing but I don't do that. I don't want to worry about the interior getting dirty because I printed both sides. And with foil work  you don't want any extra toner specks on your work sheet to be foiled. If you do a brush that's great but if you go over the toner area you want to foil you can mess it up by removing too much and can't tell until it's foiled and little missed specks show up. Not sure why in Q/A they said you could not do cardstock. The bullet points say clearly you can. I proved you can. I would buy this printer again if something happens to this one. Should last a long time if I take care of it. And we take care of our hardwares and often my printers last well over 10 years and the scanner was over 19 years I just replaced. I also work with a windows 10 and a windows Xp machine. I do most of my graphics on The XP because a lot of the software I use and rely on is no longer supported sometimes no longer made and not for the W10's. So far the printer works flawlessly by either machine. I did not go with the Wifi version but my husband now wishes I would have. We got our comunications mixed up on that. No matter I'm happy and we've been married 50 years last month so we're fine and used to wee bits of nickering to keep us aligned and well. PS he hates his NEW COLOR Laser. He's got his eye on this Brother and that's ok too. He sneaks into my office area and uses my STUFF all the time. Ok sneaks not so much...he loves my big paper cutter and my Carl paper tirmmer and my various 4 different binder equipment. He used to offer to take them off my hands in fact. Silly guy...he's got his own. He's got the bigger office room with tons of drawers. But I've made my area work well with lots of clean work surfaces to lay out projects small and large. I know have embossing machines too. This little guy is going to get a huge work out and already passed with flying colors.</span>

<span>I bought this printer to replace a 14-year old Brother HL-5250DN Duplex printer. That printer has an Ethernet connector that I used as well as USB and LPT connectors that I did not use.  I needed a replacement printer that I could access on my network from various computers around the house.  This Brother HL-L2300D had everything the Brother HL-5250DN Duplex printer provided, but with only a USB connection.<br/><br/>I can report that I have installed this new Brother HL-L2300D on my wireless router USB port and have it printing flawlessly from my desktop and laptop.  I used no additional software other than what is built into the router and Windows 10.  The new printer's print quality is excellent, both the duplex printing and all other printing is quieter than the old printer, and it has a straight-through paper path for manual feed which improved envelope and label printing.  I have Continue Mode set ON and Auto Shutoff set OFF.  I have the new printer in a switched AC outlet, and only turn it on when I need it.  Using the switched outlet, the printer powers up and is ready to receive print jobs without having to press the Power button.  When I leave the switched outlet on and the printer falls asleep, the printer wakes up when the router sends it a print job.  This is exactly what I wanted.<br/><br/>I hope this review will provide anyone else who has similar requirements with a way to test their system to make sure that using a USB-only printer connected to a router will work for them too.  I read about using the USB port on my ASUS N900 RT-N66U Wireless router to set up a network print server and wanted to be sure that would work, so I used the old printer to test that.<br/><br/>I decided to use my desktop for this test and make no changes on the laptop until ready to install the new printer.<br/><br/>Still using the old printer, I disconnected the ethernet cable and connected the printer to the router with a USB cable.  Using the web interface to the ASUS router (192.168.1.1 by defaults), within 60 seconds I saw Brother HL5250DN appear as a USB 2,0 connected device on the router.<br/><br/>Because I already had the Windows 10 driver installed for using this printer on an Ethernet port, all I had to do was add a new TCP/IP port to the router for the USB connection following these breadcrumbs:<br/><br/>Settings &gt; Devices &gt; Printers &amp; Scanners &gt; Brother HL-5250DN &gt; Manage &gt; Printer Properties &gt; Ports &gt; Add Port... &gt; Standard TCP/IP Port - New Port... &gt;<br/><br/>The Add Standard TCP/IP Port Wizard will appear.<br/><br/>Click Next<br/>Enter your router IP address, usually 192.168.1.1 in both the "Printer Name and IP Address" and the "Port Name" text boxes.  If you already have a port named 192.168.1.1, Windows will change the name to 192.168.1.1_1 automatically.<br/><br/>Windows will then try to detect that port for about a minute, then show a screen "Additional port information required".  Select Custom &gt; Settings to see the Port Settings dialog.<br/><br/>Change protocol from Raw to LPR<br/>Under LPR Settings enter a "Queue Name" such as LPRServer1<br/>Click Ok &gt; Next &gt; Finish and the new port will be shown in the ports list and selected for use by the existing Printer driver.<br/><br/>When I got the new Brother HL-L2300D, I used these breadcrumbs to install it on the desktop and laptop:<br/>Settings &gt; Devices &gt; Printers &amp; Scanners &gt; My printer isn't listed &gt; Add a local printer or network printer with manual settings.<br/><br/>I followed all the screens in the wizards to install the new printer.<br/><br/>On the desktop, when I reached the point to define the port, I just selected the 192.168.1.1 that I had set up above.<br/><br/>On the laptop, when I reached the point to define the port, I followed the same steps as above to add the new port 192.168.1.1<br/><br/>On both the desktop and the laptop, when the Wizard asks you to select the driver you want, the Brother HL-L2300D will probably not be on the list.  Click the Windows Update button on that list page and Windows will download all the printer names for all printers for which Windows 10 provides drivers.<br/><br/>Hope this is helpful.</span>

<span>When my ancient HP1005 laser printer finally died, I quickly bought a Canon-MF3010 as a replacement. Bad choice: no way to duplex print, even manually. Sent it back, got the Brother L2300D for about $20 more and got automatic duplex. Everything else about the printer is as advertised, including great print quality. It's a tad noisy (compared to the HP), and the 5-second delay before the first sheet prints is scary at first (I guess that's to warm up the toner?), but it's an excellent printer overall. (The pages don't seem to curl, either.) Great buy, too!</span>

<span>The Brother HL-L2300d is a great little laser printer. Easy to set up and maintain without headaches. I am quite particular about what I buy and use. I read through all the reviews and the FAQs before I decided to go with this printer. First of all, this printer has been out for a few years so it has stood the test of time. This printer allows you to reset the count (or clicks) on the toner cartridge and drum so you can get all the life out of these items. It is easy to set up and get running. The printer doesn't come with a USB printer cable, so just buy one at the same time or most people would have one on hand. To reduce possible problems, use a printer cable that is only 6 ft. or shorter. Problems arise when using long cords with serial data transmissions...just believe me on this.<br/>  This printer does not allow WiFi. Please understand that most problems that I see people having are with the WiFi connections. Listen to me when I tell you that WiFi, printers, sleep modes, dynamic DNS and overcrowding on WiFi routers do not always go together. Most WiFi printer setups are not ready yet for the typical consumer. It might work for a while, but throw the sleep mode into the mix and then you're in a pickle. It is so much easier to just use a USB printer cable. You may even thank me later.<br/>  I have Windows 10 and it was easy to install. The Brother support website does a good deal of providing directions and problems solving. There is one part that might throw you off so I will take the time to give you easy directions for Windows 10. Get your printer all ready according to the quick help guide (i.e. remove the packing materials and install the toner cartridge, load paper, install power cord and connect USB printer cable to the printer only). DO NOT turn on the printer or connect the USB cable to your computer yet. DO NOT use the installation CD/DVD that comes with the printer. Go to support.brother.com on the ol' interweb. Do a search on "HL-L2300D". It doesn't need to be in caps, but I did that for clarity. Click on downloads and the website automatically determines what OS version you have installed. At this point say, "How cool is 'dat!" in the same manner as the Crazy Russian Hacker. Start downloading the FULL DRIVER &amp; SOFTWARE PACKAGE. The software will start downloading and then will pause. This is when you plug the USB cable into your computer and turn the printer on. The software will continue to load and install your printer.<br/>  Now if you did like me, I got too antsy and plugged in my USB cable and turned on my printer before partially installing the software/drivers from the Brother website. This installed a built-in driver which only supports the basic functions of the Brother machine. You just need to back up the process. Have your printer on and connected via USB cable. Go to support.brother.com just as you would in the previous paragraph. Go to the download section and halfway down the page you see a UTILITIES section. Run this uninstall tool to get rid of this basic driver. Now unplug the USB cable from the computer and turn off your printer. Go back to the previous paragraph and get it done right this time.<br/>  Always use good quality paper especially when printing in duplex to reduce the risk of jams. I picked up some HP Office20 (20#) but am not really impressed by it. It works well but seems a little too translucent. Using slightly heavier (24#) and a better brand will easily fix that. I hope this review helps someone. Please take the time to read all the FAQs, sort through the good/bad reviews before and scour the specifications on the manufacturers' websites before making purchases. It will solve most of the problems people encounter.</span>

<span>I have installed several of these, but this one was difficult to get all the correct drivers and get it up and running, however, I finally got a phone number for a live person to help. He logged into my computer and installed the correct drivers. I mainly print from AutoCAD or from PDF on size C and D architectural paper. The Tech got me up and running in 2 phone visits (about a week).  So, I'm happy. Had I been swamped, this would have been very inconvenient, however, I had the number and could have called back later in the same day, so I'm sure we could have solved it in 24 hours.  It prints nicely.  The paper catching bag makes the paper really roll up (especially the smaller the fresh roll gets).  I synched up the cloth basket that catches the paper with binder clips to make it less deep and that seems to keep the pages laying more flat so they don't get smashed down by newer prints. You will have to babysit your prints if you have lots to print. (would be nice if they would just stack flat, but I suppose that version of the machine costs a lot more. It would also be nice if you could use a 300' roll of paper, a 150' roll only does one print order (size D) or 2 print orders (size C) of blueprints.  So, you can't just leave when it's printing, which is a bummer, but alas, it is what it is.</span>

<span>This model replaced a 15 year old HP photosmart. While it prints just as well as the Photosmart, it doesn’t feel sturdily built. It also doesn’t have a USB port, or slots for SD or Micro SD cards. I had to buy a printer cable with a USB connection so I can add a hub with ports and slots for external storage. This is a major shortcoming of this printer.<br/>I forgot to mention that with the photosmart you could buy oem printer ink cartridges for under $20 for three black, a photo black and the three color cartridges. Check out the price for ink cartridges for this new printer. I’ve printer perhaps 50 blk pages and I’m practically out of blk ink. HP attempts to hook you into a printer cartridge contract. Also, I purchased a cable to hook up a hub so I can copy to a flash drive or a sd card. Couldn’t get it to work. I contacted their tech people. They said only option is to download to a pc, then connect a flash drive or did card to your pc and then save. Really!<br/>Don’t buy this printer. HP has really gone down hill.</span>

<span>1. I just received the printer yesterday to replace an HP4630 that died  after 5/ 6 years. This printer is much larger/clunkier looking.<br/>2. I did follow the setup steps &amp; immediately ran into problems using the  recommended app.  It would not make the connection with my Wi-Fi / my android phone (which is a current model).<br/>Luckily, I remembered a review that had mentioned something about a "Wizard" on the touchscreen on the printer that I could find by scrolling with my finger.  My previous HP printer had a wizard set up on it's touch screen but was easier to navigate than this one.<br/>This one was not easy to do, it did not want to easily scroll down but eventually I did finally get it &amp; after that it was quick to complete synch w/my wifi/android phone.<br/>3. I do not understand why HP does NOT tell you up front that you can use this wizard to set up with wireless/connect with your Wi-Fi ect. &amp; you do not need to use the app. to complete setup.<br/>I immediately uninstalled the app.<br/>I suppose they want you to have the app/create acct. so that you can use their ink products system.<br/>4. You do need app for  scanning, unfortunately.<br/>They probably also track other things. Who knows?<br/> 5. I did print a few documents from my phone, it worked fine for my purposes.<br/> I only use the printer perhaps 1/2× time a month/no more than 20 pages on average.<br/>UPDATE:  I have now used the printer for a couple of weeks and I am very surprised at how fast the printing is + no issues..The only reason I'm keeping the score I originally gave is because of the original setup issues.. Would recommend this printer for home/personal use</span>

<span>The box it arrived in was very tight (no shifting parts). The printer was easy to set up and connect either wirelessly or hard wired.  Probably the best one I have bought for my wife for her school’s projects.</span>

<span>I do love this printer. It prints fast, the touch screen is nice, has unique features, it prints from your phone, great quality, etc. A couple of things that bother me— not enough to send it back but just enough to want to warn people. It does not have a spot to hold papers that you’ve printed. So unless you’re standing in front of it ready to catch the paper, your prints will fall on the floor. SUPER annoying. Second, the ink doesn’t last for that long. It’s not horrible but it’s a shorter lifespan per cartridge than I’m used to. Lastly, the paper tray does not fit much paper. I like to shove as much paper as I can at once so that I don’t have to do it for a while. But this paper tray holds about 50 pages max. Again, these are little annoyances that mean a lot to me. Overall satisfied with it for it’s price but just be warned if these thing would really bother you.</span>
