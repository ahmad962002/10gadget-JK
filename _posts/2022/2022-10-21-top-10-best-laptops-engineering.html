<span>Bought this for work to replace my MacBook and I love it. I have a custom built PC, so I don’t use it for gaming. But the Ryzen handles my workload and 10 hour work days like a beast. The only downside is the battery life isn’t the best as compared to competitors. The track pads feels cheap (just use a mouse) and the screen does wobble when hit. Still would recommend over most MacBooks.</span>

<span>Upon receiving the laptop I booted it up and within 2 minutes it froze. Thinking it was a fluke I rebooted the machine and it froze up again. I've managed to reinstall windows, update drivers and nothing. This thing freezes within 2 to 5 minutes of startup if you're lucky. sometimes i can't even get past the login screen. HP has offered little to no help for a machine that is essentially bricked out of the box.</span>

<span>I spent several days migrating my apps and data from a dying Dell laptop (SSD failing) using a USB mouse (because it is easier to deal with for complex screen picks than a touchpad).  It was only then that I found that the touchpad was non-functional. Even when booted into BIOS the  touchpad diagnostics would not function. Thanks HP (NOT) for selling me a lemon. Works well otherwise.</span>

<span>I was installing Discord, steam, some other non-game related applications TWO at a time and it was overheating the left side of my laptop HARD. I haven't even tried a game or several chrome tabs yet. This was all AFTER I updated Windows and Nvidia.<br/><br/>Now we get to the gaming. Testing it with Baldur's Gate 3 and it automatically set it to ULTRA settings, minus DLSS, etc. The game is BEAUTIFUL (kinda running better than my gaming Desktop actually lol). But... just sitting at the main menu is 66 Celsius. (150F). CPU and GPU are pretty equivalent but CPU goes between 50-75C. You'd think that's fine, right? Well I had to use the loud as heck fan (Performance Mode) or it would hit 80C. Sitting at a somewhat avg of 71F in the tutorial area in the game and my keyboard is super warm to the touch. Especially the center. I am also kind of concerned for airflow since the bottom of the case is just... well let's just say bugs can get inside, or toothpicks, etc. No airflow... There is no proper covering for this. The 78C pic is when normal fan is going. 72 when Performance fan is going. This isn't even the big open world area in this game yet. If they fix the heating issue, honestly it's a 5 out of 5 stars. I think i'm going to need a cooling pad... As I am typing this, the center keys are really, really warm now. I do not think it is 71C in the center area of the motherboard.</span>

<span>First Impressions after 3 hours of use:<br/>-144hz is a huge game changer. Been using a 60hz monitor with my old PC for 4 years.<br/>-Screen is great. If 1920x1080 does not appear, launch Nvidia Control Panel if not setup before.<br/>-Keyboard is nice, with the ability to change the lights with Mystic Lights for MSI<br/>-Easy to setup. Geoforce experience didn't work with the drivers, but by downloading from online I was able to get them updated and update it to appear in Geoforce Experience.<br/>-Haven't tested battery, but bought to use plugged to not move very much.<br/><br/>Overall really happy.</span>

<span>Using it for 3 months now, it is a solid laptop and punches way above its weight class for price to performance. The 3070 (graphics card) is undervolted. But what do you expect in a laptop? It still plays 1080p games really well and the display looks crisp. Not as great as a dedicated $400 monitor, but as far as laptops go, this is really good.<br/><br/>I haven't played a single game it doesn't do 1080 at high/max settings with at least 60 fps. Usually more.<br/><br/>Camera is good, internet is as fast as an ethernet cable. No complaints. Mine didn't ship with windows 11 which meant it needed a full day of installation to get it where I wanted it.<br/><br/>Battery is meh. But it's a gaming machine that draws a lot of power.</span>

<span>Oh man, this MSI Nvidia 3070 Gaming Laptop is exhilarating. I have the capability to run Ultra graphics/ RTX graphics and 144hz. The storage is a bit small for my liking, I plan to soon upgrade my storage and RAM capacity. The CPU, Core i7 11th Gen, is a beast. I purchased the “Used “Like New,” so I obtained this at an affordable price ($1.2k). 2weeks in, I am experiencing no issues. Win 10 can easily be changed to Win 11 for free. The MSI Center application is very resourceful, that’s where you can change the keyboard color and configure/monitor other goodie’s.<br/><br/>Overall, if you’re looking for a gaming laptop that’s very powerful and has a decent price tag, I 100% recommended this rig.</span>

<span>Day one, and the Ideapad 3 started right up. I'm going to let it charge for a while before I complete the setup. One star deducted for no English setup instructions in the box.<br/><br/>Day 3. Just discovered it isn't a touch screen. No biggie, I hate touch screens anyway. I'm using a small wireless mouse, and it works fine. I'm not sure how much internal memory this unit has, but I just stuck a 64 gb sd card in it so that'll be fine.<br/><br/>I bought this for a specific meeting - to see if I could drive a presentation on a large screen tv without having to bring a full featured laptop or tablet and to see if I'd like a Chromebook better than a tablet. Today, I hooked this little Lenovo Chromebook up to a big screen via the usb c port and it works fine. Had to buy the special cable with the HDMI on the other end but it was inexpensive and it came the next day from Amazon. What I really like about this little gem (if it continues to work...) is that it has regular usb ports as well - 2 of them! My Lenovo M10 tablet has none and thus there's no way to input or output data via cable. This is proving to be an interesting experiment.</span>

<span>Chromebooks have a life cycle of 8 years - this one was made in 2020, so it has about 6 or so years of support left. I didn't care and all I wanted was something small and light so I could write on my bed. I don't mind that it's a chromebook - in fact, this is my first chromebook and I'm in love. I'm planning to get another one for Black Friday if the price is good enough, because I love this one so much (I[m planning to have an indoor chromebook and an outdoor chromebook). The screen is a bit iffy, but it's good enough. I use this one more than I do my $700 tablet. I don't do anything heavy with it, so this is perfect for my needs.</span>

<span>this baby can really perform (for limited tasks only)  notice the 64G storage....its small !  The keyboard functionality is good, chip is decent and the startup quick.  got the screen looking best possible (again decent).  At this price point it's great for those needing Windows OS (like me).  Use it as a work at home back up to my I Mac that handles the brunt of my needs.  Don't know if the free Windows is worth loading I've cut everything I can and have only 25.2G remaining storage (and don't plan on adding anything unless absolutely necessary).

<span>I needed to replace my previous laptop after 5+ years, but I didn't want to break the bank. After researching different gaming laptops, the Acer Nitro 5 stood out as the best balance between price and performance.<br/><br/>I was nervous about upgrading to Windows 11 (I'd avoided upgrading from Windows 7 to 8 because of the terrible UI), but it's actually very clean and minimalist.<br/><br/>The Nitro 5's performance has blown my expectations out of the water. My previous laptop could barely scrape by the FFXIV benchmark on "normal laptop" settings, but the Nitro 5 scored very high on the "high desktop" settings. I've signed up for PC Game Pass to take advantage of my new hardware power, and it's been amazing playing Microsoft Flight Simulator on high settings.<br/><br/>I did end up buying an extra 8GB Crucial RAM, and installing that was a breeze.<br/><br/>Fantastic value for the price!</span>

<span>I spent a while deciding on a lower end gaming machine to get after growing weary of PSN offerings over the last few years. Have been a console player on PSN for 27 years and wanted a good machine to start my PC adventures again. For PC Gaming you have to have good gear. And man can this machine deliver! It boots up and shuts down in about 5-7 seconds and flys through games and apps. I'm running Xbox live, Steam, Epic games with no issues.<br/><br/>The keyboard is nice, one of the reasons I picked this machine, very comfortable to use hours on end. Fans are loud, as most of these gaming machines are, but really not too bad...I don't ever really notice them while I'm playing. I run my HDMI out to a 4K gaming monitor and it runs great. Some people complain about the touch pad, but I never use it....using the Nitro gaming mouse and love it. I like the thin bezel screen design, keeping those red LED's on my keyboard. Some gaming laptops do not have a good keyboard layout...this one is nice.<br/><br/>I also can confirm this works with Meta Quest 2 with a link cable (to a decent degree). Some low end gaming laptops do not even have a USB 3.0 port, this one does. Don't expect this machine to work great on all VR games and it takes a bit of tweaking to get your system running smooth, I did have some issues with a couple Steam VR games. But I can confirm it works reasonably well with VR Pokerstars and PopOne is playable (I still prefer wireless for that as there is not a real advantage in using link cable, but it was a great test on framerate and playability). I will be trying more VR games eventually. You do have to optimize this laptop a bit but not too much to do , trim down the fat. But it is fun exploring what this machine can do with VR games.<br/><br/>Some tips:<br/>I HIGHLY recommend getting another Ram stick, 16Gig min. (I'm running 16 Gig and always have 4-8 Gigs free) . At 8 Gigs it's just not enough.  I also highly recommend getting a larger SSD card (just add on) as these games do take up space quickly. I dropped in a 1 TB card so I am at 1.2 TB now. Taking the back cover off was not really too hard, once you take the screws off and pop off the first latch, just be careful as this case is plastic.<br/><br/>I use an adjustable metal laptop stand and have the back raised 3 or 4 inches to keep the air flow underneath good (lowered down a bit) , after a couple months of use it seems to work well and gives me a comfortable angle to use the keyboard.</span>

<span>I've only had this for a day now, so I can't speak to longevity. All in all I'm pleased with this laptop. It's lightweight but packs a punch still. Set up and updating was quick and easy. It's a great utilization of space, only a slim border around the screen and keyboard.<br/><br/>A few first impression negatives: you can see in other review images that it comes with 5 semi permanent stickers, (Nvidia, Intel, Alexa, 144hz, and a long feature banner). That was a bummer because they weren't in the product image, and they look awful (not to mention some were crooked). Thankfully they're removable, though I had to use glass cleaner to get rid of residue from one. Not a big deal though. The frame is very lightweight and flexible. The feet keep it raised which is good for cooling, but any pressure on the middle makes it flex, which I don't love. It's not going to crumble, but it's definitely a step down from my Lenovo with a metal body. You're paying for the internal components, not the frame.</span>

<span>The i7 just gets way too hot. So hot that it quickly throttles CPU performance to less than the i5 model. The screen is decent quality and I love the form-factor but I ended up returning and purchasing an i5 model that stays snappy and much cooler than the i7 counterpart.</span>

<span>I was looking to replace my Dell XPS 13 laptop I purchased 5 years ago. Great little computer, but aging and slow. Also, all of a sudden the screen felt tiny...(my aging eyes).<br/>Since we travel frequently, my goal was to find a light device yet with a big enough screen to be able to read.<br/>I came across the LG Gram portfolio and was impressed with the 16:10 ratio display. To my surprise, the 16-inch model I purchased was lighter than my 13-inch old machine. A good start!<br/>After reading and viewing numerous reviews I purchased the 16Z90P-K.AAB7U1. I selected a device with only 256GB RAM memory to save money, knowing that it has a Micro SD reader. For $28 I bought a fast compatible MicroSD 256GB card, thus doubling the memory capacity to 512GB.<br/>Overall it's fast, bright and as importantly very light. The only minor criticism I have is that it smudges on the cover easily when you handle it. Small issue to deal with in comparison to the many benefits and value.</span>

<span>Not gonna lie, super impressed with this laptop. Was considering an HP Spectre or Galaxy Book Pro, but stumbled across this on here of all places. It had everything i was looking for &amp; more than what I even realized.<br/><br/>Presentation in box was nice. Like how it is packaged in a dust sleeve &amp; even has a dust sleeve in-between screen &amp; keyboard. Major plus mark for that alone.<br/><br/>Upon booting first time &amp; getting initially set up, enjoyed how nice the screen is. IPS is the way to go, ngl. Keyboard light &amp; RGB options are a major upgrade for my use. Selection of apps &amp; programs from the get go are too numerous to mention, but is nice to have plenty of options. After removing what didn't interest me, proceeded with updates, as you should with any device.<br/><br/>This thing seems like Sonic... GOTTA GO FAST!<br/><br/>Dragon Center App has tons of various tweaks &amp; options for things like Keyboard RGB light, Power/ Battery, Performance, etc. Definite plus for that alone. Some people can't stand it, so I'll leave that up to particular preference.<br/><br/>Yes, the fans can he EXTREMELY NOISY... BUT for my particular usage &amp; wants in a laptop, quite a fair trade off. Only way they get THAT noisy, is if you select extreme performance/ cooler boost. A good pair of headphones would drown that noise.<br/><br/>Another surprise, is that you can run android games either through The appropriate MSI app or even Bluestacks... was not aware of when I decided to purchase, but cool nonetheless. I would say remove the MSI App Player &amp; just use true Bluestacks, if you want to mess with Amdroid emulation<br/><br/>With this, I plan on investing in Steam, finally. Not to mention, can't wait to see what this thing can handle, emulation-wise (Can't wait to try Stepmania on this). [Edit/ Update 9/7/21 -Stepmania runs just like arcade Dance Dance Revolution on MAX graphical program settings. Just a little side note, SOME games that have a max refresh rate of 60hz may have graphical issues... I'm specifically mentioning Sonic Adventure &amp; Adcenture 2 for PC being OVERLY FAST. There are workarounds to get said games working perfectly.]<br/><br/>Build seems solid. Got the Gray version &amp; am not disappointed at all by my choice. It has a nice blue tinit to it.<br/><br/>[Update 9/7/21- Dont expect to get a ton of battery use out of this thing. Setting battery saver settings via windows &amp; dragon center to as max as possible &amp; lowering screen brightness might get 6 to 8 hours of battery life, with just normal, no gaming computer use. Thankfully you can calibrate battery when needed to extend the service life of it.] [Another note: if you run demanding thinga in this, it will get hot to hold. My suggestion, buy a GOOD laptop stand with fan cooling. I would suggedt KLIM Ultimate RGB for if you are a gamer that plays less demaning games. Binding of Isaac, Emulation, etc. Said cooler would probably be good for some demanding games too, with Cooler Boost function turned on to help get some extra airflow]<br/><br/>This may be The best "budget" gaming laptop out there atm. Got the 512 GB Model with 16 GB ram &amp; the RTX 3060. Going to eventually go overkill with max ram &amp; a 2 tb Samsung SSD. Can't wait to see what this thing can unleash then... but for now, happy camper!</span>

<span>I love MSI, I really do, but as many know, MSI isn't the best, but it works beautifully. At first I kept running into a blue screen, but after updating all the drives, it works great, just got to keep it up to date or you will get a blue screen and your computer will restart. The anti glare screen was the very first thing I notices. The main down fall with this computer is the battery. It is absolutely horrible. The fans are a little loud, but they work okay. I did notice that my computer likes to over heat, but with the boost cool on the MSI Drangon Application on the PC, it will cool your laptop quickly, just don't forget to turn it off lol. But over all, a great piece of equipment, and can't wait to see what else MSI has to offer</span>

The setup is really quick and easy and I could basically start using it after 10 minutes after starting it for the first time.<br/><br/>However, the trackpad was really hard to get used to. Not only did it have a really unsatisfying click it kept moving around. It's just poor quality. For some reason, the trackpad would move a little bit when I tapped the trackpad instead of clicking. This really annoyed me because it just made the trackpad feel super flimsy.<br/><br/>Also for some reason opening the laptop is really hard. There's not much of a groove to put your finger in which makes opening the laptop difficult. Also, the pads on the bottom of the laptop don't offer grip at all. So instead of opening the laptop, I would just end up pushing the laptop around.<br/><br/>The biggest deal breaker for me was the fact the computer got so hot. I didn't even play games on it yet though I'm sure it could handle it. I can't even have the laptop sit on my lap. It would basically burn me. I was in a discord call in bed with some friends I was sweating so much just because the laptop was so hot. I don't know why it would heat up like that for something so simple.<br/><br/>Overall I think if you don't need to actually use this as a laptop most of the time it's okay. But if you need something for school or work where it's necessary to carry it around from place to place look somewhere else.</span>
