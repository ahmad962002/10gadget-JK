<span>I struggled to get this open for the longest time.  I cut along the opening with a sharp blade and tried<br/>to extract the cover in every way.  Finally I got it open.  Now I am having to pull out the roll, reach in<br/>for the towelette and rethread it thru the top each time.<br/><br/>This is my second purchase of this item and I REALLY LOVE THEM once I get the out.  I don't recall having<br/>such a struggle with the first purchase.  Maybe this one was a fluke.<br/><br/>Add on comment:  fortunately, I had saved the old canister, so I put the new roll in their plastic wrap into<br/>the old canister which opened and shut easily.  I find it is easier to open the canister and pull out each cloth rather than using the threader.<br/><br/>I will reorder once more and hope that the top isn't cemented on.  😉</span>

<span>I bought these to wipe down all my student laptops at the end of the year and to clean all my classroom electronics. This stuff works and cleans well. First off, kids are disgusting when it comes to caring for school laptops. The grime and filth that came off their laptops when I was done would make a person with even the strongest constitution toss their cookies! Petri dishes of germs! These work great and and are specially made to be used on electronics. I actually had some colleagues say they were going to Clorox wipe the laptops. I'm so happy I convinced and informed them that would be a major problem. Yay for electronic wipes. Nay for kiddos who use grubby hands on their laptops!!!</span>

<span>Did the job. I’m not upset with it. However it took some scary pressure on my screen to clean some spots. What makes very little sense as no one has touched the screen. It was normal every day dusk buildup. So scrubbing scratching and pressure on a soft screen was unnerving as I’ve not a penny to replace the telly. However the screen is very clean.

These anti-static cleaning wipes are lightly moistened for maximum control over dust and smudges. For advanced streak removal please pair with Endues for Electronics Microfiber Towels, sold separately! This pack includes 70 wipes per canister, and is especially formulated to safely clean electronic devices. Just one wipe is perfect for any smaller electronic surface you are looking to clean. Perfect for fragile tablet equipment, remotes, controllers, towers, console, gamer devices, radios, and backs of televisions TV are great for these wipes. If cleaning one small handheld device such as a remote, you may need to remove excess moisture to avoid streaks. Please read packaging for more information. Larger surfaces such as full VR equipment are great, but require extra wipes depending on the size and debris. People who wear foundation or powder love that it removes the debris and skin oil smudges on their portable devices. These are great surface cleaning wipes. The debris cling to the fabric on the wipe, rather than leave excess debris once your device dries. There is no pilling from the actual wipes. Pair with our screen cleaning wipes, and our microfiber towels for amazing results.

<span>Been using this stuff for a couple years now and it's better than anything I've ever used. Better than Invisible Glass. Used to be able to get it at Best Buy all day long but I guess they are selling their own brand (Dynex) stuff now -- not sure if that is re-branded Screen Dr. Pro or not -- so I opted to buy it here.<br/><br/>I was initially a little concerned that these particular large 9oz. bottles of product I received were either old or messed up in some way as the product is milky white, not the usual mostly-clear-translucent looking stuff I'd been used to. Product smells fine and works great, so I dunno...maybe it's older or newer but it doesn't seem to affect its expected performance at all. This is a hot commodity in my house with the wife and kids and all our combined gadgetry.<br/><br/>Streak free shine is possible after cleaning off your device, then using another microfiber towel to gently "buff" any remaining product. If it still doesn't look streak free, your cloth is probably to blame, or you applied it to a device that was too warm (and the product evaporated faster than you could gently buff it). The included microfiber cloth isn't too large and will get likely pretty filthy fairly quickly. Just use a drop of dish soap on it (Palmolive in my case) and wring under warm running water until the soap is gone and then let it air dry -- good as new (do NOT wash microfiber in the washing machine unless you use a conditioner-free/softener-free detergent).<br/><br/>Let your inner OCD out to play with this stuff -- I keep a little bottle in my backpack for when I'm traveling. ;)</span>

<span>We are living in a scary world, a world that is  heading back towards a time with increased infection from antibiotic resistant organisms. We have had the luxury of living in a time with Sir Alexander Fleming’s discovery of penicillin in 1928. Is it not amazing that we have had the use of medical antibiotics for less than 100 years? In that time, we have experienced improved lifespan, decreased infection rates and an explosion in medications and cleaning chemicals. Let us be honest, there is an entire isle of cleaning supplies at Walmart and other Grocery/hardware stores. This is a multi-billion dollar per year industry. There are wipes, sprays, scrubs and various methods of cleaning the world around you. Do you have children? If you answered yes, your world cannot be clean, it is impossible. I love my 3 children, but they are disease factories.<br/><br/>“Daddy, can I play on your phone,” says Daniel (7 yr old)? “Mommy can I play on yours,” says Samuel (4 year old)? Those of you with children are aware of the babysitter, the smart device. We clean our homes, we vacuum, we spray anti-microbial agents on surfaces to attempt to kill all manner of microbes. However, there is one surface that we often fail to clean, our smart devices.<br/><br/>While perusing CES 2016, I was introduced to Allsop Inc. This company has delivered innovative tech accessory products (computer, mobile devices in the home and office, fitness and decorative solar lighting) across multiple industries, for the past 50 years. While evaluating the many offerings of the booth, I noted a product called Screen Dr. Professional. The company has a variety of sizes for their Screen Dr. Line (2oz, 5oz, 9oz). The chemical is noted to be alcohol free, ammonia free, streak free and is anti microbial. Yes that is correct, antimicrobial. This was posted on the front of their packaging and I found this disgusting: “Did you know? Phones are Often Dirtier than Toilet Seats.”<br/>The packaging is a simple blister pack with cardboard backing. You can easily see the product and it describes the capabilities very well. The product I received is the 2 oz bottle (Airline friendly size). The Screen Dr. product is easily removed from the packaging, simply peel up the cardboard and remove the product. I find this easier than the hinged plastic type blister packs with sharp edges. Those are often difficult to open, without destroying everything on the inside. Removing the plastic lid, you are left with three separate pieces: bottle, lid and 6 inch cleaning cloth. The cloth neatly drapes over the bottle and slides back into the lid, for convenient storage. Who has not lost multiple cleaning cloths? The lid is also designed with a vent, allowing the cloth to dry. This ensures that it is dry the next time you need to clean your screen.<br/><br/>When you do remove the outer plastic lid, the microfiber cloth will likely be nested inside the lid. Slide a finger into the lid and gently remove the cloth. Remove the small plastic cap overlying the spray head. Spray the cloth with a mist of the solution. DO NOT SPRAY YOUR DEVICE! Use the cloth to wipe the screen, sides and back of your device. The instructions recommend to clean a cool screen, to reduce streaking. I have had no issues using this on my iPhone 6s Plus (inside of a catalyst waterproof case) and my iPad Air2 (inside of Otterbox defender) before use, during use or after use. This did not cause streaking. I have tried lens cloths alone, water,  gentle wet wipes and I have never been satisfied with the way the screen looks. I really hate streaks. Do not use other chemicals/cleaners as they may have products that damage the coating on your devices/screen. Do not use wood based products as they are essentially fine sandpaper. The ScreenDr. formulation is safe for any device.<br/>This works incredibly well. I am really happy with the cleanliness of my screens. Plus, it has the added bonus of reducing bacterial load and reducing future growth/return of bacteria. I do not have any way to test this claim about sanitation, however. I just have to trust hand washing and that their claim is true. If all it does is make my screen shiny and fingerprint free, it is worth it. If it truly reduces bacterial presence, it surpasses even the 5/5 star rating. It is convenient that it is an all in 1 system. The 2 oz bottle is airline friendly, and should fit into the standard quart sized ziplock bag. This would be a wonderful gift for the techie in your life.</span>

<span>Amazing for cleaning the screens or old mirrors, won’t leave streaks and spots like other brands, if you have big screen tv I will recommend bigger microfiber cloth, the turtle wax brand has the one for mirrors and omg it works magic</span>
