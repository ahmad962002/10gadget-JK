<span>Good for the price. Easy to install. Versatile mounts. Due to design wouldn't recommend for heavy and large projectors. I have a Epson 5040ub and I have to really wrench on the bolts to make sure they are snug enough to keep the tilt from moving positions.<br/><br/>Would buy again though.</span>

<span>Ordering a mount for what is presumably a pretty hefty investment like a projector is tough for me when I can lay hands on it first.  This is one of the lowest priced mounts- hundreds less than some- but it absolutely delivers.  After a week, my projector has not fallen from the ceiling!  I know that's not the standard, but this is an incredible value.<br/><br/>This comes with a huge array of different mounting pieces to accommodate nearly any projector; I'd go so far as to say the number of bolts, anchors, mounting arms and shock absorbers are almost overkill.  A wrench and hex key are included so you have the tools you need to assemble it- though, a screwdriver, hammerdrill, drill etc. may be needed depending on what type of surface you are mounting to.<br/><br/>It articulates on both axis, and tightening up after getting the angles right was easy enough.  Between your projectors settings and this dynamo mount, you can almost certainly get the right projection angle.  The hardest part was the fact that you mount part to the ceiling, then install a hook on the projector.  The hook-style hanging design was a little tricky when you are working in a tight space, such as up against a ceiling, but once you get the hooks on the bolts, it tightens easily and is very secure.<br/><br/>The downside to versatility is always more work for you- if you buy a proprietary, model specific mount it's a lot easier, but will cost you a heck of a lot more.  Finding the right combo of mounting arms to attach to the projector may take a try or two, but it wasn't overly cumbersome.  The instructions were clear and all the parts fit and worked, but that doesn't mean my heart wasn't racing when I finally let go.<br/><br/>For the value, sturdiness and versatility, it earns 5 stars and I'd absolutely but this again.</span>

<span> I needed to install a projector onto a drop ceiling in my basement.  I looked at multiple mounting systems and they were expensive,  had plastic parts or just wouldn’t  work with my needs.  This QualGear unit looked good and I knew I could make it work so I went ahead and purchased it.<br/><br/>I liked that the unit had some features that I appreciated:<br/>• It came with a lot of hardware so I would not have to go to the hardware store to purchase additional screws, nuts, bolts and other items.  It even included spare extension arms to fit multiple projector designs.  It includes spaces and washers and even large mounting screws for the mounting plate.  I show these items in my video.<br/>• It is designed to be a universal mount and sure enough it worked perfectly with my projector.  It is a BenQ HT3050.<br/>• The mounting unit is made of steel and it is ruggedly designed<br/>• It comes in white so it matched my ceiling and it matched my projector<br/>• It has four ways to adjust the mounting angles for the projector to make sure that it is aligned the way you need it to be.<br/>• I loved that it had a drilling templet in the box and I used it to design and build a mounting system that extended down from the basement ceiling joists to the level of the drop ceiling.<br/>• The mounting bracket is fairly priced, especially if you consider its quality and all of the supplied hardware that is supplied.<br/><br/>Overall I am very pleased with the unit as it worked perfectly and the installation is solid.  I put together a detailed video to show how the unit assembles and mounts to my projector.  I also show how finding the projector’s center of gravity is important.  My video shows the final installation and I think it looks very good.<br/><br/>I rated this mount at 5 stars and I would purchase it again.  I hope my video is helpful for you.  It has been almost 2 years and i have had not problems with this mount.  It is solid and it works well, just make sure you install it properly.<br/><br/>We have used this mount every day since we installed it and it is as solid as the day we installed it.<br/><br/>I am happy that I purchased it and the installation worked out perfectly.  This unit provides solid mounting and allows easy adjustment of the aiming setup.<br/><br/>This unit is well designed and flexible enough to fit multiple projectors.</span>

<span>I have an Epson 4010 mounted to the ceiling with this.<br/><br/>The good:<br/>Very adjustable, cheap, easy to install, fairly low profile.<br/><br/>The bad:<br/>Some of the adjustmenting screws are difficult to reach with the supplies wrench, It's not very sturdy- the weight of the 4010 at almost 25lbs is almost too much for it, it's difficult to lock in place even with the screws very tight.<br/><br/>I definitely suggest mounting the piece that attaches to the projector in the center so that the weight is balanced.  If you attach it unbalanced the mount is not sturdy enough to keep it in place.</span>

<span>I received the QualGear truss mounting kit and my first impressions were that it is very well constructed and sturdy. It is made to mount to any truss and fits most projectors on the market. Since my projectors are mounted over people, I want to make sure that the projectors are secure and there isn't any chance they will come crashing down on someone. At first I thought the price was a little high, but after researching other truss mounts, I found that this one is actually priced lower. I highly suggest this mount if you are using a truss.</span>

<span>I took the advice of others and installed this over my tile. It was very easy and looks great. I may use some white caulk around the edges and touch it up with some armstrong white paint, but overall, I'm very pleased. I like the option of not only being able to center it like I did, but using provided knockouts to install it 4" or 7" forward or backwards (depending on the orientation) if needed. The cable support provides some stabilization and comfort knowing that the projector will never fall to the ground.</span>

I called Amer the next day and I was immediately put through to someone.  He stated he would call me the next day regarding availability of longer projector mounting arms.  2 hours later he called and stated that the extension arms just finished production so they did not have an item number in order for me to buy them.  Since they were not able to sell them to me yet, they had  a set shipped directly to me from the manufacturing location in FL.  I received a FedEx package the next day with the extension arms and they fit perfectly, which helped keep me from needing to remove the suspended ceiling tile install and return the entire kit.  The responsiveness of this company was exceptional.  The product is all metal and very sturdy with plenty of ways to adjust the projector angle.<br/><br/>Great product and very responsive company.</span>

<span>This was by far one of the best investments we have made! We use drop ceiling and the actually ceiling is maybe about two feet higher than the drop ceiling so before we were using a long arm projector mount to go straight to the actually ceiling, but there would be a lot of shaking and the projection image would ‘unadjust’. I took the advice of another buyer and took the time to use my existing ceiling tile instead of just using the metal ceiling tile provided. Simply cut the outline of the arm, put the original drop ceiling and then the metal plate on top of the drop ceiling, and screw in the arm! It looks great and clean! Highly recommended, very sturdy and easy to use!</span>

<span>I am not very impressed with this. I mounted this on the back-wall with projector, projecting in the front. Problem is it has a very little margin of error. It tilts sideways and it tilts in U adjustment. It does not however tilt vertically. You would think that the most potential margin of error should be vertical considering your projector is mounted close to the ceiling. I am returning this back, unless someone tells me I am doing something wrong.<br/><br/>UPDATE:<br/>Ok, my bad. I was making the mistake of not finding the vertical shift knob, which was hidden behind the cap in the front. I also had a bad installer, that didn't help.<br/><br/>Upon correcting my mistake, I decided to change my rating to 5*. I really was impressed with the 3-tilt mode of this mount. You can tilt U, vertical and horizontal. This gives you a decent margin of error while installing the mount. I put it on the back-wall, but my assumption is that, it would be as perfect even if you installed on the ceiling. Amount of re-enforcement will also make sure it wouldn't loosen up with time.<br/><br/>One thing I did notice is that the installer wasn't able to use all the 4 screws to the projector. My feeling is it was a case of bad installer. I am going to undo it and make sure all the 4 screws are properly screwed to the projector.<br/><br/>A 5* product.</span>

This one fit the bill for us with about 6-6.5" to top of projector from top of projector mount wall bracket.  To make this even higher, we built up our wall above the suspended ceiling, placing the projector mount arm above the ceiling grid, getting a clean looking installation while also getting the projector just a few inches below the ceiling.  Installation was straight forward, unit is sturdy and seems to be reliable. Adjustments were precise, and overall we are pleased with the product.</span>

"This unique stand includes two universal holders: one for your pico projector and the other for your phone. Alternatively, it may also be used with two phones for videos, tutorials, or live stream video. PRIMARY USE: Pico Projectors (sold separately by third-party sellers ) are commonly used in the cookie decorating community. Unfortunately, the stands that come with them are usually too short, and are very flimsy. Arkon's Cookie Decorators Mount is different. It's a stand that is height-adjustable up to 43"" tall, allowing you to position your projector at the perfect height every time you use it. Many cookie decorators want to use a pico projector and also be able to use their mobile phone to record cookie decorating videos. This functionality is easy with the Cookie Decorators Mount. Insert your phone into the holder clamped onto the pole/post of the stand and tilt it downward to capture the action. For most pico projectors, the phone holder on the top arm assembly is the best way to grip your projector (those less than 3.9"" wide). However, the Cookie Decorators Mount also includes a camera adapter with standard 1/4""-20 threaded pattern, which is found on all pico projectors, digital video recorders, and cameras. SECONDARY USE: If you own two phones, you can be filming front-facing or overhead view videos with the phone holder on the top arm assembly. If in the overhead view position, you'll be able to use your phone mounted to the pole/shaft position to view the comments or your hand movements in a Facebook or Instagram live. Using two phones is also a great way to capture more than one camera angle for your videos. Both phone holders securely fit phones up to 3.9” wide, including Apple iPhone 11 Pro Max, iPhone 11 Pro, iPhone 11, iPhone XS Max, iPhone XS, iPhone XR, iPhone X, Samsung Galaxy Note 20 and Note 10, Galaxy S20, S10, and S9, and LG G6, G5, and G4."

My only real complaint (thought it really shouldn't be a complaint) is that the expanding jaws on two of the mounts do not open wide enough for many micro projectors I looked at, which was a bit concerning til I saw this also comes with a standard camera screw type mounting option. My wife loves it and uses it heavily. She's even used the second mount to create some videos of her working on the cookies for social media which has been extra helpful.</span>

The legs could be a tad longer for a little more stability, but they seem well-proportioned to the top.  The top is plastic, but I don't have a problem with that.  However, the measurements for the top include the lip on the side that prevents your items from falling off.  As a result, the MacBook Pro that I thought would fit in fact rests on top of the ridge, and slides right off the top with practically zero resistance.  Unfortunately the larger side is very significantly larger, so I'm keeping this smaller version and have ordered a set of 5mm x 2" round rubber pads to attach to the base.  The MacBook won't fit inside the lip, but at least the rubber pads will help hold it in place.<br/><br/>If they increased the size of this surface by just one inch in width, and provided a rubber surface vs the hard plastic, it would be a winner all the way around!<br/><br/>I plan on using this for my laptop when I'm out in the field with the telescope.</span>

The Universal Projector Mount sets itself apart from other industrial looking ceiling mounts. Styled from steel and die-cast aluminum, the mounts boast a clean and simple finished appearance when viewing it on the ceiling. The CGUPM06 extends approximately 12 inches from the ceiling, rotates, tilts and swivels in virtually any direction, and is capable of functioning on flat or vaulted ceilings. The Universal Projector Mount is compatible with most of today�s LCD and DLP home theater projectors and is fully adjustable to fit a wide range of projector hole patterns.

<span>#1  Unless you are used to doing this kind of stuff, I'd recommend doing this in stages.  The last thing you want to have happen is your hand/arm to start to get sore when you're in a precious part of the install where you really can't stop!<br/><br/>First off, the manual said to predrill 5/32 holes 2 inches deep for the 3 bolts that screw into your wall stud.  Looking at the size of the bolts, and how deep they are, I just knew it wasn't even going to cut it.  And I was right.  5/32  was nowhere near a big enough of a pilot hole, and I doubt that even Hercules could screw those bolts into a wall stud with that small of a pilot hole.<br/><br/>I drilled into the holes again, and this time used a 1/4 inch drill.  Worked just fine, it was still really hard to screw in, but I was able to get it done.<br/><br/>The manual was really terrible considering that the mount (which was in an unopened box) was partially pre-assembled, but it was done incorrectly.  I thought I was missing a piece or something.  Looking at the photo on the bottom of the box made it apparent what I needed to do, and honestly at that point it was enough to get it finished.<br/><br/>I have a benq 2050a which this mount did work with, but I really wish I had gone with another mount that fits the benq better.  This mount clearly wants a projector that has much thicker mounting bolts than benq uses, and the workaround to make this mount work with a benq just doesn't seem to be that great.  We'll see if this thing falls off.  What's really funny is that the projector is mounted directly above my head.  If this thing does fall, it's going to hurt like a mother...<br/><br/>I'm not very smart I guess!<br/><br/>The main arm was just barely long enough to allow the power cord and hdmi cord to fit.  One of my hdmi cables had too robust of a strain relief so I had to use another, but it did work.<br/><br/>My main complaint is I can't quite get the image flush against the wall.  I need to be able to rotate it just a tad, but I don't see a way to do this.  It seems like the rotation is locked in by the two bolts that face you when you are looking directly at it, but I can't turn them to loosen them at this point.  It's really frustrating, because if I put just a slight amount of pressure on one side of the projector it becomes level, but then it rocks back into the slightly askew projected image.<br/><br/>I might have better luck getting those two bolts turned when I pick up a screwdriver that has allen heads on it...<br/><br/>But man, I wish I had just simply installed a shelf.  That would have been a lot easier.</span>

<span>This is a solid piece of equipment with some decent options for versatility. Arm flex symbols are used in the installation guide letting you know to tighten the bolts down snug. And I'll say this, of anything I've ever ordered off Amazon, this is by far the most rugged and durable. You can crank those bolts without worrying about snapping or stripping them, or breaking the equipment. Really nice job with the construction.<br/><br/>The versatility options are there, but they're somewhat limited which I'll explain in a minute. First, you don't need to use the extension arm. You can completely remove that middle piece and keep the setup more straightforward and compact.<br/><br/>However, I'm sure many people are getting this for the extension arm. All I can say is, I really wish the arm or the base connector socket (to the projector) had a swivel head.<br/><br/>As it stands, the arm only provides pivot points for adjustment. This isn't a big deal and will provide sufficient versatility for most people. Unfortunately, I need to be able to raise my projector about 1 inch higher and I can't with this mount. Even with the arm completely tilted up, if I extend the connection piece to the projector mount forward (rather than extended in the downward position), then my projector is now facing vertical and not horizontal. Without a swivel head, there's no way to angle the projector back to the horizontal position.<br/><br/>Overall, it's a decent, rugged projector mount. Unfortunately, it just can't meet the very specific height and position I need it to. Downfalls of getting a projector without a lense shift. Still recommend this for most other projector applications!</span>

<span>First, I used this with a Mitsubishi HC 1500 DLP projector, which is a great first projector (i got it in my initial foray into home projection), and which Amazon offers as a deal with this mount.  If you are thinking of going the front projector route, this is a good deal/pairing - all you need is a good-quality screen and a 5.1 system and you're ready to rock.  This mount works fantastic with the Mitsubishi HC1500 (which is a 3-screw upsidedown mounter) - i am extremely impressed with its steadiness, now that it's up on my wall and holding my projector.  As others have noted, the directions to this mount are pretty confusing/worthless, but after looking at the instructions, and the box, and some on-the-fly experimenting, i basically had the mount together (attached to the projector) in about 10-15 min.  Then maybe about another 15-20 min to get it up on the wall and do some fine-tuning of the joints and settings (i.e. centering/height, image invert, correcting keystone, etc).  The really good thing about this mount is that it can move in several directions, on several axes, so it's very versatile and will  work with either a ceiling or wall situation - just find a wall stud or a beam and you're in business.  I actually mounted the bracket on my wall, instead of my ceiling, due to the weird layout of my screening room.  The allen screws really hold firmly once you tighen them - this is a lightweight yet VERY solidly constructed mount.  Hats off to whoever engineered this thing.  Tip: when you install, it definitely helps to have 2 people, as fine-tuning the joints may require loosening more than one allen at a time, so someone may need to steady the projector as the other tightens the allen screws.  But it's a minor point - once this bracket is up, it's up to stay and there's no question in my mind i got the right mount.  Highest recommendation - it really helped me pull my screening room together in a quality way.</span>

<span>I needed a mount for my new BenQ TK850 projector and this mount turned out to be just what the doctor ordered.  As you can see by the photos, I have log beams running across the room.  I had hoped to hang the projector directly on the bottom of the beam but the required distance from the screen to the projector was just a few inches further back.  This Vantage Point mount allowed me to set the projector back from the screen just enough for what I needed.  Also, while you should measure carefully to make sure the center of the projector lens (not the projector body), lined up perfectly with the left-right center of the screen, this mount will allow for some minor left-right adjustment as well.<br/><br/>Before I purchased this mount, I noticed on the reviews that some customers had trouble figuring out how to assemble it.  No doubt about it, the enclosed assembly instructions are very basic, but if you study the picture of the mount on the box and compare it to the instructions, it should make sense.  I was worried also about whether the mount would lock down enough to keep it from sagging over time.  No worries because after you find the correct position, there is a "lock screw" with an Allen wrench head that you tighten down on the joint.  The Allen wrench and screw is included with the mount.<br/><br/>By the way, adjusting the position of the projector in the mount is pretty easy.  Just loosen bolt in the appropriate arm enough to allow for nudging projector into position then tighten down.  I was able to do it alone but another person could make adjustments a little easier.<br/>I've owned 3 previous projectors with 3 different mounts.  The Vantage Point mount has been the easiest and less costly to install.  I am very pleased with the mount and the BenQ TK850 projector.</span>

<span>Lovin' it!  Just what I needed.  Purchased the Epson 5040 ub and due to its size I needed a new mount.  The problem I faced was that the Ideal location for the projector is exactly in front of the ac unit.  Weeellll I ain't removin' that!<br/><br/>In comes the QualGear.  Mounted it on the wall with the projector just about level with the top of the ac.  This mount has let me get centered as close as I can get without blocking the ac or hanging way down from the ceiling.<br/><br/>The adjustments are great!  This is my 3rd mount over the years.  Every time I get 'almost' centered to the screen.  With the left/right adjustments on this mount, this issue was quickly and easily fixed.<br/><br/>Mount is sturdy, albeit kinda big.  But works great.  I highly recommend it!</span>

<span>I’ve owned and installed dozens of projector mounts and this is by far one of the easiest and nicest ones yet! The micro adjustments work perfectly and the mount itself is very professional looking. Solid construction has prevented me from having to make minor adjustments over time and the channel down the middle is accessible from the top, giving me a great space to hide wires and other parts out of sight. I would recommend this to others and buy it again. The few dollars extra goes a long way in differentiating a good product from a great one, and this solution is pretty much perfect for the price in terms of flexibility of adjustment, wire management, and compatibility with a wide range of projectors.</span>

<span>I got this with my BenQ w1070.  This is my first projector and first experience mounting a projector to the ceiling.  Item appears as pictured.  It took a little under an hour to install with the help of a friend.  Most of that time was spent double checking measurements and assembling the mounting plate and arms.  The instructions are not terribly clear and detailed as to what bolt, screw, etc goes where and the illustrations are difficult to make out.  The text of the instructions are insanely tiny making it difficult to read.  It comes with screws to assemble and attach to ceiling.<br/><br/>Mount comes with a telescoping extension that you can use.  Or you can just attach the projector directly to the mounting plate.  Without the extension, I got about 4 to 5 inch clearance from the ceiling, which suited my purposes just fine.  I have a little under 8ft ceilings in the man cave.  Using the extension would have the projector hanging too low from the ceiling and would risk having people bump their heads against it.<br/><br/>Other reviewers have complained that the w1070 only has 3 attachment points while this mount has 4 arms.  I'm not sure if mine is a newer redesigned model, but I rectified the situation by only using the attachment arms when assembling the mount and left the unused one in the box.  I had to arrange the arms into a triangle of sorts to attach it to the projector and it seems to work.<br/><br/>The mount has a ball joint allowing a great deal of adjustment.  There is a locking mechanism that keeps the position in place.  However unlocked the joint moves very loosely so making fine adjustments will be difficult.  I found that if i partially engaged the lock, it minimized the play in the joint and allowed me to make finer adjustments.  It would be nice if you could adjust pitch, roll, yaw of the mount individually, but this mount has no way to do this.  Invariably when you adjust one, you may effect another.  So fine tuning position may take some time.</span>

<span>This mounting kit worked for a BenQ HT3050 projector and looks nice. It comes with all the screws and parts you need. You can have the cables going through the post and looks pretty clean after you do that. A few things need to improve -<br/>1. The cable openings on both ends of the post are not round-cornered and have no protection, they scratch the cables very easily when pulling cables through the post;<br/>2. There is no cable opening on the top END of the post for you to pull the cabled directly in to the ceiling so you can completely hide the cable on the top end;<br/>3. The "locks" between the post and the disk on the projector are not tight. It has a plastic lock and and a metal screw to protect the projector to loose and drop (safe and secure), but the final position is depending on the balance of the projector weight. This makes final projector-to-screen adjustment hard - you have to adjust it many times and next time you plugin a cable, it may change about an inch on a 100-in screen.</span>

<span>I struggled to give this mount more than one star for the simple fact that the screws that came with the BenQ mount (M5?/M6?) didn't fit my BenQ 2050A projector (M4).  I would check your projector user guide to find out the specs on the screws you need before you buy.  A quick trip to Lowe's remedied the situation and I was able to get the projector attached to the included arms.  The first thing you notice when you start removing components is how heavy duty and sturdy everything felt.  No thin metal or sharp edges to be found.  The instructions were easy to follow and everything fit together properly.  Minor adjustments were easy and it only took a few minutes to get positioned perfectly.  If the screws fit your projector (please check before buying), I think the build quality, ease of installation, and pleasing aesthetic make this a great choice for your ceiling mount needs.</span>

<span>The extension lengths are not as they say. You can have minimum mount distance at 5.02” with no extension -OR- you can use extension tube which adds ~11” and more. You CAN NOT adjust between 5” to 11”.<br/><br/>They include drywall anchors which are terrible. Plan to lag it to a ceiling joist, or if not possible you’ll need to use a block of wood between two joists. Do not trust four crappy drywall plastic anchors with your expensive hardware.<br/><br/>Otherwise it looks good and installation wasn’t too bad. I’m using it with a x3000i which it mounted easily too.<br/><br/>I’d probably use a different mount if I had to do it over again.</span>

<span>This is one of the many and I mean many projector ceiling stands I have installed in the 30 years of Projection Animated Attractions that we manage and work with some of which are Six Flaggs, Universal, Lagoon of Utah, and the Disney Company.  This particular stand can be seen in the FrightNight attraction at the lagoon theme park when the Halloween Scare and Scream 2018 opens.  This stand is used in a tight space but handling a projector that requires no vibration for it is mapping several terrifying and I mean scary scenes on various areas of the Veranda Entry.  Also something that is nice, by writing a review doesn't have to be positive of negative just the honest truth like mine they currently offer giving you a free 10ft 3d HDMI cable.  That's cool.  But even if they didn't they deserve this comment.  I also made sure your company name was appearing on the front face so if those looking back to see what is creating the scary scenes they will see your QualGear Logo on the extended arm.  I am preparing my requisitions for Sept and Ill need about 35 more. Please don't buy them all.  I am in need of these mounts, the others are a headache and bend and shake.  Thanks Qualgear.</span>

<span>Needed this to mount my new Optoma UHD51A projector closer to my screen due to the decreased zoom compared to my Epson 5030UB. This is an extremely well built mount with adjustment in just about any direction. The cables route down through the center of the rectangular sliding center with an exit out the bottom rear. The mount comes with 3 different sets of projector mounting legs to fit just about any home projector. The giant well organized/ labeled bag of retainer bolts/screws/washers is fantastic as it has everything I need. The black coating looks great and helps it blend in with the dark environment. The multitude of adjusters allowed me to get my protector image centered on my screen easily.  The mount came with the black coated lag bolts and a nice paper template to get all the holes marked and drilled easily. This is highly recommended to anybody looking to mount a small to medium sized home projector.</span>

<span>I use this mount with an Optima HD20.  It includes multiple screw sets for different size projector mounting holes and 2 allen wrenches.  The only tools I needed were a phillips screw driver and drill with a small bit for pilot holes where I mounted it to the ceiling.  The instructions are minimal, but it is not a complicated assembly.  The mount is designed for a projector with four holes, but my Optima HD20 only has three.  After my initial attempt to use it, I was ready to send it back because I could not figure out how to mount it to the Optima. The Optima's mounting points are much closer together than the arms on the mount, even when using the two supplied short brackets.  However, after thinking on it for a day, I was able to reconfigure the mounting arms to work by removing all the  arms, attaching them to the mounting holes on the projector, then reinstalling them to the mount backwards, thus shortening the distance between the mounting points.  In the end, I used only three of the four arms, and it works perfectly.  It would have been easier if the mount included more short mounting bracket.  It comes with 2, so it took me a full day to realize that I could still mount the longer ones backwards to shorten the distance.  The mount was flexible enough to allow me to make it work, without any modification to the mount it self, just some minor reassembly.  Once the projector was attached to the arms, attaching it to the ceiling was a no brainer.  I did not use the extension arms, but there was ample room to adjust and tighten the screws. I would have given it 5 stars if it had come with four short mounting brackets and better instructions to show how you could mount the brackets backwards without sacrificing its strength.</span>

<span>This is my first mount, and it was relatively easy to use and set up. I have an Optoma hd143x attached to it, and while there were a bazillion screws to attach projectors, nothing in the box fit the Optoma. Thankfully, I have lots of spare parts around and was able to use them to mount it. Also, the holes in the projector are quite close together, so it was tricky using this mount. It probably is easier on a projector that has hold far apart.<br/><br/>Mounting to the ceiling was super easy. I have a drop ceiling in my home theater room, so I just pulled out a panel, nailed a 2x4 between two joists, and used the included lag bolts to attach the mount. No problem.<br/><br/>I'd recommend this for your projector.</span>
