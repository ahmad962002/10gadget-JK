Product Description   The single best subwoofer you can get to put a little boom in your room, the Eris Sub8 is the first subwoofer to join the lauded and best-selling Eris studio monitor line. We called it Eris because it’s been designed from the ground up to be part of the family; it compliments the voicing and frequency response of the modern Eris classics The surprisingly loud 100-Watt Eris Sub8 drops down to a molar-rattling 30Hz, allowing you to both rock harder and produce better mixes, as you’ll be hearing an accurate representation of your work. Thanks to robust configuration and I/O, you’ll be able to tailor your Eris Sub8 configuration exactly to your mixing and listening needs. You can connect your existing monitors via ¼” TRS or RCA, set the input level to your liking, and even invert the polarity. Most importantly, you get a High Pass Filter and a Low Pass Crossover control that ensures your Sub8 starts working at the precise low-frequency point where your main monitors stop working. This makes sure you avoid the flubbery, smudged, low-end mess that one hears in redundant, duplicate, redundant bass reproduction that occurs without a crossover.   From the Manufacturer   Eris Sub 8 Compact Studio Subwoofer

<span>I’m an at home DJ😁. I bought these to use as monitors for my DJ set up. These speakers blew my mine away. For relatively small speakers the clarity, volume and quality of the sound was truly amazing !!!<br/>These speakers filled my entire basement, about 1200 sq ft with ease. I have the 3.5 I can’t imagine what the larger versions of these sound like.<br/>Again amazing speakers!!!!<br/>I hardly give reviews to be honest but I had to for these speakers.<br/>Don’t think twice about these!! I guarantee you will love them!!!</span>

<span>I decided to pull the trigger on purchasing these Presonus Eris E3.5-3.5" Near Field Studio Monitors based not only on reviews here on Amazon, but other music sites that sell them, because I wanted to span the universe of opinions as to what to expect with the sound quality vs. value.<br/>First, let me preface my review by stating two facts. #1: I've worked in radio and audio engineering for a long time, and my ears have been subject to a wide variety of pro &amp; semi pro and even amature gear. I can discern decent audio quality when I hear it.  #2: If you don't know the difference between a studio monitor and a pair of speakers, stop reading now &amp; move on to another review, because you just won't get it.<br/><br/>These monitors arrived well packed, in new condition, with all accessories inside the box, very simple. There's the power cord, a set of RCA cables, as well as a 1/8th" aux input cable, along with an instruction manual &amp; some rubberized pads to place on the bottom of the speakers if you desire to use them (as for me, I bought a pair of isolation foam pads as I found a great value on a decent pair, and I know good iso pads will make a difference *Trust me, they DO!*  Finally, there's a a interconnecting cable (it's six feet in length) that connects the master speaker (which is the left speaker) to the sattellite speaker (the right)<br/>Setup was EZ-PZ!<br/>Plugged in the aux connection cable to the speaker, and plugged the other end into my cell phone I loaded up with some test audio files I recorded on my DAW at 326Kbps.<br/>First impression when I began listening to the first track (Boston's More Than A Feeling) was the fade up intro sounded nice &amp; clean, and I was hearing very nice sounding instrumentation coming from the source audio.  I then proceeded to connect the RCA inputs to my new Audio-Technica AT-LP120XUSB Direct-Drive Turntable, which features a  AT-VM95E stylus.  I selected Mobile Fidelity Sound Lab's Electric Light Orchestra - Time.<br/>I selected this test disc due to my respect for Jeff Lynn as a recording engineer &amp; musician. He uses a wide range of analog &amp; synth instruments which i feel will help me judge the quality of these monitors, and they were sounds which I felt would fairly help me assess the frequency response these monitors are capable of delivering.<br/><br/>After listening to that album, &amp; then tossing another few disc's on the platter to compare what I was hearing (favorites always include Walter Eagen's - Magnet &amp; Steel &amp; Pink Floyd's - The Wall, I was convinced I was enjoying a true "Stereo Monitor" experience.  No need for me to color the neutral sound emanating from the speakers by adjusting the tonal controls on the back of the main speaker.  I was receiving a very nice signal from both the mp3 files I played through my phone using the aux-input jack (which is something I would be planning to do on occasion) and the sound quality output by the a AT-LP120XUSB Direct-Drive Turntable was very pleasing.<br/><br/>The room I am using these monitors in is a about 18' x 12', and there is no need for me to crank the volume up much past just below the halfway point to enjoy a pleasurable listening experience while I sit back on my couch and enjoy listening to music from a distance of about six feet away from where the monitors are place.<br/><br/>For the average audio fan looking for a decent, reliable, entry level pair of studio monitors to faithfully replicate audio (be it from a turntable, tape deck, or mp3 player) without any audio artifacts &amp; coloration, I would definitely recommend these  Eris E3.5-3.5" Near Field Studio Monitors  by Presonus.<br/><br/>Assuming these speakers wear well, and don't suddenly klunk out on me, I'm feeling very happy with my purchase &amp; look forward to utilizing them along with my new turntable I treated myself to, because (frankly) my ears were getting fatigued listening to some really crappy mp3 recordings,  and they say all things come full circle, while I prided myself converting my old analog production studio into a digital audio environment, even recording critical audio as a stereo .Wav file, and mp3's at the highest possible bitrate a given player would play back, nothing really matched the sonic excellence I can hear when playing back music on vinyl.  I wasn't going to go broke however returning to my musical playback roots, so I carefully researched and chose the components I budgeted for, &amp; am glad I chose these speakers to provide that last interface in the sonic delivery to my ears, in my opinion - these were a wise choice to make.</span>

<span>I have been looking for a sub to pair with my M-Audio BX5 D2s for a few months. I didn't have a ton to spend but desperately wanted some low-end reinforcement at my desk. This definitely does the trick. Compared to other subs I have heard in this price range ($230 USD for me) it is tighter sounding, goes lower, and leaves you with plenty of headroom to grow into.<br/><br/>My setup is mostly used for listening to music/videos and some video games at my desk at home. While this sub is not going to be anyone's pick for mixing/mastering in a professional environment it is plenty good for casual home use and doesn't break the bank.<br/><br/>I have been running live concerts on touring grade systems for 6 years or so now. I mix bands as well as set up and tune systems in many different environments. This is to say, while I don't do studio things I have a good idea of what a sound system should sound like.<br/><br/>I have the sub set up directly beneath my desk centered in front of my listening position. The sub is turned 90 degrees, so the driver and port are pointing off to the sides. The desk is about a meter and a half from the closest wall. I found after a small amount of tuning it blends perfectly with my monitors (Crossover: 120HZ Level: ~-20). With some tone generator testing, I have found the sub gets down to about 32Hz audibly and doesn't really seem to drop off until around 38Hz. This really impressed me. It is tight and clear through the entire frequency range I have it covering and perfectly compliments my monitors. I live in a very quiet place, my listening level ranges from 65-95 dBA @ .5m. Hopefully this gives you a good idea of the environment I am giving this review from.<br/><br/>I would recommend this sub for anyone looking to reinforce speaker monitors being used for casual listening or even some entry-level recording/mixing. Compared to other subs at this price point it is tighter sounding and gets plenty loud. My favorite genres of music are rock, hard rock, blues, folk, as well as modern pop, hip-hop, and many varieties of electronic music. I have found this sub works great for all. This sub surpassed my expectations and I expect to be using it for quite a while.</span>

<span>This sub is an incredible value. For the price, nothing comes even close!<br/><br/>It is not an 'audiophile' sub and won't rival hi end units costing 10X the price, but in my home studio it did the job adding bottom end to my Focal Shape monitors when needed. It isn't super tight but it has an incredibly high output. I've been using it with the gain turned almost all the way down to match my monitors.<br/><br/>I can't confirm that the LPF also functions as a HPF for the satellites. It doesn't sound like it but I've not formally tested to confirm. However, by playing with the crossover frequency on the sub and the HPF on the monitors, I was able to get a pretty seamless blend by ear.<br/><br/>If you want super accurate, tight low end you might want to invest a little more. However, for this price you get a full featured sub that puts out a lot of low end. Highly recommended.</span>

<span>I've had this sub for a few days, and it's absolutely superb for the price.  It can get very loud and push a lot air. I've set the volume to almost its lowest level and it still shakes my entire house. The circuitry is quiet -- it has not added any kind of noise to my setup.  The LPF knob functions as your crossover circuit. It is a little bit difficult to see the notch on the knobs, though - but that is a minor thing and I'm considering adding a touch of white correction fluid to see it better.  The Off/Auto/On switch is useful. Setting it to OFF bypasses the sub and routes the full audio signals to your monitors.<br/><br/>I've put up a few pics to show how I've set it up with my home rig. I tested several different positions, and turning it sideways gave me the best sound. It is sitting directly on the floor, however, and I intend to raise it off the floor a few inches as soon as I can work out how best to make that happen. The feet on the bottom of the cabinet only raise it about 1/2" to 5/8" of an inch. It's not really a big thing to worry about though.<br/><br/>Like a lot of us, I don't have a ton of money to spend on gear. I've long wanted a good sub for my setup, and this one definitely ticks the box at the right price. My monitors are Alesis M1Active 520s -- definitely not high end monitors, and they tend to clip easily when pushing deep bass signals through them. Now, I can push that bass into the sub instead and my overall sound experience has dramatically improved. I think I've got my LPF crossover set to 90 or 100hz. That seemed to work best with my setup in the basement.<br/><br/>If you're financially challenged and cannot afford a $1000+ sub woofer, then this one might be a good choice.</span>

<span>For the price, it should have come with the 5mm jacks instead of wimpy RCAs.  I'm on the fence with the volume remote too, as it comes with the 5mm jack and cranks the volume quite well, but balancing the crossover and the individual subwoofer volume leaves a lot to be deisired.  You can turn the subwoofer volume dial quite far without noticing much bass control independant of overall volume.  In all honesty, it seems that the volume on the monitor affects the richness of bass and sharpness of trebble better than the desk dial connected to the subwoofer. (I got the 8" monitors btw, not sure how the smaller ones work with this setup)  These are big, sturdy units too.  A little heavy, which means they stay where you put them but experimenting with location can be annoying.<br/><br/>Essentially, one must set monitor volume first, then set desk dial volume, then mess with crossover, then be sure the woofer is placed correctly. Rinse and repeat.  The individulal output dials on the back of the woofer seem to do nothing, but if they did that would be 2 more dials to mess with anyway.<br/><br/>Once I got the right upper limit I desired, I basically left the volume controls alone and instead set master volume through my other equipment, and that seems to work best.<br/><br/>For an 8" woofer it handles crisp kicks and rolling bass just fine for a home studio.  Some limitation could be due to the RCAs since I haven't found my 5mm jacks, and that's why I feel this product is a bit over priced without the stronger connection cords coming with it.<br/><br/>Compared to other woofers and PC speakers, this product holds it own and is near the top of the list with sound quality (no clipping, garble, or rattling) and does provide plenty of combinations for setup that satisfies the wiring nerd inside me.</span>

<span>I would have gave this speaker 10 stars if I could. I purchased a more expensive 8” studio monitor sub, and I returned it in 3 hours because I was adjusting bass by hand at the back of the sub. This guy has a cable remote. Perfect for desk top. (The remote) This sub will roll your room in good bass even at high levels. (I don’t turn any equipment beyond 75%,) but it ROCKS! Perfect with my existing monitors. Depending on how long it lasts, (I’m going on 3 months and at frequent high levels) the Bluetooth function is also killer convenient , if it lasts, Mackie Nailed it and knocked it out of the park. Hats off to Mackie! (please send free gear for mentioning your brand!!)</span>

<span>Compared to all the more expensive subs the look made me wary of purchasing so I went to YouTube and watched a few reviews, compared it to presonus sub which was initially the one I was after but in the comparisons the CR8S-XBT was a solid choice...also the fact I have MR5s it just made sense. The first day I hooked them up I got a little static so I checked my cables, leveled my volume on the monitors and the sub and now I have just enough sub to mix it in perfectly!! If you're on a budget especially in these times go with this sub. you will not be disappointed! UPDATE... I should've mentioned the knob pops and clicks in the speakers so I have to turn it back and forth until the pooping stops.</span>

<span>I have far too much audio gear, including tube this and turntable that, with all the attendant voodoo magic. Honestly, for 98% of humanity, a pair of these 8" Yamaha monitors, teamed with a Bluetooth streaming source—and of course a streaming service like Tidal/Spotify/Apple—is all you will ever need. For streaming, I'm using the Emotiva BTR-1 Virtual Copper™️ Bluetooth System ($80). So the entire system is the monitors, the BTR-1, two RCA cables with TRS adapters, and of course phone, iPad, etc. No CD player, no turntable, no power amp and pre-amp. Nothing more. It just sounds great. Yes, it isn't cheap. At current prices, the Yamahas + the BTR-1 will cost you $1,000. But you are now done. You're in a paradise of music. Today I streamed Monteverdi's "Orfeo," Errol Garner's "Ready, Take One," and the latest from Doja Cat. It all sounds very fine, especially the Monteverdi. The clarity and accuracy and projection of classical music is excellent. I feel bad, because I own many, many thousands of $$$ of super-high-class audio gear. And I CAN tell the difference. But how often are we at that level of "critical listening" ... ? You are all set with this package. btw the word "flat" when describing studio-monitor sound typically means that the response curve is level over the entire frequency range: Low sounds are not boosted, nor are high: All frequencies are created equal. So in theory—and to my ears, in practice—this means reproduced music sounds closer to live music. I live in Manhattan USA, am often in Carnegie Hall and at the Metropolitan Opera. I'd have to say: These Yamaha 8” monitors really do deliver accurate, true-to-life sound. Again: $1,000 for very fine audio is a lot. But you will need nothing more. The entire world, and the entire history, of music is at your fingertips.</span>

<span>THESE. ARE. SO. RAD. ( I got the HS7's FYI ).<br/><br/>I reference any other speakers off of the pair of Bowers and WIlkins 684 floorstanders that I have. Keep in mind that these cost half the price of those and I am just as impressed, all things considered. While these don't produce as "big" of a sound and can't pump out as much volume due their much smaller size, they sound just as pristine to my ears. Now, don't get me wrong, these can fill a bedroom sized room with plenty of sound to satisfy a reasonable listener. Especially if they are placed within a few feet of your ears as I believe they are intended to be placed. That is where they sound best. I have mine about 3 feet from each ear and it is good.<br/><br/>When I first fired these up they sounded a little bright or maybe even harsh on higher treble end. Either I got used to that or they broke in nicely, because they sound just right now after about a hundred hours of use at low to medium volume.<br/><br/>At lower volume they tend to lack a little bottom end, and at very high volume the clarity suffers and things start getting a little distorted and muddy. At medium to medium-high volume is where these really shine. If you're using these as studio monitors as they are intended to be used, this volume range is where you'd want to be listening anyways, for various reasons. For one, you don't want to listen at loud volumes for long periods because it will fatigue your ears to the point that listening is longer pleasurable and probably not as objective as is necessary. Also you can damage your ears. You only get one set of ears. Once they're messed up, that's it. I already have some ringing in my ears from my younger days and wish I could go back and do those rock concerts over with ear plugs. Another reason is that if you mix with your speakers at high volume, it won't translate well to anyone who ever listens to what you're mixing at lower volumes. So if your sounds are ever going to be played anywhere besides a dance club, this is a legit reason. So that's that. Right there in the middle of the volume range these puppies are capable of very nice sounding audio.<br/><br/>I've heard other people wonder about these as an option general music listening speakers, like you would with a good set of hifi speakers. On top of using them as studio monitors, I use them for this purpose too. I like listening to all of the music I listen to on them. If you aren't the kind of person that feels like Beats by Dre are the greatest sounding audio experience ever on the face of all of the universe, I'd bet you'll enjoy these. These will not blast your eardrums will ungodly amounts of bass and treble very loudly like Beats do. They will, however, show you a crystal clear image of what your music really sounds like. And if it' good music, it'll probably sound very good on these.<br/><br/>Also, on top of of all this, they look great, and the finish on the exterior is pretty durable too. I dropped a hammer or something rather on top of one of them and it didn't even leave a mark.<br/><br/>TLDR;  I love them and highly recommend them is what this all boils down to If you can fit these in you budget, do it. Really one of the more satisfying purchases I've made. There may be better out there, but not at this price.  //end rant.</span>

You're not monitoring without a sub are you? It's the 21st century for crying out loud! Gone are the days of wimpy, baseless tracks!

The JBL LSR310S reaches all the way down to 27Hz, so there's no doubt it'll faithfully reproduce the lowest lows, making sure you always have a clear picture of the bass in your tracks. Beef up your studio playback with the 200-watt, powered JBL LSR310S subwoofer.

<span>I bought this ti match my JBL’s for my desk.  The addition of the sub makes the speakers and the whole set fill in with a good level of bass.  The switches in the back are useful, and once set, don’t really need to be touched, again.  I wish there was some kind of indication light (front or back) that let the person know that it’s ON, like the speakers, but, that’s not the case.  Other than that, it’s a fine sub if you have JBL speakers, like me.  Love the additional base for games, movies, songs, etc.</span>

<span>These speakers do not have a "flat" frequency response. Almost, but there's a 1-2db boost at 2.6K and again at 4K and above. It can easily be dealt with with an equalizer.

<span>In my experience, I got these (8s), but they did not reproduce the sound as well as my DT 990 PRO headphones. The music just seemed flat on delivery, not juicy, maybe mid was too strong, not sure what it was. While all frequencies seemed to be represented, it just seemed like something was getting lost. Maybe the bass wasn't punchy, although it could be when I turned up the bass on my mixer, but it was still off the mark. Maybe I could get it just right by tuning them, but I figured if I disliked them out of the box, it was better to go with something else. I got the Yamaha HS8, which do a much better job imho. I am a layman, though, and maybe that's just my experience, there are lots of raving professional and user reviews about these.<br/><br/>The build quality and appearance on these is great, btw.</span>

The Rockville APM10 is an Active Studio Subwoofer that delivers unbelievable sounding bass! These subs put out an amazing 400 watts peak power and 200 watts RMS power. We spent a lot of time developing the most premium studio subwoofer we&rsquo;ve built to date! I am very pleased and excited to talk to you guys about what we did to make this subwoofer sound as good as it does. If you are an audiophile you will find what we did to be quite amazing. Keep in mind, the only reason our price point is not 300 % higher is because you are buying manufacturer direct. We are one of the leading speaker manufacturers in the USA, and we have a state of the art manufacturing process. There is a lot to talk about so I will break it down into sections.Description of the enclosure:We chose a wooden enclosure as opposed to a plastic enclosure. Your studio is made of wood for a reason. The sound characteristics of high quality wood are better than plastic. We only use the highest quality MDF wood. We do not bother with cheap particle board material when we want to make the best speakers. The thickness is 0.7&rdquo; around and the front board is a full 1&rdquo; thick to give you the best sound quality possible. The enclosure is built with the perfect amount of air space to maximize sound quality for a studio.Every studio or computer room should look beautiful. We believe speakers should enhance the look of a room. We make these subwoofers in 3 beautiful finishes. Painted black, painted white, and wood finish. We use &ldquo;baking paint&rdquo; made for wood surfaces. It is long lasting and the best paint for speakers! We went with a beautiful finish that is mostly matte with a slight shine to it. Our designers spent countless hours on the color to make sure it is not only beautiful but elegant as well to improve the appearance of your studio or room.

<span>Great speakers; the thing I didn't like is that the PROPRIETARY CABLE AND CONNECTOR that connects the two speakers is only 8 feet long. That means the speakers cannot be more than 8 feet apart.<br/><br/>This is really a problem if you need to go around something like a window with the cable since small speakers are usually on a wall, or want to position them more than 8 feet apart<br/><br/>Background: The right speaker plugs into a 115V wall receptacle, and receives the stereo signals from the source. I used RCA cables from the source and had no hum. This proprietary cable then connects the right speaker to the left speaker.<br/><br/>The cable carries four conductors, two for the electricity for the amp in the left speaker, and two for the signal to the left speaker. Signal wires can be very small and delicate.<br/><br/>The company advised me against splicing the cable due to signal shielding. The company offered to sell me another 8 foot cable for $25 and provided a link to a coupling for $20.<br/><br/>I put the otherwise great speakers in a less than optimal location and I was unable to hide the cable.</span>

Those are only 50w like the 3" as well.<br/><br/>I haven't heard the "static" that others have mentioned in the reviews, (though there is always going to be the "noise" that Class A speakers have) so I just could be lucky I guess. I recommend to others if it's that noticeable exchange them for another pair, they are really fantastic speakers.<br/><br/>I absolutely LOVE these things and they can really put out some noise. They could easily be loud enough for a good sized house party, they just wouldn't have enough bass to give it a real "club" feel. Just using them in my studio I leave them at about 1/4 power and if I'm really jamming I still never get above 1/3 on my mixer.<br/><br/>They sound really crisp as well, they don't distort. They put out a good clean sound - that can also get quite loud as well. The only thing I wish that they had that the Mackie CR3s have is Bluetooth - not for hooking up for producing, but just to jam out with or hook a phone up, something of that nature. But I can easily hook a headphone -&gt; RCA cable up to my mixer (or the speakers themselves), so Bluetooth isn't that big of a necessity.<br/><br/>As far as my credentials for judging/rating these speakers (as opposed to some one who equates volume-that-makes-your-ears-bleed with quality sound) go:<br/><br/>I've been a DJ for 13 years spending over a decade of gigging in clubs around the city - for a good stretch of it every night of the week. As far as pro audio goes, I learned from a guy I DJ'd with. He's a classically trained club owner, musician, and also a promoter in the business for 20 years at the time I began working with him. He (and later I) setup the majority of the city's local clubs' sound and lighting systems. For big shows and events he is usually the one to rent gear from when the clubs needed to rent gear (for the gear that's in the artist's riders). Even if not needed, we generally ran sound for the big events as well.<br/><br/>Seriously, buy these speakers. This is by far the longest review I've ever written (not just on Amazon), but I wanted to make sure I got all the information in here to support my argument as to why I can't recommend these enough.</span>

<span>I tried a pair of Prosonus same timeframe. No comparison. First wattage, weight, then rest of specs blew those speakers out of the water. Then I listened to my flac files. As close to audiofile quality as I could imagine if they were twice the price.  On top of everything else, speaker build exudes quality. Factory direct indeed.</span>

<span>The issue I have is simple, so I still want to fully utilize the sound bar and use the 3Mm jack up front but it seems that the audio gets reversed on my earphones. What I mean is the sound of the  left earphones  goes to right and vice versa.<br/><br/>I would’ve given this 5 stars if that wasn’t an issue as this would save me the trouble of having a headset or having too many wires on my table.<br/><br/>Aside from that it sounds great.</span>

<span>I was going to buy some speakers to put on the sides of my pc monitor but my desk was already limited on space. These… still don’t really fit on my desk since it doesn’t have as much depth as I thought but it could be easily solved.<br/>These speakers sound great IF you don’t turn them up all the way. At higher volumes, the audio turns to mush. But note that my ideal audio level for these is like 25 percent. These speakers get loud quick.<br/>Also, the Bluetooth is always on, even if your audio input is set to aux or usb. I ended up completely disconnecting my phone to these speakers.<br/>These are good speakers. I planned on buying other Mackie speakers since it looks like I can connect these to additional speakers.</span>

<span>I ordered this in July and just opened the box. There is no power cord. I can't test anything if I can't power the soundbar.</span>
