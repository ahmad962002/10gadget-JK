<span>These leds are so much brighter than my worn out halogens in my 2011 Prius. Replaced the running lights, wish I had done it sooner. They were easy to install, plugged them in and they worked, no issues. Didn't rate them yet for longevity, just bought them.</span>

<span>We recently purchased a 2012 Prius V. Somehow it "passed inspection" but by the time we drove it home there were about 4 things wrong with it. Having just emptied my wallet to buy the car, I thought I'd DIY the headlight replacement for cheap. I'm a middle-aged woman who loves to fix things around the house, but I have never worked on cars.<br/><br/>THANK YOU fine people of the Internet, for providing detailed guidance to make this installation easier! I did not "enjoy" the process, but man, was it ever satisfying! I think it took under an hour to go from one faint, yellowed low beam to two bright white, possibly a wee bit blinding, beacons.<br/><br/>Wear gloves (I like nitrile gardening type gloves for a little grip) and make sure the headlights have been off for a while so they are cool when you start your install. Consult YouTube. Have small hands if possible, that would really be a big help. You need a screwdriver and ratchet wrench that can get into tight places so you can move hoses and tanks out of the way. Seriously, watch the video if you're new to this.<br/><br/>Allow about an hour for this process, don't rush yourself, and don't force things if you can't get it to connect or release. I found it tough to disconnect the old headlights, which I believe were original to the car. You kinda have to press just right, which is hard because you can't really see what you're doing.<br/><br/>This kit is a great value, and now I know how to replace them if needed in our other cars.<br/><br/>Good night vision: essential.<br/><br/>Feeling of satisfaction: PRICELESS.</span>

<span>Easy install as advertised. Fit perfectly with my 2016 honda accord. Honda headlights are pretty temperamental with aftermarket LED but these came equipped with drivers so they work well.<br/><br/>It's worth noting that some of the reviews say it's not bright at all. In my experience these are perfectly bright for low beams.</span>

<span>After a month of being installed I’ve run into a slight annoyance. While using my turn signal sometimes my headlight will turn off on the turn signal being operated. A quick switch from on to auto lights turns the bulb back on. But I would be cautious about that. Besides that they are super bright/ white/ and long distance.</span>

Contacted the manufacturer and within 24hrs I was offered to purchase a new pair with a full refund. So I decided to upgrade to a newer model. The company still offered a full refund. I placed my order made my payment and the delivery is actually coming two days early and within 24hrs of my order being shipped my refund was sent.

<span>We purchased the Bevinsee LED headlights for my wife's 2012 Toyota Camry XLE V6 that has halogen bulbs in their projector housings.<br/>I would like to start  by mentioning that the build quality is very solid from aircraft grade aluminum and the installation was direct plug and play.<br/>The light output was definitely on par with the output from my OEM units on my Infiniti Q50, so brightness is not an issue. I did like that the have a fan for cooling and that the relay is an attached separate component.<br/>All that is left is waiting to see what the longevity, but at the present we are pleasantly surprised and quite happy with the overall price, installation ease and look of the final product. I didn't have to realign the units so that was great.<br/>I highly recommend them over other kits and there are several YouTube videos showcasing them. For the price and what we received I am glad and urge anyone that wants to try them to do so. My wife was so happy to have the added illumination and extra viewing clarity with these over her halogen headlights. She would even use the Q50 at night to see better which is what we both always felt was best.<br/>Do yourself, your loved ones and other drivers a big favor by picking up a set.<br/>I even intend to order a second pair to swap out the fog lights as well.</span>

<span>First off. Wow. These. Things. Are. BRIGHT. Now that we've cleared the air let's get into it. The lights were super easy to install on my 2010 Buick LaCrosse and, after I tested the fitment, I bought 2 more pairs just for fun. Just kidding. I got them for my fog lights and high beams. My windows and windshields are tinted which is great during the day but I like to be able to see when I drive at night as my neighborhood isn't super well lit and I don't have tapetum lucidum. Being a human can be so inconvenient at times. Anyways...  I would say I can see about as easy now as I could with regular halogen bulbs without the tint but the white light certainly makes it even easier to see. I bought them almost exactly one year ago and they've lasted with 0 issues and only a handful of people getting triggered that my lights seem a bit too bright for their poorly developed photoreceptors. Anyways... That was true. Until today. Now, I have not run a full diagnostic to see if the issue is with my car (possibly a fuse or the alternator depending on which mechanic I ask--typical) or with the bulb, but I can say the flickering I am getting with one of the bulbs is certainly annoying and a safety hazard for oncoming traffic especially since I can't label my presence with an epilepsy warning. Anyways... I don't have a video because, of course, the little sucker has performance anxiety and only shows up to work when I don't want it to but what can ya do. Kids. Anyways... I will update this post when I find out more. Overall, I give the H11 product a 3.5/5 stars for being only even just mildly annoying nearly a year after install.</span>

I’ll try them in the dark tonight.<br/><br/>Install is easy as far as the bulbs. The difficulty comes from the vehicle engineering.<br/><br/>I cannot comment on longevity yet.

<span>I bought the combo, and was impressed with an easy install and good fit. However, since my 2021 Subaru Crosstrek (premium, originally halogen) has daytime running lights that are undefeatble, these DRL’s utilize the high beams (bulb 9005 in the set) to run on lower power during the daytime. This is the major demerit of the set, as running low power like this makes those high beam bulbs flicker during daytime when the beams go into DRL mode. I attempted to buy a decoder which adds a second relay to fix the problem from Alla but it did not solve the issue. I returned the decoder and swapped the original halogen high beams back in.<br/><br/>I live in a suburban area with a lot of traffic, and rarely drive at night so using high beams is super rare- maybe once or twice in total per year. To be up front I did not attempt to contact Alla as I wanted to sort my headlights (ocd) on my own and not be on hold for hours for something that’s basically stupid to worry about.<br/><br/>I will keep the set because these are high quality, but if buying for a Subaru with factory halogens, I recommend buying the H11 only, and get a pair of 9005 Sylvania white bulbs to better match the LED low beams. The low beam LED are so great compared to the stock halogen bulbs, I never foresee a need to use my high beams. Also, this is no demerit on the bulbs themselves. I own a 2015 Ford and would easily buy a similar set for it. The difference being the daytime running lights (DRL) for my Ford can be shut off on a menu screen controlled by steering wheel buttons. If my Subaru allowed the same I would have used both high and low beam led bulbs.<br/><br/>I hope this is helpful. If your car has no DRL’s buy them!</span>

<span>I used Paula lighting in many vehicles and this is another great example that they have provided. These lights are easy to install, they are high quality and they last a long time. I’ve used these headlights or similar ones in so many different vehicles and they always perform really well.</span>

<span>Purchase this product because I was looking for a quality lighting.<br/>Phillips is a well known company, figured I cant go wrong.<br/>Well the bulbs weren't as bright as I thought they would be, since this was the  premium version.<br/>The bulbs lasted for less that 6 months before they both blow a day apart.<br/>Better off purchasing there standard bulbs for the same results.</span>
