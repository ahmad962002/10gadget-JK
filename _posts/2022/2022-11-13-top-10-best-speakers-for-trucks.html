Music will sound its best with ACDelco GM Original Equipment Car Speakers, and are GM-recommended replacements for your vehicle’s original components. Speakers turn electrical energy into mechanical energy to move air, using a permanent magnet and an electromagnet. The electromagnet is energized when the radio or amplifier (if equipped) delivers current to the voice coil on the speaker. The voice coil will form a north and south pole that will cause the voice coil and the speaker cone to move in relation to the permanent magnet. The current delivered to the car speaker is rapidly changing alternating current (A/C). This causes the speaker cone to move in two directions, producing sound. These original equipment car speakers have been manufactured to fit your GM vehicle, providing the same performance, durability, and service life you expect from General Motors.

<span>I used some old bookshelf speakers in the workshop and they sounded good until they gave up the ghost. I cut the front off of those speakers, made a new faceplate out of MDF and glued these on with some RTV and brad nails. They sound good. Not a ton of bass but they aren't really big enough for that anyways.</span>

The SS8P is an all in one solution to give you great sounding bass in your vehicle without taking up a lot of space. This sub enclosure is only 2.8" thick so that it can easily fit under your seat. The amplifier is built in, so installation and wiring is clean and simple. This is a true all in one subwoofer solution with the subwoofer built into the enclosure along with a top of the line amplifier built in as well. We focused on making installation a breeze so we designed this unit with you the customer in mind. We added high level inputs so you can install this to an aftermarket or factory system. The high level input allows you to install this even if you have no preamp outputs available. The smart turn-on circuit will sense that an audio signal is present and turn on the amplifier. When you turn off your music signal the amplifier built into this subwoofer system will automatically turn itself off. Something else we did to make installation quick and easy is we put all the inputs and outputs on one side. This makes wiring neater and easier. Our competitor's models are more challenging to install. The SS8P has 400 watts of peak power and 100 watts RMS. This has great controls so you can adjust the sound to your liking. It has a level control for the volume and subsonic filter to filter out the really low frequencies which the human ear cannot hear. This also has a low pass crossover filter, phase control, input sensitivity, and bass boost. Included is a remote bass knob, and mounting hardware but the best thing about our model is the sound. It is slim but it sounds like a full sized subwoofer If you are not happy with it we will offer you a 90-day money back guarantee. If you don't like the sound, we will send you a pre-paid label and refund you in full!

<span>Honestly, I was not expecting much for a subwoofer of this size and price. I have a Chevy Astro van and have always been disappointed by how the 6.5" speakers that go around the van just don't produce any bass - even if you upgrade the head unit and the speakers. It always sounded like a tin can in there at any volume. I decided to try this Rockville sub out - it's only a bit over $100 so I really wasn't expecting anything. I spent a couple of hours wiring it up under the driver's seat (found a spare slot in the fuse box with a large wire running to it, no reason to run power directly from the battery for such a small amp) and was wildly surprised when I turned it on! It REALLY booms, and not just vibration but a good quality sound too. I wasn't looking for giant bass, so I actually turned it down a bit from the middle settings it comes at. It's not just the driver that feels the bass, the entire van now has rich sound that fills the full spectrum. I didn't bother wiring up the remote as I don't need any more things hanging around in the van, I just spent some time tuning the three knobs on the amp to my taste. The sub/amp also play very well with the volume on the head unit, so that at low volumes you have the perfect amount of bass and it scales well as you crank it up. I really can't believe such a small sub does so much!</span>

<span>I have a 1993 Saturn SL1 and I have been trying to get adequate bass in the car. For one the car is not very sound proof, you can hear all the road noise, bumps and what not's. The trunk for some reason has very good sound proofing, so it is hard to pass bass from the trunk to the passenger compartment. My set up is fairly simple, I have 2 Crunch PA1400.2 running front and rear, I have a JBL 400w RMS running Rockford Fosgate Prime Dual 10" Sub Box in the trunk. The issue is I can get the thump, but I am missing the mid to mid-bass in the passenger compartment. Since I do not want to cut holes in the rear door to mount additional speakers I found this and thought maybe this will work.<br/><br/>I mounted it on the rear parcel shelf right in between the 2 rear speakers. I set the trunk Rockford Fosgate Prime Dual 10 crossover to run from dc to 90 HZ and set the Rockville SS8P 400w 8" Slim crossover to run from 90 HZ to 125 HZ and set the High-pass filter on the front and rear to cut off at 100 HZ.<br/><br/>Now you want to talk about bass, this fills in great as a mid to mid-base speaker. I get mid to mid-base fill-in  in the passenger compartment and I get the punch and hard hitting base from my subs in the trunk.<br/><br/>The product has good built quality, it was easy to install even though i did not install under my seat (as it would not fit) I did call the MFG to find out if mounting it on the parcel shelf with it exposed to direct sunlight would be an issue and they said no it would not as it would have ample air flow, and direct sunlight on the top would not affect the electronics.<br/><br/>The manual is straight forward, basically 3 wires, Positive (red), Ground (black) and remote turn on (blue), and RCA plugs. I just wired it into my distribution block, placed on the parcel shelf with adhesive and i was done, did not use the remote control as my deck has that feature built in.<br/><br/>I know that my installation may not be standard, or I may not be using the product as designed a "SUBWOOFER" but as a mid to mid-base driver it delivers good solid reproduction in those ranges ( 90 HZ to 125 HZ), no distortion, no rattle in the cone, good disbursement of frequencies. This product did what I wanted it to do was fill in the mid to mid-base range.<br/><br/>If you read my review please understand that I am not using this as a "SUBWOOFER", I cannot tell you how it preforms in that aspect, but I can tell you this is a solid product, has good build quality, has good sound ( in reference to my application of the product), has good customer and Technical Support Services, and for only $100 or so a good value.</span>

<span>Love RF, and have several Punch/Prime products.  These are great speakers, however be aware that Amazon states these are a "amazonCONFIRMEDfit" for 2007-2017 Jeep Patriot/Compasses, and they are not, unless you want to cut them and the interior door panels of your vehicle.<br/><br/>The mounting surrounds on these are fatter than stock and have extra material around the mounts that do not seat in the factory positions.  There is also a plastic panel inside all the doors of the Jeep that surrounds a portion of the speaker (which these do not clear).  If you don't mind cutting (and voiding any chance of return), you can mate these up.  Also be aware though the connectors for positive and negative terminals are also fatter than standard for the common speaker wiring harnesses/adapters sold here as well, so you'll have to improvise there too.<br/><br/>If you want a factory fit RK upgrade, just look for the Prime series RF 6x9s.  I have the Prime 3-way 6x9's now, and they are a direct replacement, although are a bit lower wattage than the Punch series.</span>

<span>These speakers work well. They fit okay in my 2001 Toyota echo. Sound is good. They handle high volumes. My only complaint is the screws they provide are so long, they wouldn't fit properly in my mount without poking through to the steel in the car, even with the covers on. I didn't want to fish around for better screws so there is a bit of a gap between the head of the screw and the cover.

<span>Impressed with the sound these offer, and the clarity of the sound. They sound rich, especially compared to some cheaper speakers I opted to put in the front of my truck.<br/><br/>These aren't incredible by any means, there are certainly speakers out there that will outperform these. That said, these offer an excellent price-to-performance ratio that I think most listeners will be pleased with.<br/><br/>Install wasn't entirely painless. There was no way to get four screw holes flush with the sheet metal of my truck to screw it in, so I opted to instead reuse the plastic factory founds. This works pretty well, I haven't noticed any significant rattle but it may be impacting sound quality a bit. You could probably get away with using 3 screws, but the self-tapping screws I was using were rather loose and the OE mount was a better option in my particular case. May go back and screw it another time.</span>

<span>I got these to replace the dash speakers in my 2006 Jeep Wrangler.  Nice speakers for the money.  I read reviews from others and realized I needed the adapter plates for these to fit my jeep, but that's a jeep thing and they were only like 12 or 14 bucks or something like that.  I also purchased the plug adapter so I wouldn't have to splice the new speaker wires into the factory plug.  (RED WOLF for 2002-2019 Jeep, Chrysler, Dodge Vehicles Aftermarket Front Rear Door Speaker Adapter Wire Harness Connector Plug)  Back in the day I would have spliced, but now it's just so much easier to get the adapter and it's pretty cheap.</span>
