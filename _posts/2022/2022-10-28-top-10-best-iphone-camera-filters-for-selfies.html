<li class="a-spacing-small"><span class="a-list-item a-size-base"> 【12’’ LED Ring Light】A beefy 12-inch ring light that kicks out 20W of power from 240 LEDs, more powerful than the similar 10-inch model (which produces 8W of power).

<span>I saw this light stand recommended by a professional photographer on YouTube and bought it. Absolutely worth every penny. The dimmable ring light is super bright on its brightest setting so I could take good photos even indoors at night in a room with crappy lighting. The ring light can be easily turned and angled. The stand is easy to adjust in height and has a nice wide base to keep it sturdy even if you bump into it sometimes (which I do). The grip for your phone sadly only lets you put the phone in landscape mode, which is not great when you want to take vertical portraits and want to fully see what you're doing using your entire phone screen. But it holds your phone tightly so it doesn't wobble even when you have to tap on your phone screen a lot to review the shots you've taken so far. And SURPRISE...mine came with a bluetooth clicker that easily paired with my Android phone (I didn't realize it came with the clicker and spent a bunch of time buying one separately). I had the whole thing set up and ready to take pics within about 4 minutes. It also folds right back down to an easy to store size...save the box it comes in for easier storage since the ring light needs to separate from the stand for storage.</span>

<span>The ring light plugs in via usb, it is very bright. I love how you can choose the cool/warmth from the light. I also love how your phone can be in landscape or portrait mode. Mine didn’t come with a remote but the touch sensor on the light is great.</span>

<span>A portable light would've been better than being tied to an AC wall plug. While a tablet fits, the sturdiness isn't there having wobble. The tripod extension is good, although the handle being the three legs isn't so comfortable to hold. Remote works with either format, iPhone and Android,</span>

<span>I gave this a five star because of the functionality and customer support Amy! We had a funny misplaced part that our youngest son had moved because he thought it was my wife's car key fob, in turn it was what we thought a part was missing. We  contacted Ubeesize customer service and within 6 hours Customer Service Team Amy contacted us to replace the missing part. Our Family had a laugh in turn we were embarrassed that our child had moved it (doing the right thing) setting it where he believed the key fobs are supposed to be. Our apologies to Amy and our Thank Yous all in a same day in which is un heard of. We recommend UBEESIZE products 1000%.</span>

<span>This is all you need. Don’t waste your time going through other tripods, looking through reviews and doubting it. Just get it and thank me later. It’s freaking amazing. I had originally bought a $14 tripod at Walmart but I returned it because it was only about 3ft tall… I’m glad I did. I was super desperate and wanted to just get another one at Walmart for a higher price but it didn’t come with a remote!! I’m so glad I chose to buy this tripod on Amazon. It’s 6ft tall (reminds me of my ex.. ima call him after this) it has a Bluetooth remote!!! The phone holder flips and is super secure on the phone without being too Aggresive. I just love it. Take my word for it, BUY IT NOW</span>

<blockquote><em><div class="a-row a-spacing-small review-data"><span class="a-size-base review-text review-text-content" data-hook="review-body">
<span>Works great if you buy your own double sided sticky tape. I used Gorilla Glue 25lb mounting tape. The provided tape will absolutely fall off when you remove this and getting the magnet out of the lens mount is a challenge. I had to use a box razor to get it because you don’t have a lot of room to pry it out once it gets stuck in there.<br/><br/>Also, no you can’t use most cases with this device unless you stock the magnet on the car but the light seal is not great.<br/><br/>Lastly, this will cover the back microphone and make sound terrible. Trying to use the side mic to record what’s in front of the rear camera is no hood.<br/><br/>Best thing to do is buy this, an easy to remove case or bumper, a mounting rig and an external mic.<br/><br/>This does work great though and nd filters are the only way to control this exposure on an iPhone when you don’t have control over the lighting. This is the only way I found to get high quality footage at a low frame rate with twice the shutter speed while filming outdoors in daylight. You will also be able to take photographs with a longer shutter to get motion blur when you use ND-filters.<br/><br/>I like it. It was cheap and easy to use. I can slap this on and start filming any time with very little effort.</span>

<span>Great product. The only con is the adhesive for the magnet is not strong enough so it fell off. Easy fix - I had some other thin double sided tape and cut a small piece to use.</span>

<span>What a great idea but short on delivery, can’t seem to find a good lens holder for a phone out there I’ve tried everything and all of them for short! This was a great idea I thought it would actually work but the sticker does not stick to the phone the magnet tears it right off, therefore it’s no good!</span>

<span>This is a great idea, much better than those ugly clip-ons. That said, I had a few issues that could be fixed in the next generation.<br/><br/>First, it weighs a bit much. No reason to use aluminum this thick. The iPhone 13 Pro Max is already right on the edge of being too heavy for popular gimbals like the DJI, and with this and a case, things can start to get wobbly. Just thin it down a bit.<br/><br/>Second, the included tape is much too weak for such a strong magnet. Use a smaller magnet or better tape.<br/><br/>Third, the unit doesn’t sit absolutely flush with the included tape - it either needs to angle down a mm or 2 where the magnet is, or we need thicker tape.<br/><br/>I’m going to buy some thick strong tape to see if that works, and if I can get it to work with the ultra thin case that’s coming, I may end up gluing it.<br/><br/>Very useful otherwise - you need an ND filter for bright days with the 13 ProMax, and circular polarizers are good for virtually all shooting conditions, esp on bright days near water or in scenes with glass.</span>

<span>I use this to do macro photography. It fits over my Canon G5 and G16 lenses just right. The light can do a few different levels of brightness and has some adjustment for warmth.  The only downside is that it does not hold a charge very long. I have an old ring light and that battery's charge will last a few months if you only turn it on for a few seconds here and there. This light runs itself out in a day or two, I assume due to internal circuitry. However, it charges by USB so you can power it with any sort of cell phone battery booster, and I always have one of those in my camera kit. Would recommend.</span>

About the Startup Describe your product in 3 words.Smartphone Camera RigHow did you come up with the idea for this product?Back when smartphones were just starting to offer HD video recording, we immediately saw the potential for using our phones for amateur and professional photography/videography, now known as “phoneography.” We couldn’t find any product that could fit our phones and give us all of the tools we needed, so we created one ourselves. After successfully completing our first Kickstarter campaign for the original Beastgrip, we knew there was a huge demand for a product like this, which pushed us even harder to create an even better version - the Beastgrip Pro.What makes your product special?There’s no other product on the market that works with all smartphones and is powerful enough for professional use. We have the most versatile tool in the world or amateur and professional phoneographers, and it’s built like a BEAST.What has been the best part of your startup experience?For us, the “beast” part of our experience is watching people use our product to create things we didn’t know were possible yet. We love seeing all of the amazing photos and videos that our customers share with us every day, which reminds us why we’re here. Go #phoneography!

<span>I got my first Beastgrip from the 2015 Kickstarter they ran, and I've literally had it on every set I've ever worked on just in case. Sometimes I used it, sometimes I didn't, but I always have it. I also tend to take it with me on days off just, taking it around everywhere I go - I mount mine on a monopod, pick a lens or two for the day and keep them in a pocket, and just carry the whole thing around. It's very lightweight, very versatile, and especially when I use it with my Note 10+ (which has a wireless stylus with programmable button functions) it's just easy to use.</span>

<span>Holy moly! This is the BEST THING EVER! I actually bought this because of a recommendation from a TikToker that I follow, and I’m SO glad I listened to her! This is the coolest contraption! First - This is a great price for what you get! I mean, I would literally pay $60 for something like this (easily) and it would still be worth the price. Second - I love how versatile it is! There are three different types of light settings (blue, bright, and yellow... those are just my names for them!). And each light setting can also be dimmed down or brightened up about 5x up or down. So there are about 15 different light settings included with this. There’s also four different heights it can be set to. Personally, I prefer the tallest one because it’s right at about my height and it’s even with my face when I’m standing up (I’m 5’6”). So that’s a major plus! But you can use any of the other 3 settings for whatever your needs are. It’s super easy to switch between the different heights. It’s basically just a clip that you undo and then you just re-clip it when you have the height you need or want. Third - This remote that it came with is the bomb!! I’m happy with just this alone LOL. I can use it for videos AND pictures! And it’s so simple, and so fast. There’s absolutely no delay time between when I press the remote button and when my phone’s camera responds. Fourth - It fits my huge phone! I currently have an iPhone 11 Pro Max with a bulky case and a Popsocket on it, and I was able to fit my phone with both the case and Popsocket in the mount holder with no problems (horizontally and vertically). On both settings, my phone felt secure. Vertically, I was concerned it would slowly start to fall out but the mount gripped my phone really well! Fifth - The size of this ring light for the cost is like buying a professional one for a 10th of the cost. Those professional ones are hundreds of dollars! This, in my opinion, is just as amazing as those, if not better!!! Seriously. If you’ve been looking for a ring light for a while, stop looking right now and buy this. Period. You truly will not regret it. I’m not being paid to write this and I’m not writing it for any other reason than to share my thoughts with you guys. The packaging was nice and efficient. It came with directions for assembly as well as directions for pairing the little remote with your phone (iOS and/or Android!). The USB cord that the ring light needs to be plugged in with is fairly long so you can put it wherever you need to. But you can also connect it to a power bank and take it out with you anywhere you want since it’s just a USB connection. And finally, I haven’t noticed any wobbling or loose parts yet. It is very sturdy. Doesn’t move around at all when I’m changing the heights or anything. And overall, it just seems to be made really well. It’s a great product. Please note: In my pictures, the first 6 are of the 3 different light settings (1 picture for lowest setting &amp; 1 for highest setting of each light color, so 2 pics per light color). The following pictures are just showing you some of the parts it came with like the remote and the control buttons for the ring light. And the last few pictures are just random. The ring light came with a nice soft case to carry it in if you choose to travel with it. It also came with an extra piece for your cell phone that screws on top where the ring light is if you choose to use this as ONLY a selfie stick (which they say it can be used for easily). If you’re familiar, the screw for the light and the cell phone mount piece at the top is just like the screws used for mounting a GoPro on a stand like this. So I think you could even mount a GoPro at the top (in place of the light) if you wanted to. And the last 4 pictures are just showing you the different height settings. I also included one picture of the back of the light which is just a plain black plastic material, and one picture of a standard plastic water bottle next to the light for easy size reference.<br/><br/>Please feel free to comment on my reviews if you have any questions at all. I check my notifications on here frequently and I’ll do my best to respond as fast as I can.<br/><br/>If you buy this, enjoy! Otherwise, you’re really missing out!! 🤙🏻</span>

<span>So far I have used this thing for months on end with a Sony a6600 camera on the pole provided and the mount provided. It gives off a decent amount of light and mounts to my desk just fine. It has held up perfectly with the weight of my camera and has improved my lighting significantly, especially on the days that I want to keep the office lights off but still use my camera.</span>

<span>I needed a light for filming short videos for my process blog. This is easy to use, has a variety of settings, the remote works well, and is lightweight.<br/>The only downside is it needs to be plugged in to work vs being rechargeable.</span>

<span>I had previously purchased a small stand and realized I needed the large one.

<span>My friend (who sells jewelry) has this same exact camera and we took a lot of great photos.  So, I bought the it and I didn't have it angled right for the first set of photos I took.  Also, the room lighting is a factor to keep in mind.  It's a fun camera and a good price.  Just be prepared to experiment with its placement and room lighting to look your best.</span>

<span>I bought these to use for product photography and they've worked well so far. I did notice after I got them that each light seems to have a slightly different color temperature (one warmer one cooler), not sure if they are suppose to be like that but it is what it is and hasn't bothered me. A few months after buying them one of the lights has started turning itself on seemingly randomly at night. Maybe I just have a ghost?<br/><br/>Overall would buy again and they're a good value for the money if you're not too picky about quality and just need some additional lighting. I do wish the cords were a little longer though.</span>

<span>The package arrived with one ball head. It doesn’t screws on neither of the tripods. Too bad I like the light but it’s crucial for this to be able to tilt it.  I will be requesting a ball head or return the whole thing.</span>

<span>These work well for the costs.  The dimmer switch is useful.  No problems with how they perform.<br/>Only thing I would change would be the height that they can go too.  A little short in my opinion.</span>
