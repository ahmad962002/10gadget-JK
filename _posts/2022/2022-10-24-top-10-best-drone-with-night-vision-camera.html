<span>I got one last Friday. The gimble didn’t work the camper as facing up. I sent it back and reordered it last night.  Today I got it. Put it to the test right away and it is just a lot of fun.  I like the Hover in place and it is super fast setting up the gps and Compass.<br/><br/>I had a very entry level drone I did t use often as the set up took half the battery.  This one sets up fast</span>

<span>Update: BWine offers extraordinary customer service! They have resolved the issue and went above and beyond my expectations! 5 stars for their level of customer care and satisfaction!<br/><br/>I’m hoping it was just a fluke after reading all of the other reviews, but after receiving the drone and getting the first flight in after initial setup and everything, the camera started smoking and fell off knocking the drone off balance and brought it crashing down! I immediately took the battery out and it stopped smoking in the camera area!</span>

<span>i'm 12 and I bought this drone with money that I saved and i am very happy with it. It is pretty easy to set up for a flight. it has a very good flight time and the camera quality is good. It folds very compact and the case is a good quality.  If there was one thing I would improve it would be the connection between the drone and a phone. It freezes up after you fly it half of the rated distance forcing the pilot to keep it in view. The GPS return to home is very accurate so that helps a lot when you can't see it and it freezes up. Overall very good product for the price. i would recommend.</span>

<span>Great drone for the amount of money. The quality of the camera / video is astonishing the only thing about the video is due to pricing of the drone when you change direction the camera is of course shaky. However the quality of the video is truly 4K and will blow your mind how far and clear the video is.<br/><br/>If you're looking to use this for video on the move definitely would recommend going for a higher priced drone for more gimbals and stability of the shoot. But just for messing around and learning this is an excellent drone with pretty decent range.<br/><br/>It has returned home every time it goes out of range, just a tip, make sure you don't fly it in areas that have power lines and obstacles like that cuz that's just asking for trouble.<br/><br/>Overall very satisfied for the price, I would buy it again and very much so recommend it for the beginning/middle enthusiast.</span>

<span>This is a great little drone with remarkable stability and control. The gps guidance is a plus. I had a glitch after a crash into a hedge after only a couple of weeks of flying and subsequently could not get the drone to respond. I called HolyStone and was given instructions to upload a video of the drone demonstrating the problem. When they saw the video, they contacted me they had already ordered a replacement that was on the way. This is the greatest customer service I have ever received from any vendor on Amazon. You just can't go wrong with this company and their product. If I ever need to upgrade to a more advanced drone, I will definitely do it with a HolyStone brand drone.</span>

<span>Originally started a review and was planning to give 4 stars however, now after having to work with customer service, I am updating to 5 stars as their customer service was fantastic.<br/><br/>I've owned a few less expensive drones and this one has been the best one I've owned yet.  Was easy to setup and easy to get the app installed and setup.  Love the size and makes it very portable.  The camera is far better than prior drones I've owned with "HD" cameras.<br/><br/>Very happy with battery life - was getting about 18-20 minutes each battery which is far better than 5 minutes I would get with my last drone.<br/><br/>The reason I needed to reach out to customer service was due to while flying the drone, the battery indicator in the app said had half a battery left and based on prior flying times, I knew I had about half the battery left. All of a sudden the app flashed critical battery, returning to home.  Unfortunately, rather than return to where the GPS had been calibrated, it took off and flew into some woods behind the property and into a tree a great distance from where it should have gone.  Customer service responded promptly and worked with me to talk through what occurred and what caused the issue.  They replaced the drone due to the malfunction (and very quickly I'd like to add, only a few days from the start of the communication to the new drone arriving).<br/><br/>All in all, very pleased with the purchase.  The drone does exactly what it says and I've had a lot of fun with it.  Great customer service is cherry on top.</span>

<span>After having the Ruko F11 Gim drone in my cart for a while and watching the price I finally jumped as it dropped due to a $70 coupon.  I bought the F11 Gim Drone on 2/10/2021, but due to the weather here in New England I really didn’t get to use the drone until the second week in March.  We have had lots of snow and wind and I didn’t want to fly my first drone in that weather not knowing its capabilities.  I was able to use the drone for about a week before I ultimately returned it due to my return window closing.  I would have liked more time with the drone to see if downfalls were outweighed by the positives, but it would have been an expensive keep if ultimately I didn’t enjoy it.  So in full disclosure, I no longer have this drone in my possession as it has been returned.<br/>I am just your average guy with a little R/C experience.  I have had some cars, toy copters, and an inexpensive mostly indoor mini drone.  I have been watching this drone because I wanted to get into a drone with good abilities at a decent price; all of which this drone meets. I really wanted a drone that did great still pics and good 4k video as I want to some day start a small business that would require arial footage.<br/>Let’s talk about some general things first:<br/>1. Never having flown a drone before it took me a while to figure out how to calibrate it before each flight.  Ultimately, watching a video from Ruko and looking at my phone during the calibration process (as it shows you what to do) made it easy.<br/>2. Not a pro or a con, but make sure you have a charger as one is not included.  Charging times vary depending on which wall brick you use.  I used a Samsung charging brick from my S8 and it took more than a few hours from low battery.<br/>3. I didn’t experience the “toilet bowl” effect mentioned in some review videos, but I didn’t have much time with the drone to see if that would happen.<br/>4. There is no collision avoidance.  This is not a con because you are paying for a drone that is half the price or more of other drones that have that feature.  It is something to note however if you are concerned with running into things.<br/>5. I didn’t have a chance to try out the different modes; follow me/rotate around/waypoint.  So, I really can’t comment on those, but there are video reviews out there on this.<br/>6. One battery was really enough for my flights, but maybe if the camera was better I would have flown longer, who knows.<br/>7. Max SD card is 128gig formatted in FAT32.  I could see where that might be a problem to some people, but I didn’t have an issue with it.  Sure, I’d like the ability to have a larger card in there, but this really is not a con to me.<br/>8. I didn’t get to try the return to home function, so I also can’t comment on how well that worked.<br/><br/>Pros of the F11 Gim:<br/>1. It comes in a great storage case that is well laid out and holds all the parts perfectly.  I was very appreciative of this as it kept everything I needed all together<br/>2. Easy to set up.  Everything you need is right there.  Just charge the batteries and the remote.<br/>3. Easy to connect to phone.  Following the directions, turn on the drone, then the remote and then the app.  Connect to Wi-Fi and you are good to go.<br/>4. The camera gimbal lets your rotate up and down.  This allows you to get interesting shots from different altitudes.<br/>5. It takes “4k” video….sort of<br/>6. Super easy to fly.  I flew in pretty gusty conditions and the drone worked great.  I was a little nervous as the winds really started kicking up, but the drone was still flyable<br/>7. 3 modes/speeds that are easy to change right on the controller.  Camera/Normal/Sport, each is progressively faster<br/>8. Beginner mode.  Limits the drone to 30m altitude and 30m distance.  You get a verbal warning when you try to fly out of that range and the drone quickly and abruptly returns to the 30m distance.  Once you are ready you can set the distance and altitude further and higher in one meter increments.  This really helps your ability to learn how to fly further and further out<br/>9. The controller was super comfortable to use.  It has plenty of features, but what I really liked were the two buttons and wheels on top of the controller.  The two buttons were for taking a photo and starting/stopping video.  This made it incredibly easy to do without taking my hands off the controls to reach for the app.  The wheels zoom in and rotate the camera up/down.  Also right in reach and super easy to use over the app.  Keeping your hands on the controls and being able to do this function was a huge positive.<br/>10. Can turn off GPS, but not recommended.<br/>11. Great battery life.  I feel like I flew for a long time and didn’t have an issue with battery draining out on me.  It was enough that I felt the flight time was adequate for what I was doing.<br/>12. I did like that the app tracked my flights and I could even see in google maps where I was.<br/><br/>Cons of the F11 Gim:<br/>1. The camera gimbal would go crazy at times.  It would move uncontrollably fast in all directions trying to maintain level I guess.  I would have to shut down the drone to get it back.<br/>2. Leveling the camera was very difficult.  Even on a flat surface the gimbal would stay tilted to one side and it would take either multiple times trying to calibrate or shutting the drone down and starting up again.<br/>3. My still shots were not that great.  I took shots on the move and holding the drone as still as possible.  But, it seems ANY sort of movement really made the shots look bad and blurry.  The still shots, even when not moving, didn’t seem that great of quality.  They seemed highly compressed.<br/>4. The “4k” video definitely looked better than 1080p, and it registers as 4k, but it doesn’t really look that great.  The video had lots of artifacts and looked VERY compressed especially as you got close to objects.  Video from 30m up looked okay, but just not a real 4k.  After doing some research my guess is that the camera is not a true 4k camera, but a 1080p that is upscaling at a low bit rate.  I can’t confirm that, but it definitely seems that way.<br/>5. When you take a still shot the app makes shows a radial countdown that freezes the screen for a few seconds.  This means that you only have line of sight on the drone.  If you are a distance away and not in line of sight, you don’t have any visual on what is happening until the picture is done.<br/>6. On one occasion I couldn’t get the GPS to lock in.  I am not sure if it was because my phone was low on battery or it was the drone.  I tried redoing the calibration multiple times in multiple spots without success.  I even swapped out to a new battery without luck.<br/>7. I tried to find a way to change the resolution of the camera, but it seems that it is locked.  There was no way to change the 4k to 1080p to see if it was any better.<br/><br/>My conclusion:<br/>In the end I returned the drone, but it was with great reservation as I really wanted more time and I really wanted to like the drone.  I didn’t have a chance to try out the different modes, follow me/rotate around/waypoints, as I had wanted.  In the end, even though the above pros outnumbered the cons, the camera issues were the deal breaker.  If the camera issues were addressed, I wouldn’t hesitate to buy this drone again and recommend it to anyone looking to get into the drone market.  I guess I want it all at an affordable price 😊</span>

<span>7/9/2021:<br/><br/>I'll start by saying what my considerations were going in to purchasing these drones.<br/>1. Must have GPS<br/>2. Must have RTH (Return to home) feature<br/>3. The App MUST work with my android devices.  This one is harder to get with some of the other drones I looked into which is one of the reasons I purchased this one.<br/>4. Must have gimbal camera for stable videos.<br/>5. Reasonably priced (not over $400).<br/><br/>The first one I ordered on 6/27/21, received a couple days later, was defective.  After a few minutes flight, lost both GPS and Controller signals from a short distance away, fortunately within 10 ft of the ground and flew into a tree trunk on its own.  Returned the day after it was received for a replacement.<br/><br/>The second drone was better, keeping a GPS signal lock and has not lost the controller signal.  I have flown it for over 6 hours so far (about an hour at a time).  I had to take an additional step to get it working correctly, as it would drift quite a bit when calibrated to directions and hovering without any wind to drive it.  After I took it out of GPS mode and put it in Trim mode, worked with it until it was hovering correctly, landed and put it back in GPS mode, it has flown much better since.<br/>I did encounter a different issue, however.  At around 150 ft high, it started flying in circles all on its own.  Pressing RTH did nothing but I was able to work with the controller until it started coming down in altitude and once below 30 meters, I was able to get the RTH feature to work again.  I find that to be disappointing as it is supposed to work much higher than that.  After seeing what this drone can really do,  I am sending it back.<br/><br/>The third drone has worked perfectly from the time I calibrated it.  I haven't gone higher than 200 ft as I can barely see it at that height and FAA rules is you must be able to see your drone (line of site).  It flies wonderfully, is very responsive and returned to “home” as it should when the button was pressed.<br/><br/>Pros:<br/>* My tablet was able to connect easily to the wifi of the drone.  The app is easy to use.<br/>* The video and pictures are much better quality than the Pro model, which is why I purchased this one.<br/>* The Gimbal worked just as it should, keeping the video stable as the drone moved around to compensate for any breeze that came up<br/>* It uses the same batteries as the Pro model and gives a pretty decent flight time, between 20 and 28 minutes depending on the conditions (wind, etc).  I got about 25 minutes on my first test flight.<br/>* Once calibrated AND trimmed (drone #2) , it was easy to fly and returned home just as it should when the button was pressed with one exception.<br/>* Dedicated video and picture buttons are easy to get to, along with the zoom and tilt dials which work well.<br/><br/>Cons:<br/>* 2nd drone had to be taken out of GPS mode and trimmed then put back into GPS mode to fly correctly. (The Pro model did not)<br/>*The controller, though it looks nice, lost some features from the Pro model.  It does not have an auto launch/land button, which I found to be useful on the Pro model.  I find it a hassle to have to find and use the app for this feature.<br/>*The App seems to be somewhat unstable, crashing randomly.<br/>* It does not have headless mode, which the Pro model has.<br/>* It uses 5 GHZ instead of 2.4.  5 is faster but more limited in range.  I found that the app video was stopping and starting while, the video on the sd card was good.  I don't see that on the Pro model.<br/><br/>Overall, my first impression is that they concentrated more on the camera / video quality when they upgraded the model,  than they did improving the drone as I feel the drone itself has not improved, but is more fussy to get set up than the earlier model and has more issues.  It is disappointing that it took 3 tries to finally get one that was right.</span>

<span>So I had recently had the F111 Pro which I loved but there was a freak accident and I lost it in a river so I saw this F11 GIM which seem to be an updated version of my drone so I thought I would get it and immediately I loved it. I love the fact that the camera isn't attached to the drone so no matter how much the drone moves the camera stays stationary and takes great pictures and video plus has a zoom feature.<br/><br/>I also like the new controller or transmitter if you call it that. The one for the F11 Pro sucked in my opinion it would never hold any of my phones with or without the cases. This one has held every phone that the previous one wouldn't and I've had no problems. I saw somewhere where a person mentioned the fact that you have to off-center your phone because of a button on the side. I don't know how they would make a holder to accommodate that since each phone is different but at any rate I'm happy with this phone holder.<br/><br/>I've only had one issue that nobody even Ruko could figure out. I flew it a few times when I first got it and calibrated it before flight. There was nothing that I did different really from the old drone but randomly every once in awhile I would hit the home button and it would start to return but then it would pass me and do these giant circles in the air. I had no control over the drone except go down but it was all over the place. At one point it headed away from down the block and I honestly thought I was going to lose it. I managed to get it down as best as I could without crashing it beyond repair. I flew it a few other times with no issue and then yet again it did the same thing and I managed to get it down but it crashed in my front porch.<br/><br/>Ruko sent me diagrams and videos but it was all stuff I was already doing and that I knew how to do so I returned it thinking maybe it was just a bad drone and got a replacement. So far I've flown it and haven't had any problems hitting the home button. Like I said it's random so it may happen still but as it stands everything seems to be okay.<br/><br/>I do notice with this one and the first one that after I connect to the drone before it says ready to fly it says GPS signal weak. It always does that no matter what even if I'm standing directly on top of it but then eventually it lets me calibrate it and is ready to fly. My F11 Pro never did any of these things. To be honest I'm scared to death to fly this new drone because I don't want to lose it or damage it because of this issue it's having. That's $300 I can't afford to just throw away. The F11 pro never scared me to fly it anywhere. Hopefully it was just a bad drone that I received and this one will not give me any problems but I've already told Ruko that if it does do that again I am sending it back and getting my F11 Pro back. At least I won't be scared of flying it nor losing it or crashing it. Other than that I think it would be a fantastic drone.</span>

<span> I got this drone for my wife real estate business plus fun for me and the kids. I got a cheaper drone before this and had to return due to shaky camera and it randomly take off in a direction.<br/>What I like:<br/>Great steady video<br/>Stable flight<br/>Once it gets going works great<br/><br/>The so so:<br/>Takes a bit to get setup and going<br/>Need a sd card for video (might be video to phone option but have not figured it out if there is)<br/>Batteries take 4.5 hours to charge each<br/>Took some googling to figure out how to power off remote (tap power button once than hold to power button to power off)</span>

The Assembly of the drone took literally 5 minutes outside of charging the batteries which they give you three full batteries.

<span> Our son has been flying smaller indoor drones and beginner outside drones with low image quality fixed cameras that were starting to collect dust on the garage shelves.  Replacing the batteries for these older models was a scavenger hunt on both the large auction site and amazon.  Both of us were ready to move up to the intermediate or non-professional level.  I selfishly selected this model to avoid the $500 to $1k price tag on those models in the warehouse club or yellow price tag electronics store.  So far this has been a great purchase and wanted to mention highlights that may not be getting the attention.<br/><br/>- Packaging:<br/>The professionally decorated white box has color stock photos of the drone with icons and graphics that list all the features and functions for the drone.  This looks like you purchased it at the retail outlets so it can be sent to others as a gift using a different address at checkout.<br/><br/>- Carrying Bag:<br/>The included bag is a great design and shape for both fashion and function.  The case is a stylish black and grey combination with an embossed XiL logo at the top flap just under the carrying handle.  Handle consists of a soft material where we slide our fingers and allows for a firm grasp to carry like a lunch box.  A shoulder strap option is available that clips on to the sides and can be carried over the shoulder or across the chest like a messenger bag.  The cut out molded inserts hold both batteries, the Drone, controller, and a spot for the detachable collision detection module.<br/>The inside pocket is the entire top flap that is mesh with a zipper at the upper 3/4 mark.  We keep the charging cable and tiny philips screwdriver in that pocket.  I also added a small flat head to the pocket to use for popping off the top section for the obstacle detection module.<br/>A nested zipper pocket is located on the outside to store the manual flat, some paper currency and a copy of our FAA UAS printed card.<br/><br/>- Charging:<br/>Both the remote and drone batteries charge using the industry standard microUSB to Type A cable.  No Wall adapter is provided but that is not an issue since I have so many portable power stations and wall plugs for all our recreational rechargeable battery powered devices.<br/><br/>- Startup and synch:<br/>Beginner drones have the quick up and down of the flight throttle to synch the remote to the drone.  Since this unit is more advanced it has additional steps.  The steps are not clearly marked on the remote so I decided to print some dynex labels for the camera upper right to perform the direction rotations, then the upper left for another calibration, and then the dual joystick movements to start the propellers ( only if the first two steps were completed correctly )<br/><br/>- Flight:<br/>We first started with only using the remote controller for our test flights.  Unfortunately we always against some wind but was able to still get some great flight training.  We learned both by trial and error along with asking questions on the product listing / email to manufacturer that in order to use the microSD card the app and smartphone has to be connected.<br/><br/>-App:<br/>The app provides a great birds eye view and additional functions that are not available on the manual rechargeable controller.  This controller has a great LCD display and the app provides even more stats and controls.  The app is the best method to capture photos and videos.  The Follow me mode and circle around a point is available when using the app.<br/><br/>-Camera and Gimbal protection:<br/>This is noteworthy since the gimbal has stabilization to prevent jello shaking effect and allows to move the camera direction while i flight.  With great functionality comes great liability of this portion to be damaged so this setup includes an easy to snap on / off protector that we keep in the zipper carrying bag when the drone is up in the air.</span>

<span>I received my RUKO F11 GIM2 Drone and was pleased with the delivery time (next day) and packaging.  Everything was received in perfect condition.  After unpacking everything I went through the process of reading through the user’s manual for proper setup of the drone.  I was very pleased with the quality of the drone and controls, the operating manuals, and the very nice case to store it in. They are very well made and appear to be exactly what I was wanting.<br/><br/>Before purchasing many of the things I buy I almost always read reviews and I rely heavily on them, which is the reason reason I am writing this review.  While charging the two batteries I received with the drone I noticed one battery had 3 blue lights and one pink light while the other battery had all blue lights.  I notified RUKO Customer Service, sent them a picture, and they immediately responded and are sending me a replacement battery.  For this reason I highly recommend RUKO, both for the quality of their products but also for the way they stand behind their merchandise and the way Customer Service responds so quickly and professionally.  Thank You RUKO!  Well Done!</span>

<span>As a beginner drone pilot, I found the drone was not too complicated to understand and I was able to get it in the air and try out some features rather easily.<br/><br/>Candy at customer service is top-notch.  I found a small issue with a screw in one of the arms, I emailed ROKU during the weekend and got a human response the same day.  After discussing the issue, Candy determined the best action was to send me a new drone arm.  I was very grateful in her quick response and decision.<br/>I have compared the RUKO F11 GIM 2 against a comparative model from Holy Stone, the HS720.  I found the RUKO stays in hover mode perfectly still giving the pilot a great picture taking platform. The HS720 wants to wonder around.  I found the ROKU to be a better UAS.<br/>I would highly recommend the ROKU F11 GIM 2</span>

<span>I love the case and the remote that came with the drone, overall I think its a pretty stable drone and have been enjoying flying it for the past month and a half, sometimes I have a lil bit of trouble getting a strong gps signal for takeoff, but that doesn’t happen that frequently, first couple flights I realized it needed landing gear to keep the blades in good shape, instead of mowing the grass, so I purchased a 3rd party landing gear that has been a life saver, no need to change blades now because of landing in grass, lifts it just the right amount of space off the ground. Wish there were more accessories available for it.</span>

<span>bought this drone to learn the basics of drone flight. loved it right out of the box. easy to control, easy to learn and easy to fly.<br/><br/>camera works great. it’s not professional quality and not mounted on a gimbal but you can’t expect that at this price point. the remote control does a great job of changing the angle of the camera and it all functions great.<br/><br/>the camera app was easy to download and figure out. it allows photos and video to be taken. using my smart phone as the viewer helps a lot. wish i had a set of googles but that’s nothing to do with the drone.<br/><br/>the remote does a good job of controlling the drone and has a place to mount your cellphone. more range would be great but again at this price what are you expecting. it does a good job and i’ve flown it out of visual site before. it came back fine.<br/><br/>it does struggle in wind. best to just keep it away when it’s strong enough to fly a kite.<br/><br/>had a great few weeks with it playing and learning. then i had an incident. i took it up to our property to see if i could get an aerial view of the land. it did great going out and flew against the wind. as the remote battery failed the drone veered off course and crashed into a tall pine tree. i couldn’t climb up and couldn’t even tell which tree it was in.<br/><br/>i had written this off as i couldn’t climb the tree and couldn’t recover the drone. fast forward 2 months. it’s a really windy day. i go to the base of the trees and actually see the drone sitting upside down on the ground. i couldn’t believe it.<br/><br/>i removed the battery. cleaned the corrosion off the contacts and took it inside. i changed remote batteries, charged up the spare battery and took the drone outside.<br/><br/>it still works!!!  2 months in a tree and this thing still functions great. i am currently charging the battery that was outside and all appears to be good to go.<br/><br/>i can’t believe this drone still functions after all i’ve put it through. i will definitely stick with this company in the future.</span>

<span>Fun device. Not saying it's not worth it, but realistically, for less than $100 compared to some for 4K it may not be what many might expect. Nonetheless, excellent training, for fun drone.<br/>One, if not the only reason I chose this device and model was the remote camera feature; difficult to find on drones for $100 or less. I wish it had lights for orientation. It's dark and easy to get lost from sight against a dark background. So I spent $5 on some LEDs that worked perfectly.<br/>However in spite of all this I was having trouble with my HS440 and contacted Support. They gave me instructions that made a huge difference. However, the initial problem persisted to some degree and eventually the device was inoperable.<br/>I contacted Support and they sent me a new device.<br/>That's not the end, though. Because I had a different problem with the second drone, they sent me a third. I can't believe it! They went above and beyond as far as I'm concerned. Love my new device, and grateful for awesome Customer Support from Holy Stone. Thanks for being awesome!</span>

<span>I guess you get what you paid for.  Originally 120, but got for 80 on a deal.  It's a great toy, but nothing else.  The camera range only streams up to about 50ft, after that the feed just dies.  Better hope you had eyes on it.</span>

Wider FOV to See the Bigger Picture Weighing less than 13 g, the 24mm equivalent lens not only supports autofocus, it also has an 84° FOV to capture more in every frame.  Focusing is Faster with VDAF Technology The Hasselblad camera on Mavic 3 drone features Vision Detection Auto Focus (VDAF) technology, which works with multiple vision sensors to utilize distance data and optimize focusing speed.  FHD High-Frame-Rate Transmission with Visible Smoothness Mavic 3 is DJI’s first-ever camera drone able to transmit a 1080p/60fps live feed. This means the camera view is displayed at specifications close to what the camera actually records. It also makes Mavic 3 more responsive to your control.  Note 1. Unobstructed, free of interference, and when FCC-compliant. Maximum flight range specification is a proxy for radio link strength and resilience. Always follow local rules and regulations and fly your drone within your visual line of sight unless otherwise permitted.  2. DJI Mavic 3 Cine supports Apple ProRes 422 HQ, Apple ProRes 422, Apple ProRes 422 LT, and H.264/H.265 encoding, while Mavic 3 only supports H.264/H.265 encoding.  FAQ 1. Compared to DJI Mavic 2, what major upgrades does Mavic 3 have?  DJI Mavic 3 is DJI's next-generation flagship consumer camera drone. Compared to Mavic 2, major upgrades include:  -Mavic 3 offers significantly improved imaging performance thanks to its 4/3 CMOS Hasselblad camera and 24mm-equivalent lightweight lens. It can record up to 5.1K/50fps or 4K/120fps videos.  -Mavic 3 Cine even supports Apple ProRes 422 HQ, Apple ProRes 422, and Apple ProRes 422 LT encoding, offering higher image quality and greater flexibility during post-processing.  -The flight experience has also been comprehensively improved with the flight time extended to 46 minutes. And thanks to incredibly stable O3+ technology, video transmission can reach up to 15 km.  -DJI Mavic 3 is equipped with an omnidirectional obstacle sensing system and supports the upgraded APAS 5.0 and Advanced RTH, letting creators enjoy safe flight with peace of mind.  2. What's the difference between the combos?  Compared with the standard Mavic 3 combo, DJI Mavic 3 Fly More Combo includes two additional Intelligent Flight Batteries, one Battery Charging Hub, one Convertible Carrying Bag, and one ND Filters Set (ND4/8/16/32) to help you explore and shoot in more scenarios.  Compared with the DJI Mavic 3 Fly More Combo, the DJI Mavic 3 Cine Premium Combo includes a Mavic 3 Cine aircraft that supports Apple ProRes 422 HQ, Apple ProRes 422, and Apple ProRes 422 LT encoding and has a built-in 1TB SSD, an upgraded DJI RC Pro with a high-bright display, one ND Filters Set (ND64/128/256/512), a 10Gbps Lightspeed cable, and other accessories that help facilitate professional-level imaging.

<span>I'm a huge fan of DJI but I am wondering about this release.  First it would not recognize any of it's sensors then it did.  It told me it was ready to fly.  So when i took off in the house to hover it went up about 2 feet and then went crazy and flew into the ceiling and went bat sh__ crazy.  VERY Dissatisfied<br/>2..... I ordered another and received yesterday.  After getting updates this thing is GREAT.  The video is great and very Cinematic.  No issues with this one at all.  I love it..... DJI fan again...</span>

<span>The controller that comes with this drone is the same one they include with the $449.00 Mini 2.<br/>If you want a better controller you need to spend another $1200.00<br/>If you want Care Refresh (DJI insurance) it's another $400.00 (a "Fly-Away" will set you back $729)<br/>So now you're paying $1149.00 total for your lost drone.<br/>So now Drone, RC Pro, 1 Extra Bat, ND Filter, Hub, Care Refresh, No Case comes to $4600.00<br/>I had problems with the Video Freezing on the Standard Controller while flying only 1000ft (or less) out.<br/>Very little interference where I was flying. RC Pro had the same issue. Multiple locations.<br/>The Drone itself flies great.<br/>The RC Pro is also awesome.<br/>Battery life is great.<br/>Now comes the first firmware update. Extremely slow GPS Locks. Sometimes taking 10 minutes.<br/>Before the update it would be ready in a minute, cold or warm GPS boot all locations.<br/>DJI had quite a few reports of issues on early firmware.<br/>New firmware now purposely waits for a more accurate GPS lock before it will let you fly.<br/>Many users think this is a Bug in new firmware, I'm sorry, but slow GPS lock is the FIX for problems in the hardware that were quite evident in the early firmware.<br/>This drone does NOT use the same GPS system prior Mavics used.<br/>Many users turn off Obstacle Avoidance, otherwise it might fly very erratic. This will hopefully get fixed in firmware. I didn't run into this issue.<br/>When I bought it I expected the lack of features that will come with new firmware. But I never expected this, not for this price point.<br/>Thank goodness for Amazon's generous Xmas extended return policy.</span>

<span>Zoom is wonderful.  I used it to film the rocket launches from the cape.  The pics I posted is the zoom settings.  no zoom. 7x and full zoom.  It was a hazy day so these pictures are not the clearest.  A no fly zone goes up when they shoot off a rocket and this is as close as I can get to the cape when it goes up.  Impressive zoom.  Other peoples reviews go into detail on specs but I will tell you that after flying drones for 7 years this is the drone to have.  Everything is top of the line.  For this model line and price this is as good as it gets.  Battery life is perfect.  I get so much time on this battery my legs hurt from standing.  I only have one battery though.  Extras battery's are very over prices but I guess I will get one someday.  With all the tech though this thing has an issue with roofs that slope up.  I got bit by a bug and when I went to smack it I pushed the controller slightly and the drone crashed on top of my house.  Totally my fault but I really thought the sensors would see it so I did not react as fast as I should have.  Nope.  It hit the house and flipped upside down.  I needed all new propellers and DJI does not give you a full set of replacements in the box.  They give you 50% of what you need for a full prop replacement.  Sad for what you pay.  My advice is to get a full set of OEM props.  I heard some after market props fly apart inflight.  Not what I want for 2000 bucks.  I will stick with OEM props.  Overall great drone.  It will require an FAA number for 5 bucks.  It is heavy.</span>

<span>UPDATE:<br/>Firmware and software updates have been released that were enough for me to possibly bring this review up to a 3.5. However, I bought the RC "PRO" for $1200 and among other problems I have with it, you can't even use it to adjust the shutter or aperture. LOL. $1200 for a pro remote for a pro drone and you can't even do the most basic pro thing, adjusting the shutter and aperture. On top of all that, it takes several minutes for the drone to grab enough satellites to turn green and set the home point. So we'll call it a wash and leave it at a 3.<br/><br/>I’ll start with this, there are a lot of people questioning if this is a worthy successor to the Mavic 2 and a lot of people questioning those people. The latter tend to say “you are not a professional, you don’t know how to use a drone, you are mad it is too expensive”.<br/><br/>Also, take all these 5-star reviews from people coming from Mini 2’s and Air 2’s with a grain of salt. They are coming from, in many ways, an inferior product. Yeah, the Mavic 3 is better than those for a lot of reasons and I understand why those users are pumped. But this drone was supposed to be an upgrade to the Mavic 2 and in many ways it is not.<br/><br/>I guess I’d call myself a semi-pro. I use my drone for photography and videography and sometimes make some money off it.<br/><br/>When I opened mine and removed it from the box, the lens cover was detached from the camera. I put it back on and as far as I can tell, nothing was damaged.<br/><br/>It should be common knowledge at this point that DJI rushed the drone out with unfinished features to get holiday sales. A firmware update was scheduled for January to add some of the missing features. An update was pushed out in mid-December and I had that update the first time I operated my drone. I believe another one is still coming out in January to add even more missing features. I don’t know what features those are and some of them might be what I take issue with below.<br/><br/>I don’t get the pro vs non-pro debate. It is priced at a pro-level and many proponents of the Mavic 3 argue that it is a pro drone … and I argue that yes I expected it to be. But then why on earth did they ship it with the controller used for the mini 2 and the air 2. It is missing so much from the Mavic 2 controller. No programmable C1, C2, and 5D buttons. No live telemetry LCD. No exposure dial. No dual controller support. Proponents and DJI need to make up their mind, is this a pro drone or not? If it is … shipping with this controller was a huge mistake and a slap in the face. I suspect they did this on purpose to force “pros” into dropping $1200 for the RC-Pro controller that has these buttons. Either way, Not cool.<br/><br/>I’ve heard a lot of complaining about the fly app … which is the same app used by the "non-pro" drones. I was hoping all of the whining about this was unfounded but it is indeed far inferior to DJI GO 4 and not suitable for a “pro” drone. Missing features *could* be added by DJI in the future but … who knows.<br/><br/>Hardware issues that cannot be resolved with software update:<br/><br/>1) Getting to the SD card is a huge pain. You have to take the battery out to get it out.<br/><br/>2) Can’t charge with the gimbal cover on<br/><br/>3) Unless you buy the Fly More (or buy the battery dock separately), there is no way to charge your battery outside of the drone (that said, being able to charge a battery in the drone is pretty neat).<br/><br/>5) The zoom lens is arguably one of the top selling points for this drone but it is a joke. Maybe it can be used to inspect things, but no photos or videos I took at a zoom are usable (maybe, just maybe 4x and 7x). I’d even be too embarrassed to post them on instagram. Also you have zero control over photos and videos on the zoom lens. Auto only mode and JPG only. Maybe fixable in a firmware update? Also, you can't do a full 1x-28x or vice versa smoothly, at one or two points the recording blacks out (while switching lenses?) It is also near impossible to zoom with your finger on the app and do other things smoothly (especially if you have a hood on your tablet), which is the only way to do it unless you shelled out the extra 1200 for the “pro” controller.<br/><br/>5) Gimbal rubs against arms when folded up<br/><br/>6) No dual controller support (maybe this could be a firmware update?)<br/><br/>Issues that I found right off that bat that might be able to be updated in firmware if DJI chose to do so (that hands down should be available in a pro drone)<br/><br/>1) No color graded preview for DLOG on your tablet/phone.<br/>2) On the Mavic 2 you could tilt the camera a decent amount to the left or right. This only moves a silly amount.<br/>3) DJI does not intend to include waypoints in a future firmware update<br/>4) No SDK, so no Litchi and no Drone Deploy<br/>5) Photos snapped are not cached on device<br/>6) No recording of sound in cached videos (I liked to have this enabled in case someone approached me while operating and I could have an audio record)<br/><br/>A top selling point for the drone is the bigger sensor and the higher video resolutions and framerates. Not much to say here, more is better. 4k at 60 and 120 fps, yes please. 5.1k yes please! I feel like this is finally an argument that this is a pro drone. As mentioned above, users coming from the mini 2 and air 2 have reason to be very excited about this but I struggle to see a noticeable improvement in photo quality from the Mavic 2 Pro. Also, I take issue with 4k 120 fps being under a different menu option.<br/><br/>Random thing I learned …  Hasselblad is no longer a real company. I guess they got pushed out due to not being able to keep up with technology and DJI bought them and just slapped their logo on the camera. So, the Hasselblad branding is pretty much a giant nothing burger.<br/><br/>The drone itself looks cool and I like the new battery design (except for having to remove it to remove the sd card). The "gimp"bal cover is kind of weird, still getting used to that. I like how you have pretty much full control over custom settings for the 3 modes, cine, sport, and normal. I do feel the video feed coming back from the drone to my ipad looks smoother and higher quality.<br/><br/>In summary, I had such high hopes for this drone but they clearly rushed it out (I really hope most of these gripes will be resolved in updates soon). It seems most of the people super hyped about it are coming from the min 2 and air 2, not the Mavic 2. For the amount I paid, I’d expect the zoom lens and the (base) controller to be more functional and an app with far fewer missing features from DJI GO 4.<br/><br/>Honestly if you already have a Mavic 2 this really might not be worth it to you,  especially if you don’t make money off of your drone. But then again, if you make money off your drone using waypoints, Litchi, or Drone Deploy, you can’t even use those right now... In its current state, this is a 3-star drone. If they fix a lot of stuff in firmware and Fly updates, it can be a 4-star drone. It pains me to say this, but I don’t think it can ever be a 5.</span>

<span>This is not an Eachine E58 drone! Don't be fooled like I was. That being said it is pretty good beginners drone, it comes with two batteries and a nice case, prop guards and spare props. However it is deceptively marketed as an unbranded E58 drone and not the Eachine E58 drone which is a much better unit. I ordered replacement parts for an Eachine E58 and of course they do not fit this cheaper drone.

<span>The instructions to this are very vague, it tells u how to pair the remote, which apparently u must do every time u use it, and that’s pretty much it. I can’t hardly get it to take off and when I do I can’t control it. I do t kno if the remote control are backwards from the way they go, don’t even kno what all the buttons on the remote do! It has a QR code to down load an app but I can’t figure it out either. It seems like it would be a fun toy if I could figure out how to use it I will say it’s very durable considering how many times it has crashed into the ground and still works,</span>
