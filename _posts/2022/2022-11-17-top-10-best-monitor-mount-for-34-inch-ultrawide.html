<span>I purchased multiple monitor stands and they are identical to my Ergotron branded model.<br/><br/>The package includes all tools required to install and adjust the arm.<br/><br/>I attached a 34" UW monitor to it and it required no adjustment. It's sturdy and does not wobble at all.<br/><br/>I have no complaints and the price was fantastic. I can only hope that they offer these again.</span>

<span>I bought a cheaper one before but it didn’t quite work out for my Wacom screen. I constantly need to move my Wacom screen when I need to sketch so I needed something that really listened to me. The cheaper ones just tend to retract back to an unwanted position and they just don’t listen. Glad I bought this one cuss if freaked listens to me!</span>

<span>I love this monitor mount! Very strong, very flexible, and by far my favorite one I've used. If you are looking for a permanent setup solution, this is a great option! I have purchased 2 so far and may be buying 2 more.<br/><br/>I have a 2 PC setup with 4 monitors altogether. I needed a way to mount the monitors to save on space, but also be flexible to the space they needed to populate. I purchased this mount and another one at the same time to try and solve the problem. After using both it was very clear this mount was the better option. So, I bought another one!<br/><br/>The instructions on the mount installation were very clear and it was very easy. I am using the mounts in 2 spots on the same wall for a 32 inch monitor and a 27 inch monitor in a portrait orientation. I love how maneuverable they are and has been the perfect solution for my standing desk.</span>

<span>Installed on a 27-inch gaming monitor. Instructions were a little confusing at first because some parts already assembled and the illustrations for the tension screws are small and confusing to locate. One tension screw was hard to locate at first, see pic it is just below the sticker, have to stick the tension tool through hole and twist left or right. I left the stickers on so easier to locate the tension screws.<br/><br/>It tilts, swivels (360), has portrait/landscape mode (360) and can move up down. Well-built and attractive design. The 2 little screws to tighten the base are easy to overlook. The cable management was ok but the 2 straps to hook the cables from sagging was tacky and difficult to reach if need to make adjustments after you put the arm together.</span>

<span>This is the third one I have purchased.  For the price it will be hard to beat.  All three have 32" monitors on them, and they are all holding up well.  I did not use the clamping system, so I don't know how sturdy that would be, as I have drilled and mounted it to the table itself. So far so good, I have no complaints.</span>

<span>Wanting room to stow a laptop under my monitor, and to create a one cable swap over of all my desk-things between desktop and laptop, I found myself looking for a monitor arm.<br/><br/>Assembly was pretty simple, although the instructions could do with a better "Which pieces are which an what ya need" view. In particular some advance note about the different pieces for installing with the C-clamp versus drilling a hole. But I love that it has a fitting on the arm for the three Alan wrenches.<br/><br/>Movement is as advertised. You can adjust vertically, but don't expect to do this without getting up and loosing and tightening the bolt. Horizontal adjustments are easy, and you probably can't ask for better unless you want a worm like telescoping arm instead of a study support arm. The included cable management pieces clip to the H-arm and work great for all my cables, and if they ever break, the arm is the right size that I could apply (medium/large) binder clips as a replacement or augment.<br/><br/>Plus, it supports my 32" LG/4K monitor just fine :D.<br/><br/>Since most of us don't adjust our monitor positions very much once getting it just right, this works really well. It's quite stable and horizontal adjustments are easy. Great value for the price, IMHO.<br/><br/>It also solves my problem of wanting room for my laptop under the monitor, and I can swing it out horizontally to access the cables. That's so much nicer than having to drag a monitor on a standout whenever you need to change the cable management, whether that's adding/removing/replacing equipment or simply wanting to clean and dust. As someone who opted to velcro USB hubs and a small Ethernet switch to the back of my monitor instead of buying an more expensive monitor with integrated USB things, I really apricate this arm's cable management vs my monitor's stand.</span>

<span>TLDR: Experienced installer, and I chose this mount for my personal office for its ease of installation and its sturdiness. For any monitor mounting operation, careful thought and planning is required, and this mount solves more headaches than is causes.<br/><br/>I read over several reviews of this product prior to purchase. I've seen many that offer criticism of their sturdiness and various other features, but I feel most of them are unfounded.<br/><br/>My first purchase was for work... about 20 of the shorter dual monitor mount by the same company. When we installed them, they easily held the 32 and 27 inch monitor pairs we were attaching to them. Mounting any monitor of this size can be difficult, but with a little patience, all 40 monitors were mounted, aligned and ready to go. After installation, they were quite well fixed in place, and we have had no problems in the year since we bought them. No signs of joints getting weaker, or mounts leaning over or any of that in all that time.<br/><br/>Of course, when it came time to by for my home setup, I looked for the same company. I bought 2 of these mounts, which are higher, so that I could elevate 2 heavier 24 inch monitors above an ultra-wide monitor which will reside below.  Even at their highest setting, which provides the most stress to the mount, I found them to be quite firm in their support. When I wiggle my desk (within reason) I get no more than 1/4th to 1/2 of an inch in deflection; nothing that appears dangerous. And trust me, there is no way I would mount 2 cheap monitors over my quite expensive ultra wide monitor if I did not feel they were sturdy enough.<br/><br/>A couple tips on setting them up.<br/><br/>Do NOT place anything in the clamp other than the surface of your desk. If you are worried about marring your desk, you likely should be looking for a floor or wall mount. The rubber grommet included for inside the clamp is not meant to protect your desk, but rather to act as a shock absorber to the system. It will provide some protection to the top surface, but do you really want to be clamping something to a really expensive desk? If you install it, and your mount is leaning, you either did not tighten it enough (this one will squeeze to nothing if adjusted right) or your desk is not sturdy enough to hold the mount. When properly adjusted, a gentle shake of the desk should cause a slight rocking, but nothing should be out of place when they stop.<br/><br/>Attach the monitor to the mounting plate, but do not attach the mounting plate to the extension arm until after the extension arm is attached to the vertical support. It says the opposite in the instructions, but if you lock the extension arm in place firmly, it is safer and easier to do it my way.<br/><br/>I did knock off one star on the range of movement. Each joint allows only a 90 degree bend. This somewhat limits some of your options, but should not preclude any use case you might have in mind. It just means you might have to think about it a bit as you install it. I did not feel this affects the use of the mount enough to have it affect the overall rating. In fact, it likely is a trade off which contributes to the sturdiness of the mount. This mount does provide a reasonable throw, which is the length of the extension arm in this case. If you need more than this one provides, you likely need to look at a spring loaded mount. Throw in this case is the horizontal distance a mount can place the center of the monitor from the mounting location.<br/><br/>Besides sturdiness, the ease of installation is of note. I've mounted hundreds of monitors and this one is quite strait forward. You have enough factors going for an installation, and extra doodads that provide little function are not appreciated. This one fits the bill nicely. This extends to the cable control devices, which are critical if you don't want to slice a cable in half.<br/><br/>All in all, a good, but simple mount with reasonable throw and good sturdy construction. A++</span>

<span>Love this arm.  Hold my 49" monitor great.  But after I installed it, it didn't want to hold the monitor up.  The monitor, being heavy, wouldn't stay where I put it, it wanted to drop to the desk.  It wasn't until I did an internet search and found a YouTube video that I realized there is a hidden screw you tighten that makes the arm joint stiffer, so it will hold up the weight of the monitor and doesn't lower after you adjust it and let go.  This screw/adjustment is not mentioned in the instructions.  Major goof up by the company, as it ends up being the most important thing you need to know about using this arm.  I wonder how many of these were returned as "Doesn't work as advertised" all because of this one omission...  But now I love this thing, since I figured out how to adjust it!</span>

<span>1) This IS able to rotate 360 degrees at the base!<br/><br/>I just want to put that first because of the huge amount of misinformation in the comments.  There is a set screw you need to back off at the base. It's very easy to do and the only reason it exists is to prevent it from being knocked into a wall if the desk is flush.<br/><br/>The other complaint I see is the fact the monitor rotates from landscape to portrait too easily.  While this is true, there is a set screw that can be placed to prevent it from rotating in that way at all, which I'm assuming is 99% of people's preference, strange it isn't installed by default.<br/><br/>2) The quality of this thing is astounding.  I was truly shocked as I removed it from the packaging.  Is it $400 worth of quality? Hard to say.  I know I'd have purchased it much sooner if it was $250 instead but I can't see how the material and built could be any better. They definitely don't cut corners.<br/><br/>3) This was very easy to set up.  You WILL need to remove the monitor to make any adjustments to location or if you don't get the pieces seated properly, and obviously that is a task for 2 people.  It can be a little unnerving but that's just the nature of dealing with something the size of a G9 or similar.<br/><br/>I would buy this again, and I wouldn't wait as long as I did the first time.</span>

<blockquote><em><div class="a-row a-spacing-small review-data"><span class="a-size-base review-text review-text-content" data-hook="review-body">
<span>To begin with, this is obviously a very well built product with quality parts, as it would have to be to support a monitor like the G9 (as I'm using). Further, there's very little wiggle and it keeps its position very well. So kudos, it does the main job well.<br/><br/>But... the price is exorbitant. A basic monitor arm costs literally one tenth the price, there's absolutely no way this requires ten times the materials or engineering, you are definitely paying for both the brand name and the fact that no one else (that I know of) makes a stand with this weight capacity. Supply and demand, I guess, but the stand that comes with the G9 is so excellent I really question if I made the right choice.<br/><br/>Assembly is pretty straightforward, though if you have the G9 you will definitely want a second pair of hands actually lift it onto the mount.<br/><br/>Adjustment in all directions works well enough but it really wants to move in some ways more than others. For example, it rotates (the one adjustment I never want to make) far too easily so I'm always leveling back out after moving it. And of the three main pivots, the middle one moves much more easily than the other two so actually moving it backwards and forwards it is a matter of swinging it side to side until you can get each pivot to move the way you want. It takes a good 30-60 seconds of wiggling just to push it back. Maybe this is unavoidable due to the monitor weight, but don't think this is something you can just adjust on a whim.<br/><br/>Also, the depth adjustment is surprisingly short. I measured a measly 18cm of range - they advertise more, but that requires pushing it off to one side which isn't going to be a good option for most people. This is partly because the main pivot where it meets the desk is limited to 180 degrees from left to right, not ~360 as you might expect. It's puzzling because you can rotate it the full 360 by removing the set screw and it seems to operate just fine, but obviously that's risky to do without knowing why they limited it in the first place. If someone from Ergotron reads this, I'd love to know why it's limited and how dangerous it is to use without the screw.<br/><br/>Finally, the cable management is, as always from Ergotron, hugely disappointing. I can't believe they still don't make this a priority. There's ways they route cables: first, two little velcro strips that are ugly, hard to close neatly, and tend to come out and are a huge headache to get back in. Worse, they don't even hide the cables! It's the cheapest, laziest solution imaginable. The other is a cavity on the rear arm that's covered by a plastic sheath. This at least looks nice once they're tucked in, though doing so is a pain and getting the plastic part on an off is rather tricky. I don't exaggerate when I say I've bought sub-$50 monitor arms with more elegant and thoughtful cable management solutions. Figure it out, Ergotron! I'm paying you way too much for this malarky!</span>

<span>This dual monitor mount was a big upgrade from my previous WFH setup. The monitors dont wiggle around when moving my desk up and down. The are fully adjustable so I can turn one 90° or stack them depending on what I'm working on.<br/>The only thing I wish that was better was the cable management going to the monitor itself. There is a little bit from the main arm to the secondary arm but after that you get nothing.<br/>One thing I didn't realize was how much I was going to need to pull my desk away from the wall. I have 27" curved monitors and due to this the arms had to be bent in towards one another to get the correct spacing. These bends forced me to push my desk away from the wall about 9". If you have larger monitors this wont make as big of difference though.</span>

<span>I absolutely absolutely FREAKING LOVE THIS ARM. I bought it as soon as I found out we'd be working from home for a while, in an effort to finally upgrade my home setup. After I bought it I mentioned it to a friend, and she said "YES!!! I HAVE THE SAME ONE AND I LOVE IT!!" I've only had it for a couple of months, but my friend has had hers for years and it's still going strong.<br/><br/>I have an enormous Cintiq - 24HD Touch. I was warned that if the weight of the screen to be supported is too close to the weight limit, it probably won't work well, and this was literally the only arm I could find that was rated to support my monster! Not only does it hold the weight of my Cintiq beautifully, the motion is smooth and effortless, only a very slight wobble, and I can lean on it pretty hard without it going down. It's a little tricky sometimes to get the wrench-key into the right spot for adjusting the tension, and every person will prefer something a little different - but once you get the hang of it it's a no brainer. Installation itself was easy and instructions were clear. The only difficulty was lifting my Cintiq onto the arm once it's all assembled, because the dumb thing is so darn heavy it would have been nice to have a second pair of hands... but that's not the arm's fault!<br/><br/>Ergotron is the standard in the entertainment/arts industry for a reason. I'm an artist, so aesthetics matter, and it has to function all day long every day.  I COULD NOT be more pleased. I'm an extremely tactile and picky person I got the polished aluminum one and I have to say, it's actually beautiful. It doesn't have that "ergonomic tech" look that a lot of other "ergo" products have, which I think is pretty tacky and wanna-be futuristic. This thing though... this is a beautiful and sturdy piece of engineering and it performs it's function to perfection. THANK YOU ERGOTRON.<br/><br/>My desk is 30" deep and it reaches well beyond the edge from the back, but I have it mounted to one side and it works just fine there too. This is such a massive improvement over the piece of crap stand that the last few models of Cintiqs have come with (the one that only has two positions to choose from, is difficult to adjust, and weighs a freaking ton), it's just night and day.<br/><br/>It's rare that I am so dang chuffed over a purchase that I feel COMPELLED to review it, but this one dear god was completely worth it. Improved my workspace 1000% times over and I'm pleased every time I see it and grateful every time I use it!  What a spectacular piece of equipment!!!!</span>

<span>This monitor arm is extremely well made, durable and a lot more heavy then I thought it would be.  So, overall the construction of the arm and it's design is very well made, heavy solid materials.  It comes shipped in a great packaging, it's nice to see care in how much care went into packing.  The assembly is relatively easy with just 3 parts that connect with a few screws to tighten.  I'm using this arm with an LG 38" Ultra Wide monitor that I believe is about 15lbs in weight and it can easily move around without struggle on the arm.<br/><br/>If you have a lighter monitor or a smaller sized one, you may have difficulty with the arm keeping a monitor in a low position.  If the monitor is light weight &lt; 12-13lbs it may want to lift up on it's own due to the heavy spring action.  I had a smaller monitor on it while waiting for my ultra-wide and it was kind of comical.  I added weight to the monitor to keep it down a bit.<br/><br/>It supports VESA 100x100 and 200x200 on the mounting bracket.  I feel like this is a good standard for newer monitors.  The mount is sturdy and supports a really good range of movement tilting up and down as well as a full rotation on it's side.  The arm movement is really reasonable in it's range of movement.  I'm even able to drop my monitor down a bit lower than the clamp.<br/><br/>The arm assembly also includes options to mount the arm with a desk clamp, or through a drilled hole.  It has good options for mounting the arm as needed.<br/><br/>I'm really satisfied with this purchase and can see this arm lasting a really long time - probably much longer than my new monitor.  I highly recommend getting it.</span>

<span>I had reservations of any mount that was not drilled in to the desktop, in holding my 49 inch monitor.  However, I have found that this mount not only securely holds this heavy monitor, but also does a phenomenal job of holding every adjustment that I make to it in terms of height, etc.  It is expensive, but having lost my last "gaming" monitor to a bad mount, I have no problem spending the extra money to ensure that does not happen again.<br/><br/>The built in cable management is nice, but I have enough cables, and thick HDMI cables coming out of it that kept popping the cover off of the arm.  So, I wrapped the cables and that part just hangs.  This is not a big deal to me because the mount accomplishes the desired task, but may be annoying to others.</span>

<span>TL;DR<br/>For those searching for dual monitor arms that are of quality and do what they are suppose to do, stop your search and purchase this one! :)<br/><br/>After extensive research and finally talking with our onsite AVI-SPL guys about what to buy that would support my two monitor's weight (ASUS MG28UQ - roughly 17lbs each) I was led to this product.<br/><br/>Below I will list out my use case and how this product met or exceeded my expectations.<br/><br/>Desk-to-Wall Spacing<br/>My primary concern was the need to find arms that would work with a L shaped desk that is located in a corner of my office facing the wall. I have approximately 4" from the back edge of my desk to the wall. The installation method I went with was the clamp and I still have roughly 2" of clearance and as far as I would ever need, plenty of room to maneuver the arms.<br/><br/>Weight Limits<br/>The current monitors I use are the Asus MG28UQs. These monitors are 28" and are significantly heavy. Tightening the arms to counterbalance the weight of the monitors was easy enough to do with the provided Allen Wrench.<br/><br/>Range of Motion<br/>I was looking for arms that would support quick switching from horizontal to portrait with ease. These arms do just that and are easy to level out. As for distance from keyboard or front edge of my desk, these arms allow me to push my monitor where the front of the screen is roughly 6" from the wall giving me the full capacity of my desk space.<br/><br/>Overall, this has been a great product and worth the price.</span>

<span>I really like the Kensington dual monitor arms. I have one 32" and one 24" monitor.<br/><br/>Like with other reviews, I had to adjust the bolts on the arms to take the weight of the monitors turning the bolt left to hold more weight on the arm (photo) bolt and to the right on the other bolt near the monitor.<br/><br/>I have it attached to an Ergotron corner desk converter, and it's working well. So pleased!</span>

<span>Just purchased my second of these stands - I love them! For the price, they cannot be beat. They're very sturdy and hold my 32" curved monitor with ease. Assembly is very simple. Functionality is great. I'm especially pleased with the swivel feature as it is not easy to turn my monitor out of the way when I don't need it. Best yet, I was missing a part in the box with my second stand and I contacted Vivo customer service via the email address on the directions. They emailed me back within an hour or so and a replacement part was on the way later that day.</span>

<span>I have a 32-inch 15-pound monitor I needed a stand for. Since I wasn't planning on needing to swing the monitor into different positions, I didn't feel a monitor arm was needed. This stand does a great job of holding my monitor. Very sturdy. It can tilt back and forth, and side to side. The height can be adjusted though the height adjustment is firmly held by a tightener. Once set, the height can't be adjusted by lifting up or pushing down on the monitor. The stand allows the monitor to swivel, but that's not very practical since the monitor would have to stay at a fairly high height, which likely isn't what you want for when the monitor is horizontal. The height can be changed, but that would require reaching around to the back and using an Alen wrench to loosen the clamp, then adjust the clamp height and then use the wrench again to tighten the clamp. Perhaps the clamp could be left loose enough for sliding, but I wouldn't be comfortable with that, and I don't need to swivel my 32-inch monitor anyway.<br/><br/>But, it does all that I want, it is very stable, and it's at a good price. For me, it's a keeper.</span>

<span>I have been suffering from neck and shoulder pain for years. That pain had reduced by capacity to work greatly, and gradually crept up on me, worsening year by year, decreasing my income.  Physical therapy provided limited help unfortunately, and while massages helped, they were expensive, time consuming, and merely provided temporary relief.  In about a week, I have noticed a sudden decrease in my upper back/neck pain.  I am excited and hopeful for the future.</span>

<span>WHY I BOUGHT THIS:<br/><br/>I originally wanted to mount my monitor (Dell D3218HN, pretty heavy 32 inch monitor that pretty much pushes the boundaries on what the description says this stand can hold) on an arm, an expensive one too, but my desk was just too thick for a clamp to work and I was not about to drill a hole through it. I wanted to easily switch between portrait and landscape mode, while also having enough motion to swivel the screen around so others could see the screen if they needed. The included base for my monitor didn't allow for any kind of movement in any direction at all.<br/><br/>After seeing that an arm wouldn't work, I tried looking around to see if there were any base replacements that allowed me to do the same thing, except as a standing piece instead of an arm.  There weren't many options out there, and this one ended up being one of the cheapest options I could find. I figured if it sucked, no harm would be done at this price, and even if I liked it I wouldn't be bothered by replacing it with an arm later on for the same reason. This thing is insanely inexpensive for what it is, to me at least. It came in both black and white, which was perfect for my white monitor.<br/><br/>SETUP/WEEK OF USE:<br/><br/>Taking this out of the box and putting it together was incredibly simple. I had it out of the box and fully assembled (not attaching the screen) in less than 10 minutes. It looked like it was going to be complicated until I realized the majority of what was in there was extra parts for the most part. There were no scratches, dings, or imperfections on any surface of this thing, which would look very obvious on the white version. The welds holding some pieces together, which aren't visible when put together, looked very crappy and cheap but not enough to really make me nervous about its integrity.<br/><br/>Sliding the monitor into place was fine but screwing the thumb screw that holds them together was a little awkward and required a few attempts to screw it in correctly (it goes in at an odd angle and the plate connected to the monitor has to be held a certain way for the hole to line up, no big deal) and tightening all the screws down with the supplied tools was simple enough for me to do without needing anyone to hold the monitor up, although some of them required a LOT!!! of force to tighten down, which I had to do in order for this thing to hold my chunky monitor up. I can still rotate and swivel it no problem, it just really had to be tightened quite hard to not sag.<br/><br/>The one thing I had a major issue with during setup though, was the part that connects to the pole that would allow you to adjust the height. It's pretty much a plastic ring inside a metal ring that gets tightened around the pole, and adjusting the height is just sliding this ring up and down the pole. This mechanism is frankly absolutely horrible. This was very frustrating to set up because if I tightened it enough to hold my monitor up without sliding back down on its own, it was simply too tight to be able to comfortably adjust or even really move at all when it came to height adjustment, but loosening it even a little would cause my monitor to slide right back down, scary fast sometimes. I had to very precariously hold the monitor by the mechanism connecting the stand to the back of it and have it lifted to the height I wanted it to be at with one hand while using a huge amount of force trying to tighten this screw using an Allen wrench with the other hand. I was definitely pretty sweaty by the end of this. Again, this monitor is on the maximum end of the weight/size they recommend, so I understand this might be a me problem. I left it at the highest it can be at, since this size monitor needs to be that way anyways in order to rotate completely without hitting the table, and tightened it to "F you" levels and decided that this stand adjusts in every direction but in height. Totally fine with me, but I removed a star in ease of assembly for that since it's a feature that could and should be a little better that I can't use because it isn't.<br/><br/>Over all, after that setup it's a very sturdy and attractive stand. Kind of a huge base, but if that means it isn't falling over I'm fine with it. It wobbles a little when the desk does, but pretty much any stand or arm will to this amount. Swiveling and rotating this monitor is surprisingly smooth and completely silent, no huge amounts of force needed and no creaking/grinding noises, little to no wobbling even! It just works exactly as you'd want it to, aside from the height adjustment that is. The built in Allen wrench holder that also doubles as a cable routing system at the same time is very very simple and clean and useful. I will never lose these important (though very standard and easily replaceable) tools and my monitor and peripheral cables look cleaner than it did before. It doesn't detract from the look at all and actually cleans it up a bit.<br/><br/>The final verdict here is that in most circumstances, this thing is an absolute no-brainer and a steal for the price and is an excellent upgrade from most default monitor stands. I bet that if you had a monitor that isn't testing their claims of exactly how heavy and large a monitor it can ACTUALLY hold, you may not even have the singular problem I had. It's astounding that this is only $25-$30. If you need something like this and your monitor is 32 inches or smaller, GET THIS ONE!</span>

<span>This wall mount offered the best articulation for my needs. The high point is the screen tilt range. Most other wall mounts only do 5° forward and 15° back. Since I'm not using it for work/desk needs and instead in my room for movies and gaming, the tilt range on this one is amazing.<br/><br/>The frame itself is sturdy material and of sound construction. The articulation joints are easy to adjust and manipulate.<br/><br/>There are just a couple down sides:<br/>•I'm not a huge fan of the angle of the sections at the elbow joint but the screen tilt more than compensates for that.<br/><br/>•My thin, curved, borderless 24" monitor (Scepter) isn't actually heavy enough to activate the elbow articulation piston, which is really hard to manipulate by hand when the arm isn't yet connected to the wall. There isn't a way to adjust the pressure of the piston, unfortunately.<br/>Once I had the thing mounted and attached the monitor, I had to add a 3lb weight to the end of the arm to get the piston articulation to function as intended.<br/><br/>Otherwise, I'm pretty content with my purchase. This is the 2nd one I bought after sending a different kind/brand back.</span>
