<span>I bought one of these, hadn’t had it two months ad it quit working! Talking to A representative of Amazon she said I would have to send it back to the manufacturer and she put a call. Into them for me! He gave me instructions on how to send it back to them, and I did!  It’s been almost a month and I’ve heard nothing from them on this matter! It cost 32dollars to send it back to them!  Will never buy anything else  from Amazon!</span>

<span>Where to start?  Some of the reviews on this item were glowing and some were skeptical.  I decided to give this Whistler backup cam a try.  The solar tech and cable-free install seemed promising.  I bought this in early March, but didn't have time to setup due to time constraints.  When the pandemic hit, I had ample time to sit down, read the manual, and try to get this up and running.  First, to my dismay, the package was missing parts.  My package was missing four of the spacer discs.  I still went ahead and tried to take it in stride and make it work.  But, secondly, the USB port on the unit is placed in a very inaccessible position near one of the vertical screw linings.  Once a USB cable goes in there for the initial charge, it is very difficult to remove.  I had to use pliers to get it out.  Third, the model number is listed on box and listing as the 1000 model.  The stickers on the actual unit says it is the 900 model.  So, that is a mixup as well.<br/><br/>I charged the base for the recommended time, linked the solar cables, and headed out to the car to do the install.  Manual says test connection first before installing.  So, I did.  It turned on and paired automatically.  The connection faded in and out though.  The picture quality was blurry and not sharp.  Then, the picture on the monitor didn't come back on after the monitor was turned off.  I tried any and all combination of button presses.  It just died!  Just like that.  I'm glad Amazon extended the return period, because this piece of junk is going back.  I would not recommend this or any other backup cameras from Whistler as they are not proven to last over time and it is quite obvious several folks on here got lemons.  In short, buying this product was a huge letdown!</span>

<span>I was really hesitant about ordering the Wireless  backup camera, but I was really surprised when it worked flawlessly.<br/>I do have some suggestions for the manufacturer. Connecting the four cables on the back of the license plate frame isn't very easy because  the sockets and plugs aren't keyed. One just has to hope that they're connected correctly.<br/>Also, I'd really like a larger screen display. It's bright and colorful but just a little too small.<br/>But this is the first time I've found  a device like this that REALLY works well and was pretty easy to install.</span>

<span>Great picture quality. However would not transmit from rear of FJ Cruiser and work. After some experimenting in different locations I ended up disassembling the camera/solar units from holder and affixed to the roof rack. Works great now except for seeing the first two feet from rear bumper. Great idea, weak in execution.</span>

<span>I bought this backup camera 3 times from Amazon, 2 used and one brand new. I’m not gonna say anything about the first used one since I didn’t even receive it (it’s lost). The second used one I received had no charging cable for the backup camera. I could understand since it was a used, but I realized the backup camera was not even charging and it’s not pairing with the monitor. I still don’t know it was because an issue with wireless connection between the monitor and the camera or the battery was dead. So, I bought a brand new one this time and it seemed fine at the first time. But after 20 hours of charging, I noticed it was barely charged or maybe not charged. The monitor said the camera is low in battery in 30 seconds. Now I’m done with this product and will return it within few days. I hope the manufacturer see this review and inspect their products before they sell this product to public.</span>
