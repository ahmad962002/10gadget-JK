                   <h4> What People Say:</h4>
<div class="slideshow-container">
<blockquote><em><div class="a-row a-spacing-small review-data"><span class="a-size-base review-text review-text-content" data-hook="review-body">
<span>[TL;DR Pros and Cons]<br/>Pros:<br/>***VERY Fast Response Time<br/>No Screen Tearing<br/>Okay Viewing Angles (For a TN Panel)<br/>Really Smooth Gameplay<br/>Amazing Customer Support<br/>Can technically run the Xbox Series X at 1080p 120FPS<br/><br/>Cons:<br/>Color Reproduction Inaccurate (As With All TN Panels)<br/>(Resolved Through BenQ Customer Service) Dead Pixels<br/>Console Set-Up (at least from my experience) has to be brute force to run 120FPS at 1080p.<br/><br/>[General Thoughts]<br/>This monitor is for the PC gamers who are serious about competitive gaming. This monitor and the XL2546K are the best in class monitors for almost instant response time at a 0.5ms average; you just have to think about what size is better. If you want everything in your vision I would go with the XL2546K, though if you're more like me and want a bigger screen that's a little more immersive the XL2746S is perfect. If tearing in games or motion blur is a problem for you this monitor or any of the Zowie monitors with DyAc+ should do the trick for any games and remedy these problems.<br/><br/>[Next Gen Consoles]<br/>The Xbox Series X does run at 120 FPS at 1080p on this monitor through it's HDMI 2.0 port though from my experience you have to brute force your way into the settings and activate it manually through the override menu. I'm not too sure on the PS5 though I can check soon and update this review.<br/><br/>[Problems and How They Were Resolved]<br/>So I just want to mention in my review that the monitor I originally got from Amazon later had a dead pixel problem down the line. Though the customer service at Zowie/BenQ was really good and they were able to trade in the monitor for a replacement. Later on the monitor they gave me in return had stuck pixels though the customer service was still kind enough to provide me with replacements until I got a good model.<br/>Hopefully this problem doesn't happen to any of you but if it does just be aware that for this specific product, new monitors come in the red boxes, the refurbished monitors come in normal cardboard brown.<br/><br/>[Color Reproduction and TN Panels]<br/>The color reproduction on TN Panels aren't that good and this monitor is a TN. Since the fastest refresh rates and response times are the easiest to achieve with a TN Panel this was the right choice overall. Though just be aware that doing any sort of color accurate work on this monitor isn't recommended.<br/><br/>[Conclusion]<br/>This is in my honest opinion one of the best 27-inch gaming monitors for competitors. Playing games like Valorant, Call of Duty, Quake give you a good bump up in FPS and response time from most TVs/monitors and even games like Super Smash Bros. Ultimate, Splatoon 2, Guilty Gear Xrd, Under Night In-Birth, and other 60FPS locked games feel really good also due to DyAc+ and the quick response time. Though if you want to have a single-monitor set-up that can both game and do freelance work that require accurate colors or a high resolution you might want to look elsewhere. This monitor works great for competitive gamers who need practice, competitive streamers who have secondary monitors to monitor their stream, or the ones who want to be very serious about their gaming equipment and have the space and money for secondary monitors for different works. I've personally had a dead pixel problem with this model though the customer service at BenQ/Zowie is so good with these kinds of problems that I didn't mind that much in the end.<br/><br/>All in All, if competitive gaming is a huge priority to you and you can fit this monitor in your budget. I would say go for this, or any of the other high end Zowie XL S or K Series monitors.</span>

<span>I instantly noticed the difference from 144-240hz in csgo and valorant; the only games I play. In terms of picture quality its hands down better than my 2411p and it's what you'd expect from a benq tn panel. The ergonomics are CRAZY I feel so locked in when I have it max height and tilted up. Overall worth it if you take fps' serious and are used to Benq. I've heard a lot of hype around the xg2431 but I've been a benq fanboy since the 2015 console days and didn't trust spending the same amount of money for a shot in the dark.</span>

<span>I've been using the display since April of 2020 so I've had plenty of time now to get used to it and give it a fair shake.<br/><br/>Brightness: If you enable DyAc+ and leave it on, the brightness can be adjusted as high as 400+ nits. However, if you turn off DyAc+, then it drops to roughly 320 nits.  I personally leave DyAc+ on all the time.<br/><br/>2D Picture Quality at 27": So a lot of people think they'll see pixelation at 1080p/27" and in my case I don't really notice it since I sit about 2 feet away from the monitor and i have it mounted on my wall. I previously had the 25" KD25F and found it too small for my liking so right now, this 27" hits the sweet spot. Remember, there is an 8 pixel per inch difference between 25" at 1080p vs 27" so all you have to do is move the 27" back a bit and you get the same view.<br/><br/>3D Gaming at 27": I got an FPS jump of &gt;30% going from 1440p back to 1080p with this display which was nice. As soon as I started playing CoD: Warzone I noticed the input lag and motion was far better than my old Asus PG278Q which is a 1 ms TN panel but from 2014. With DyAc+ enabled and the ultra low input lag of this display, my K/D shifted upwards and I've been averaging 5-15 kills per match in Warzone since I bought this monitor. With my old Asus PG279Q, I had peaked and could feel the input lag.<br/><br/>S Switch: Man what a handy little tool! I setup 2 profiles so far, one for desktop with the black equalizer set to 5 and vibrance set to 12 and DyAC turned off. When I want to game, I choose the other profile which turns DyAC to Premium while boosting vibrance and black equalizer. Very handy little tool that a lot of other manufacturers should think about copying.<br/><br/>Colors/Sharpness: Out of the box they're a bit dull so I just set it to user define + standard and gamma at 3 and now it looks pretty good. I also had to increase the Sharpness to 8/10. You should download the color profile for this display and then calibrate it. Since it is a true 8 bit display with near 100% sRGB, you will get very nice colors from it that matches a lot of IPS displays.<br/><br/>DyAc+: So this is the entire reason I bought this display, to have BFI that doesn't lose brightness when turned on. I can confirm that this monitor does not lose any brightness with DyAC enabled and infact gets MUCH BRIGHTER (up to ~480 nits peak) unlike every other competing display which tend to cut their brightness in half with BFI enabled. I briefly read about changing the vertical totals on these forums and since I likely won't hit 240 FPS even with a 9900k@5 Ghz and 2080 Ti in the games I play (Warzone/Apex Legends), I settled on 182 Hz with VT of 1350. I tested many different vertical total values out and 1350 just seemed to work best as the top/bottom of the screen had minimal blurring and the middle was great. It also works perfectly at 240 Hz with no VT adjustments needed.<br/><br/>Additionally, you can enter the service menu of this display and calibrate the area/intensity using the UFO Ghost page found on blurbusters or their utility. I did this for my display by setting a custom area/intensity in the service menu and have virtually NO ghosting (see attached image of UFOs).<br/><br/>Negatives:<br/>------------<br/>Yes there are unfortunately negatives with this display as there would be any display on the market.<br/><br/>TN: Because this is a TN display, it will have limited viewing angles and you should be prepared to sit in front of the monitor with at least 1.5-2 feet distance between you and it. I have my monitor mounted and sit back about 2 feet from it which is ideal.<br/><br/>Color: While the color is fantastic with it being a true 8 bit display, a lot of high end IPS have gone 10 bit and have better sRGB coverage than this one does so it doesn't match top tier IPS panels. If you want to do professional work, I would recommend having a separate IPS monitor for that or if you absolutely cannot afford two monitors, then buy an IPS monitor instead of this one.<br/><br/>Overdrive: This monitor does not have dynamic overdrive which is unfortunate. What this means is if you lower your refresh rate, AMA (what Zowie calls their overdrive) only has 3 settings and so you end up with more double images at refresh rates below 240 Hz  because the overdrive doesn't compensate. Some new displays (namely an AOC one) has dynamic overdrive which accounts for this and so you end up with no double images/ghosting while gaming at lower refresh rates. While not a deal breaker by any stretch, I would have loved to see Zowie include this.<br/><br/>Price: Let's face it, this is an expensive panel for 1080p and being TN. $650 is asking a lot but if you are a serious gamer that wants the best technology, you gotta pay. Other panels offer similar performance but they lack DyAc+ which is the ultimate differentiator. I'd say if you don't care about DyAc+, then you could get a panel from say Asus that costs $200 less and will give similar performance--just be aware that Asus displays BFI is &lt;200 nits which is pretty dark.<br/><br/>That's it, hope you found this review helpful. If I had to, I'd buy this monitor all over again and am highly satisfied with my purchase and you will be too.</span>

<span>Ever since my childhood, I have loved playing video games. As I grew older, I got more competitive in nature towards my gameplay. My favorite game franchise is Gears of War, and I dedicated a great deal of time to getting exceptionally good at it. However, I realized I needed lower input delays, and I would play against people who had a better advantage due to the fact they played on higher frames with lower response times. This led me to finally buying a BenQ Zowie monitor. After using this product for 2 months, I can confidently say that the BenQ Zowie XL2411K is a great monitor to invest in for a reasonable price.<br/>Primarily, the refresh rate of this monitor is 144hz; this was the greatest reason for me buying this monitor. This is what allowed me to be able to play on 120 frames per second (or frame rate) on the Xbox Series S. I should also note that this monitor was designed for the PlayStation 5 and the Xbox Series X as well and since they are the only consoles that can run 120 frames per second (FPS). The refresh rate along with the FPS are very closely related. Firstly, the frame rate is the number of images that a computer, video game console, or other device sends to the display every second. The refresh rate is how fast the display (or monitor) can show these frames. When you compare that to a regular TV that gives you about 30 frames per second with a refresh rate of 24 hertz, the difference between the monitor and a TV is as great as heaven and earth, respectively. As a result, you have a smoother display for your monitor, and this allows for better accuracy due to the clarity of your screen and seamless animations. Lastly, this monitor has an astounding 1 millisecond response time, in comparison to the latter, which has a response time between 2.3 and 8.1 milliseconds. The BenQ Zowie allows you to be able to react quickly, which is particularly helpful in fast paced shooters.<br/>This monitor has more nerdy picture settings. With gaming, it is typically difficult to sleep after a long session due to the exposure of blue lights your screen emits. Thankfully, there is a low blue light mode in the picture settings. The setting ranges from 1 to 10 for how much blue light you want to receive from your display. After using this mode, I have dealt with less eye strain, and I can play the game longer without pain. Another innovative feature is the DyAc technology that is featured in the picture setting. Dynamic Accuracy (DyAc) is technology exclusive to BenQ that negates eye tracking motion blur. According to BenQ, this does not cause any input delays. I personally have my DyAc setting on “premium” to take full advantage of this feature.<br/>The packaging for this monitor was very secure. It came in an attractive BenQ Zowie XL2411K red and black box. All the components were sealed in rubber and taped up. To ensure added safety, these components were encased in foam boxes.  The parts included the stand, the monitor screen, and the base. It even came in with a DisplayPort cable. The user manual gives you simple step- by-step instructions to set up the monitor. Since I ordered from Amazon, I got the monitor within 24 hours. Speaking of which, Amazon allows for free returns within 30 days (about 4 and a half weeks) of receiving the monitor in its original condition.<br/>To enhance your experience of this monitor (assuming you bought it), I do have some friendly advice. The most important advice I can give you is to keep your monitor on “Eco” mode. Now of course you can take this setting off to enhance your monitor’s performance, but if you want longevity for this device, I suggest you keep this setting on. Also, since this monitor supports 120 FPS at 1080p resolution for gaming, be sure you use the HDMI 2.0 cord (it is highly recommended you use the one that originally came with your console). Otherwise, you will only be able to play on 60 FPS. I am certain this also applies to PlayStation users as well, but on the Xbox Series S/X, you need to manually go to your “TV and Display” options and put your refresh rate on 120hz. One thing I will say is that there is a good chance you will not like the default colors for your picture. I personally had to tweak the colors to my liking. Lastly, for safety precautions, connect your monitor to a grounded extension cord. This is so in case of a power surge, the third prong directs the excess current toward the ground. Consequently, you and your devices are kept safe.<br/>If you are considering wanting to supplement your gameplay, this monitor is the way to go. When comparing the specifications of the BenQ Zowie XL2411K to a standard TV, the one on the former is practically playing in the future against the one on the latter. Specifically, the model I bought was 24 inches, so this monitor does not accommodate much space. These monitors are even used in eSport events. This piece of work is for competitive gamers who want a seamless gameplay experience that is comparable to gaming on a PC. There are more things on this monitor for me to learn about. Nonetheless, this monitor is worth the buy!</span>

<span>As the review headline says, "excellent deal."  A steal at $150 for a 27" monitor with a decent screen suitable for office work and gaming.  The extra size allows me more multitasking capability, which I need for work.  And it's always good to game on a bigger screen.  A good buy.  Recommended.  (Plus, the 2 HDMI ports are a bonus, since many monitors come with only one.)</span>

<span>I just got into the realm of building a PC and a friend recommended this to me as a starter monitor. I read a lot of reviews saying it came damaged, or that it was broken, or had a faulty base.<br/>My monitor came in great condition and was packaged properly. The base to the monitor is kind of wobbly so keep that in mind but as long as you're not slamming on your desk consistently you should be okay. Screen quality is great and I haven't seen any dead pixels so I feel it's a great starter monitor for gaming or anyone getting into the PC world</span>

<span>Our display is 100hz!!! We used the supplied display port cable and our options are 60hz, 75hz, or 100hz!<br/><br/>I turned the computer off and swapped the display port cable for the old HDMI cable that we were using because I wanted to see what options I would have now, being a different cable.<br/><br/>To my surprise we had the same options! 60, 75, and 100hz! We are now using our old HDMI cable that's still in good shape, so we can get sound from the trusty old gtx1650!<br/><br/>I don't know what kind of HDMI cable it is that I'm using other than it saying high speed. We also never see the 85 hz option, only 60, 75, and 100 for us.<br/><br/>The colors and contrast are noticeably brighter. We have had a few comments now from friends over "wow, that screen is nice and bright!" "Your new screen is so bright!" We are only using the standard settings that the monitor shipped with besides enabling adaptive sync.<br/><br/>The computer we have this display connected to is quite old and primarily used for gaming. We play Fortnite, Roblox, Left 4 Dead, horizon zero dawn, and assassin's Creed Odyssey on windows 11, AMD fx9590, 32g ram, Asus 990 fx motherboard, SSD and of course the gtx1650. All those games run and look magnificent on this display!! The first thing I noticed is how smooth the panning around and looking with the mouse was! You can see every detail in the motion blur, something I never noticed before. I thought it was cool.<br/><br/>The speakers are ok, not great. They do the job though if you need them to. One thing I like is they are able to be loud enough, which I can't say for most monitors speakers.<br/><br/>This display comes with some other options that I haven't even tried yet. I'm getting such good results already it's hard for me to distract myself from fun and instead go experiment more with the options. But they're gamer options for fps, rts, and few other settings that appeared to be greyed out from use, so I don't know what's up with that and never investigated.<br/><br/>But I'll give it five stars!</span>

<span>So I have a M1 MacBook Air. I tried the whole multi-monitor set up, but I couldn't get it to work. I decided to just go with a single ultra-wide, and browsing on amazon I saw this. For the the price I felt it would be a good monitor to try. So I have just hooked it up and have been using it for about 20-30 minutes or so. Here are my initial impressions. It was a simple plug and play. I didn't have to mess with resolution settings on the MacBook or anything. I was worried that maybe the screen would possibly be too small. But I would say it was just right for what I was going for. I like the display quality and as mentioned it is a nice size if you are pairing it with the MacBook Air (I have the 13 inch). I noticed that the screen comes with built it speakers so I gave them a try. They are pretty thin on the sound I would say. Cool in a pinch I suppose, but my MacBook sounds much better. Also, when I first hooked up the screen it gave me a weird vertigo feeling. I am not sure what that was about, but I dropped the hz down from 100 to 60. Not sure if that even made a difference or not, but I will say that it is not bothering me now as I am writing this. I also notice that there is a very faint line across the bottom of the screen but you have to look very hard to see it. Could just been my screen, and it could possibly go away. All in all for the price I would say that I am very happy with the purchase. For the price I would say that it is a good buy. I would recommend it. I have to say I am not going to use it for gaming or anything. Just perhaps working from home, so using the Microsoft apps; word, excel, outlook, and etc. Oh yeah, and also some lo-fi and web browsing in my down time.  Hopefully this helps others if they have any thoughts or concerns. P.S. I think the blue lights in the back are a nice touch. Perhaps in the future they can make those RGB and you can adjust them in the settings on the display.</span>

<span>I just received my Sceptre 32 inch monitor a few days ago and so far I'm loving it. I'm not an expert on this stuff but I'll give my thoughts.<br/><br/>It came safely packaged in the factory box (see pic) which was in an even larger Amazon box. The Amazon box was a bit too big actually, as you could feel the actual monitor box moving around, but I was happy to find nothing had been damaged.<br/><br/>Attaching the stand was easy, and came with the screws and screwdriver needed. *Read the manual first, as it states you should keep the monitor face down in the styrofoam when you attach the stand (which I did) to avoid any damage.*<br/><br/>I hooked it up and tested it with my PS4. My new laptop hasn't arrived yet so I can't speak to how it looks with connected to a PC, but it looks great on the console. One of the better 1080p displays I've seen. The menu buttons are easy enough and the picture is crisp. Movie mode is the best looking option but it also has FPS &amp; RTS modes for gaming, which reduces the sharpness but it's supposed to make enemies more visible in dark places and be more responsive. You can also customize these settings to your preference.<br/>The speakers, while not the best sounding I've heard, are actually pretty loud. I don't need to go much higher than 10-15. They do the job and you're probably not getting one of these for the sound quality anyway.  You can use the audio jack in the back for your headset.<br/><br/>I can actually notice better response time while playing some games online. The graphics on NBA 2K look much better than the old flat screen I was using lol and I really enjoy the way the curve gives that little extra feeling of immersion when you're sitting directly in front. I love the fact that this monitor can get up to 185 Hz. While my current console can only do 60FPS, the next gen consoles will reportedly get up to 120, so this monitor is future proof as far as that goes.<br/>Again, I haven't received my new laptop yet so I can't speak to the AMD FreeSync capabilities on this monitor or how the response time feels when PC gaming.<br/>(I did see a comment from the manufacturer that this is also G-Sync compatible so if that's true, it should be able to work with Nvidia cards as well)<br/><br/>One thing I don't like is the blue light filter only goes up to 30%. The feature itself is nice, and I use the one on my phone every day (it's set to come on at 11pm daily) but the fact you only have 3 percentages on this one is a little dissapointing. Nothing too serious though. Also, the FPS mode really sacrifices picture quality to get you the "better visibility and response time". It's unfortunate I'll probably never use it because the picture looks so washed out and distracting when it's engaged.<br/><br/>Overall, I'm happy with my purchase and have not noticed any backlight bleeding or screen tearing on my games or any problems at all. I wanted a monitor bigger than a 24 without sacrificing too much picture quality but also not breaking the bank. This was it.<br/>For the price, it's a great buy. I had a couple Amazon gift cards saved, so this basically only cost me the $49 plus tax. I'll take that every day of the week.</span>

<span>I purchased one of these monitors about 7-8 months ago, really enjoyed the sleekness of the design and overall quality. Graphics were good, I typically play Crusader Kings 3 and Warzone on it. As for the reason I gave it a four star instead of a five star is the stand. I have a computer desk where the monitor is elevated on a different platform. Typically with a bit wider bases I never had issue, however the other day I had an issue where the monitor fell over rather easily causing the screen to break immediately. As mentioned in the past with a bit wider bases I never had an issue with tipping over.<br/><br/>Still a good quality monitor, I just would suggest not having an elevated platform when using this monitor.</span>

<span>I never liked the idea of a curved display; I just thought it was a gimmick that doesn't really do anything differently than a standard display did, and well, I still think that, BUT, this monitor is very nice regardless of whether it's using a gimmick or not. The colors out of the box weren't to my liking, but after toying around with the settings, I found the perfect combination that looks good to me.<br/><br/>Putting the stand on was a breeze and completely fool proof... Even came with a little screwdriver! Very convenient. The stand kind of "snaps" on to a particular spot, so there's no worry about getting it on crooked or anything, so that's a plus too.<br/><br/>When it comes to this "free sync" stuff, I admit, I don't know what any of it means. I don't even know if I'm using it right now! I have it turned on in the settings menu sure, but I don't really notice any differences between when it's on and when it's off, so I guess I can't comment too much about any of this.<br/><br/>There's two things incredibly bad about this display which prevents it from getting the full five stars: The audio quality and the power supply.<br/><br/>I use very nice external speakers for my PC setup, so I never really heard the audio quality from this monitor until I was playing an Xbox One game. I was right in the middle of a scene where two people were talking on the phone. You know how in movies and stuff, they always make the other person on the line sound a little garbled and low quality to simulate their voice actually coming through the phone? That was what was happening for BOTH people in the scene, and I thought it was just odd directing, but no! The next scene where people were talking in the same room had the same bad, garbled quality and that's when it occurred to me: The speaker quality on this display is terrible! Luckily though, I was able to pull out a standard audio cable to hook my PC speakers to the monitor, so now I can use those speakers for both my PC and my Xbox games. Thank God for that.<br/><br/>The other issue is the power supply, and it's simply because it's packed with a big box power cable. I hate these things, and I've hated them since back in the day! I really can't fathom why these boxes still exist. Has nobody realized that take up too much space? Even though it only needs one port, it's currently taking up two on my surge protector because if I have it on the very end port, it's loose and can fall out of place at any moment! It's a complete waste of space and I'm losing a port on my surge protector because of it. Even if the supply still needed to use a box, it could still have ended in a normal power cord. I've seen that design many times over the years, but not on this. Very frustrating.<br/><br/>All in all, despite the two flaws I mentioned, this is a great display! Just make sure you get some nice speakers if you already don't have some. You'll enjoy the monitor much more if everything didn't sound like it was coming from a broken eighties payphone.</span>

<span>One drawback is when it comes to PC's and Monitors, you won't know for sure until you try it out for yourself. You can ask the seller questions, but sometimes the question you should have asked isn't obvious until the thing is sitting on your desk. It may boil down to something very specific to your application/environment/ergonomics that the seller, or even the manufacturer can't give you a definitive answer because of the subjective nature of sitting in front of a screen for hours at a time.<br/>  A big help for me in determining which to order is to download the user manual and quick set-up guides from the Manufacturer Website. By carefully reading the specs and going through the OSD Menu entries I am sure that what I'm ordering, at least on paper, has the right specs. This way, the monitors should have all the right comparable specs and you should end up with what you really want. Still, as was it was in my case you may have to try it out before you can finalize the purchase.<br/>  I need a widescreen curved monitor such as this 30" Scepter with PBP (split screen) so as to be able to work on documents from two different inputs, i.e. two PC's. So I am reviewing this from more of a business angle, not from a Gaming criteria.<br/>  Basically, it is a simple, single-purpose gaming PC Monitor. If used just for gaming on an Nvidia Graphics PC, it works as advertised. You've got to match video cards, max res, number and type of inputs, hdmi 1.4, 2.0? Is Displayport 1.2 enough?  I finally narrowed down to a 30-32 inch 21:9 ultrawide, curved, (gaming) monitor though I would only use it for business. I need a split screen with quick and easy transition from one input to another. To change inputs from one PC to another on this monitor requires 11 button pushes and the dual split-screens are squished horizontally as determined by the screen width and 2560hz horizontal resolution. Nothing really wrong with the monitor itself. My opinion is that this monitor should be best acknowledged as a single input Gaming monitor. It was not quite suitable for my application. Better would be a wider monitor with higher horizontal frequency.<br/>  The Wall Plate though not it's intended use can be  attaching it to a standard 4 hole Vesa mounting arm plate. It comes with a 75mm 4 hole Adapter, so it can be done. Two little bolts attach one side to the monitor, the other side can be fastened to a regular Monitor mounting plate (75mm hole pattern) on the extended arm of your vesa desktop stand mounted to your desk .  You will have to obtain an additional four M4 x 20mm bolts, with washers and nuts to bolt (fasten) Wall Mount to the Vesa plate of your stand. Easily accomplished except for  obtaining your own hardware. No wall plate screws are supplied as there are different types of wall mounts.<br/>  At this price point, as I've mentioned, this monitor is designed to work best with a PC having an Nvidia Video Card using GSync. They tell you up front how it's designed to work. With the right hardware you can get the 160 - 200 hz frequency for high-end gaming. With Displayport 1.2  I was able to get 120hz picture that was good enough for ordinary Windows 10 desktop, but I can't comment how it would work for gaming. Need Displayport 1.4, or Hdmi 2.0 to obtain 160-200hz. The Nvidia drivers must be up to date and can be downloaded from Nvidia Website. The driver page lists a long paragraph of Nvidia cards compatible with that driver. It may work well enough with other PC video cards as well, but I was using an old GT 620. No problem with the latest driver but not suitable for intensive gaming.<br/>  Using with a Mac, (I have a Macbook Pro) is a crapshoot. Older Macs are designed to work with older Mac compatible hardware. This monitor, as is the case with the majority of OEM generic monitors, is directed at the Windows PC Market. If it works with your Mac, well and good, but don't count on it, not for serious gaming for sure. My 2011 Macbook Pro has early thunderbolt - backwards compatible with mini-displayport. I used a mini-displayport cable with short mini-displayport to Displayport adapter. Macbook has a 2560x1440 spec video output. It connected with the monitor but full-screen picture was a little vertically flattened, (i.e.horizontall stretched); not acceptable. Mac System Preferences Display Icon showed 1080p. That is correct, but the Macbook is designed for 4:3 ratio. My Macbook was never intended to handle 21:9 aspect ratio; not the fault of the monitor. Works perfect though with my 21.5 inch Acer screen. Newer macs with thunderbolt 3, a.k.a. USB-C should be compatible with USB-C input monitors.<br/>  In order to avoid the hassle of a return, my advice is to ask the seller - better yet, download the manual, especially with third-party sellers as return shipping is pretty expensive. Be aware of the intended use and specs and consider that in order to get a monitor with better options, you might have to spend another $100.00 or more.  What I could determine is that used as intended and properly set up, it will do what is advertised at 160hz For business, with dual inputs, maybe not, but the manufacturer does not advertise it as anything but designed for gaming so I really can't complain. I had to try it to find out.<br/><br/>Walter O.</span>

<span>I bought this monitor for work 2 months ago as I became tired of looking at my small laptop screen. The size of this is perfect for having two programs up at the side by side without having an extra monitor. I am not gaming on this monitor, so I have yet to test the gaming experience. The colors however are a little bit off and you definitely see some ghosting effects when moving your mouse or dragging programs around. With the stand that comes with it, you cannot adjust the height of the monitor, just the tilt. I paired it with a mounting arm to help with that. For work, I have no major complaints as it serves its purpose.</span>

<span>What this is not is a hard-core gaming monitor.<br/><br/>What this monitor will allow you to do is bridge the gap between a low quality home pc monitor and a better spec'd monitor. This monitor will give you a great picture and decent refresh rate for something in this price that will serve your average everyday gamer and PC user.  Now if your looking for a cheap gaming monitor that will help you get ranked in CoD,Apex or OverWatch, this ain't it look else where.

<span>I have bought sceptre monitors in the past, and I stand by them as a great budget monitor company if you want something that's reliable and inexpensive. I purchased these monitors as secondary monitors and vertical monitors for my setup. From my experience, I knew that these monitors would be good for work other than gaming, so I primarily use them for watching videos, discord, or just as an extra screen for when I am doing work. I overall enjoy these monitors, but I have two major issues that I had first when I got them.<br/><br/>I love the monitors, and they could be a 5-star product if they tweaked a couple of things. I will talk first about the main advantages of the monitors first. Firstly, for $150, you are getting a monitor with decent viewing angles and a good size with 75hz refresh rate viewing. For the price, it is a very good monitor alone for office or schoolwork. It does its job very well and anybody who is doing basic work or maybe some console gaming would have a good experience with these monitors. Furthermore, they are VESA mount* (more on that below), and it has a good display, with a speaker that although quiet, does the job well without sounding blown out. Overall, it is a good monitor, and anybody who wants something basic will enjoy this monitor.<br/><br/>Here are the cons from my experience, as it had a couple off the start. I first opened the box to find that it talks about its return policy on the box. This was extremely concerning since it is almost impossible to send this monitor back. Please keep everything (including box and packaging materials) for the first month you own the monitor. The second issue I had was the mounting brackets you get with the monitor. For one thing, the monitor uses a separate monitor arm, that is screwed into a bracket that comes out of the monitor. If you plan on not using any desk mounts or VESA mounting, then you will have no problem with this monitor. However, I wanted to mount this monitor to a VESA desk mount to use as a vertical monitor. My first issue came when I tried to mount the monitor, when I tried to mount the monitor to the arm by screwing in the screws provided with the arm. The first issue comes with the hardware included with the monitor, there are four standoffs and two monitor screws, but the arm needed four screws, so we already are set back. I found some old monitor screws that fit, and when I mounted the monitor, I realized that the monitor wouldn't fit due to the bracket secured on the back, which sticks out of the monitor to make more viewing angles. Again, this won't be an issue for those who are planning on not using any VESA mounting, however, it makes the process a lot more difficult for those who are planning on doing any mounting of their monitor with a third party device. It took me like 20 minutes before I realized that the standoffs that are included are for VESA mounting, which although makes some sense, also makes me question why to include the mounting bracket externally when it could have been included inside of the monitor since there is a cutout section that fits it.<br/><br/>I see this question a lot, and I feel that I should address it here for those who want to game on this monitor: get a different monitor. First, this monitor is a 75hz 5ms, meaning it refreshes the screen 75 times in one second, and it responds 5ms after the information has been sent by the PC. There are plenty of 144hz monitors with a 1ms response time for this price, and I recommend that you look for something at that price. If you want something to game on for the long run, get a 144hz monitor at the same price, it'll work better overall, and be around the same budget.<br/><br/>Overall I highly enjoy this monitor. I give it four stars since it works very well for what I need it to do, and although it has its flaws I wouldn't want another monitor. It could have been five stars, only if the price was a little bit cheaper. The price does go up with the blue light shift that occurs, but the $133 option is still a little overpriced, I would personally price this around $115 and it would be the ultimate monitor for the price. Overall, if you want a monitor for office work, then please consider this, it's a great monitor.</span>

<span>First of all, excuse my English. Gonna be honest, the picture quality looks ugly out of the box and too bright but if you sit down and patiently adjust the colors and few other characteristics on the menu, you can get a really good image quality and you can make your games look pretty and run very well.<br/><br/>The sound is not that bad as other reviews says but I use headphones anyway so it doesn't affect me.<br/><br/>If you don't have too much money to spend and are looking for a budget gaming monitor, this one will do the job until you can get something better. It can be used as a second monitor too if you are into streaming. To see the chat, your streaming software, etc.<br/><br/>This monitor does the job. You just have to sit down and make some adjustments.<br/><br/>Oh! And Make Sure to increase it to 75hrtz!!! Is set to 60hrtz. Go to the menu and increase it. It makes a big difference!</span>

<span>It's been a few day from a year ago when I bought this monitor. This is such an amazing monitor for what specs it offers, the colors it out puts, and the image quality you get. If you play FPS games that needs that extra responsiveness to help you get that win then look no more. This is your next Gaming monitor. I will say out out the box colors are little saturated; however there's profiles online you can force this monitor to be color accurate. The finally thing I want to say is run this monitor in AMA 2 mode because its the best mode for responsiveness at any FPS. No buyers remorse here!</span>

<span>This monitor is a fantastic value if you want a 1080p gaming monitor. It is fast- 165Hz without overclocking, and has some of the best monitor speakers I've ever used. They're not Apple Studio Display speakers, but this monitor costs about 6 times less. They are fine for casual listening and even gaming when you don't want to wear a headset or keep your desk setup clean, which is what I do.<br/><br/>The HDR implementation is not that great to me- the sRGB and FPS modes are the ones I like the most. This monitor has an amazing stand- height adjustable and it pivots from side to side as well. It is heavy and solid. For gaming, this monitor is great. Colors pop, it has Gsync and Freesync, and I have been enjoying it immensely. My unit has some minor IPS glow in a corner, but blacks are generally deep and even- no IPS bleed!<br/><br/>For the price, this monitor offers a lot of value. I can't recommend it enough for PC gaming- give it a try! You won't be disappointed.</span>

<span>The monitor is great no doubt, although if you just bought a pc and need a monitor to start off with this is great. Some things I dislike about it though were the speakers aren’t the best but they do the job for example I can watch movies and YouTube on it no problem but if you want to listen to music somewhat loud with bass the monitor just won’t keep up with that. No hate though everything else like the quality I was really impressed with. The led’s are nice as well.</span>

<span>The screen is bright and the picture is clear.  I bought it for technical work and not gaming.  I'm going to keep it regardless of the fact that if a person scrools down the display to where this product is compared to others screens, it says that it's a LED display.  It's not.  It is a LCD display.  It meets my needs so I'll keep it but I did want a LED display.  I tried to report this situation to Amazon but the link to report an issue of this type is not functional.</span>

<span>Great monitor. I like the thin bezels, though if you ignore the bottom part. The coloring is great, you can of course change the contrast and the colors. Easy to setup, though the monitor stand that comes with it is a weird three stand thing, a lot different from a circle kind of stand. It works great though, very stable.</span>

<span>The monitor looks absolutely phenomenal and delivers a great frames per second value to those who are looking for something higher than a TV. The only downside to it is for those who want an all in one package, there are sadly no speakers. This is made up for easily in the ease of use and settings of the monitor, as you can simply use headphones or a stand-alone speaker to make up for the lack of one.</span>

<span>Bought the monitor, and about 8 months into using with no issues, some weird lines started appearing on the screen.  Monitor was still playable, but a nuisance in certain game situations.  I filed the RMA, sent the monitor to them to getting notification that they were not covering the warranty due to neglect because the top frame was broken causing the screen to be completely busted.  I worked with the warranty department in filing a claim with FedEx and received an email two days later that the monitor was repaired, tested and awaiting shipment.  I received the monitor back today and it was not repaired and had a paper behind the packing slip that I requested to not have the monitor fixed at this time.<br/><br/>Now on to the monitor, I really enjoyed the monitor and everything that it had to offer.  It was crystal clear, and gave me a completely new outlook on gaming.  I will say that this monitor out of all the monitors I have owned, this one is the top pick for me.  It's sleek, fits into my build perfectly, and overall very satisfied with the monitor, just not the support.</span>

<span>I used to rock an old 60hz LG monitor and decided it was time to upgrade to at least 144hz. The blur was killing me at 60hz. So I purchased this 165hz VG248QG monitor for about 200 dollars. I had no idea what I was in for, so I definitely crossed my fingers.<br/>I've now had this monitor for 1 week and I'm happy to report that I am very happy with it!<br/>Though everything is working well so far, there are some things to take note of.<br/><br/>I use a GTX1080 TI GPU and Ryzen 3600 CPU with 16gb 3200mhz (on a B450-F Gaming motherboard).<br/>At boot, the first thing I noticed, was the factory default color setting was very bright and washed out.<br/><br/>The monitor's panel menu does have presets which I felt were all "meh". Either too blurry or too sharp or too much contrast, etc etc. So I used the "User" mode instead, to which I spent about 10-15 minutes fiddling with my color settings.  I was a bit disappointed however, because despite getting the colors to my liking, I couldn't get the blacks to go deeper.  I messed with the Nvidia control panel settings too and I finally got it to how I like it. However, upon booting up my pc the next day, the colors were washed out again. Couldn't figure it out.<br/>I updated my drivers after DDU'ing (display driver uninstaller), etc etc.<br/><br/>I finally figured it out. On cold boot, this TN panel monitor actually takes about 5 for the blacks to deepen on it's own. Not sure if this is just the way TN panels work.  Everything looked very nice right after. (a warm up time?)<br/>The colors definitely look much better and more accurate than my old 60hz monitor, but I'm not going to say it's the best out there, since I don't have anything else to compare it to. But considering I am also a seasoned graphic designer, I do pick up on color details and this monitor does just fine after you mess with your settings and allow for the brightness and contrast to fully set after a cold boot.<br/><br/>You can also save multiple user settings, if you want specific color settings per game or any other media, which is great.<br/><br/>I did immediately set my monitor refresh rate to 165hz manually (remember to do this as it will be at a system default of 60hz) and man.... it is buttery smooth! I could not wait to try Apex on it. The game was night and day. I can now track and beam enemies down so much easier now as they don't blur out at 60hz anymore.  :D<br/>Everything just looks better now. More fluidity and less eye straining. However, I will say, it took some time for me to get used to the smoothness. I had a slight headache at first (much like when you get a new pair of glasses).<br/><br/>Some important things to know here...  I have a bunch of games I wanted to test out and I was sad to learn that there were games I couldn't get to look smooth because the games themselves were designed with a 60fps cap. Basically what this means is, your game may look a bit stuttery/motion blurry ( in some cases, worst than they did on a 60hz monitor).<br/>There are tweaks out there you can try to get some of these games to run smoother.<br/><br/>You won't run into these issues with newer games though, as they're all being designed to perform at higher frame rates. Some old games like Alien vs Predator (2010) do work beautifully though. It's a hit or miss.<br/><br/>I plan to update my review over time, especially if things go wrong.  Hopefully not, but time will tell.  For the moment, I really like it. It was affordable and performs leaps better than my old 60hz panel.  Apex Legends looks great at 165hz and so does Doom Eternal, Monster Hunter World, Bioshock 2 and Mass Effect Andromeda. :)<br/><br/>BTW, I purchased a display port cable so I could get the 165hz to work (it wont work with standard hdmi apparently), but when I opened the box, I saw that it already came with a display port cable. So now I have 2. Oh well, no biggie. Doesn't hurt to have a back up. :)<br/><br/>BUY IT!!!</span>
