<span>The buds from Apple did not work with my iPhone 13. So, I bought a these NRG. First of all, it worked fine with my iPhone. Make calls, learn French, listen to music. I grew up when large floor speakers in wood cabinets were the start for a high quality audio system. These things mimic that. Warm tones that still handle every sound, every note, discreetly. I am hearing things I never heard before. Nice.</span>

<blockquote><em><div class="a-row a-spacing-small review-data"><span class="a-size-base review-text review-text-content" data-hook="review-body">
<span>these earbuds are truly the best i’ve ever tried. if anything happens to them (losing them, putting them through the washer on accident, wires get disconnected due to me pulling on them too much) i immediately buy another pair. i prefer the sound quality and bass in these earbuds much more compared to something like apple airpods. the only thing i don’t like is if you keep the music too loud, the speakers start sounding staticky. this is a problem with all headphones/earbuds i’ve had. overall, these earbuds are absolutely amazing.</span>

<span>I ordered these and then found my Apple earbuds so I figured I would return these once they came. However, I tried them and they are amazing. Sound and noise canceling is better then any wired or wireless earbuds I’ve tried.</span>

<span>I made sure to get from Amazon warehouse and have gotten 3. All three were new and work well. The one problem with these is that you have to watch that the line doesn’t get crushed where it meets the lightenings connector because it can break the connection. But for the price worth it. I hate worrying about recharging. I reenforce that part of the line with tape now</span>

<span>Unfortunately, Apple has redesigned their earbuds so that they are now even smaller than they used to be.  Already, with the old design, they were so small I had to cover each ear bud with a specially made silicone thingie (which are called “Lunies Apple Earpods Covers”), so that they’d stay in my ears.  Now with this new Apple design, the earpieces are so small that they fall out even with the silicone thingie on.  I’m knocking off 2 stars, because now they’re twice as annoying.<br/><br/>As usual, Apple’s packaging is amazing.  This might be a weird thing to notice or care about, but aesthetically it’s a pleasure to see such beautiful design.  If only they would take as much care in the product itself!  To me, the fact that they fall out is really a downer, because I use earbuds not just for phone calls but to listen to music while commuting.  The first day I used them, even with the silicone covers on, they fell out every few minutes.  I actually had to Jerry rig a second pair of silicone covers in order to get the damn buds to stay in.  (I use two covers per bud, now, but have to carefully trim the second cover so that it fits over the first.)  Obviously, it would be more desirable if I didn’t have to use any silicone covers in the first place.  But two?!  Do better, Apple, and I don’t mean by skimping on materials.</span>

<span>If you've been wondering how such a highly-rated product like this can also have one-star reviews stating these earbuds have "absolutely no bass whatsoever" and sound "horribly tinny", I'd like to offer an explanation.<br/><br/>These Panasonics are not designed to be placed in the ears and worn like classic earbuds.  If that's how you wear them, you'll get nothing but tinny sound at relatively low volume (think 1960's pocket transistor radio.) These earbuds are specifically designed to fit snugly into the ear, forming an airtight seal.  If you choose too small of an earpad and/or don't push them in far enough, you won't hear any low-end frequencies. It's only when you get an airtight seal that the earbuds will instantly come alive with full-range sound and volume.<br/><br/>Here's a quick analogy: Tightly plug both ears with your fingers, close your mouth, and hum the lowest note you can.  Now take your fingers away, and notice how almost all of the low end and volume drops out.  That's the difference between a proper fit and an improper fit with these earbuds.  Although the acoustic principles are different, these earbuds must literally plug your ears in order to give you the full frequency spectrum.  Otherwise they'll sound horrendous.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, Panasonic wasn't very forthcoming on their product's packaging about how to wear the earbuds, and I'm certain some unwitting consumers are throwing away perfectly good pairs.<br/><br/>As an audio engineer, I can assure you these earbuds, when properly fitted, sound excellent for the price.  They're not audiophile-quality earbuds with the sonic transparency of a $200 pair of studio-reference headphones, and they're not as ergonomic as a $150 pair of Westones, but for the price, they are an exceptionally fantastic bargain.  Do they have a lot of bass?  They're not deficient in any of the low frequencies, but they're not bass-enhanced earbuds, either, which some of you may be used to.  They have a relatively nice, flat bass response as is, but if you want extra bottom end on your music, you'll want to boost the low end of your MP3 player's EQ.  Fortunately, boosted lows, even the deepest of lows, are handled very well by these Panasonics.<br/><br/>As a result of how these earbuds are designed to be worn, they could be uncomfortable for some people to wear for extended periods of time.  The earpads are very soft and pliable, though, and I personally don't experience any discomfort wearing them.  Since these earbuds are designed to be wedged into your ear, there are two unique, negative issues to point out:<br/><br/>1. Be very careful not to drop your MP3 player, because having earbuds ripped out of your ear canal is not a pleasant experience.<br/><br/>2. These earbuds may amplify the sound of your heartbeat when it's racing during an intense workout.  The incessant "tick tick tick" is loud enough that it becomes extremely annoying during quiet passages in the music you're listening to.<br/><br/>In summary, the audio quality of these earbuds, when properly fitted, will satisfy 99.9% of the general population.  I would not recommend them for bike riding or street running since they block out ambient noise, and if you're an audio engineer, you may find them a touch brittle on the high end, but if you need some quality earbuds to tune out the world for a while, these Panasonics are an excellent choice and a phenomenal value.</span>

<span>UPDATE July 2 2017:<br/>At some point, I ended up using these as my primary headphones. After adjusting to them, they are actually very comfortable. The first several times I wore them (see my original review, below) they weren't that comfortable but I evidently didn't give them enough of a chance.<br/><br/>1. They are very comfortable to wear even over long periods of time. I use them as my headphones for all day at work and they don't bother my ears.<br/>2. They stay in just fine working, walking, etc. I haven't tried them while jogging but I've yet to have much issue with them falling out or coming too loose.<br/>3. The sound is great for the price. It's not "Bose" or anything obviously, but the sound is much better than my Coby earbuds and roughly equivalent to my SoundBot. In short, it's balanced and clear without sounding super bass-y nor tinny.<br/>4. I've just learned today that they are very durable! I was looking all over for them and couldn't find them so I just used some other headphones and what do you know - I had tucked them in a shirt pocket and accidentally washed (and dried) them! I thought for sure they were done for. The cable even felt a little bit softer, but nope! I plugged them into my laptop and started up a video and they still worked. They didn't sound any different than before I washed(!) them. They were very tangled but I can live with that.<br/><br/>Overall, I would highly recommend these headphones now after giving them more of a chance myself. And, if you're like I was initially, try giving your ears a little more time to adjust.<br/><br/>ORIGINAL REVIEW (November 2015):<br/>I read several reviews before buying these and got intrigued. My ears are small or shaped weird - especially my left one. I don't know what it is but I have never found ear buds comfortable. The original kind that have a Hershey Kiss speaker shape that goes in your ear - those are the worst. The soft in-ear kind are significantly better, but still not comfortable to me and they have a tendency to fall out. I prefer regular over the ear headphones but those aren't so acceptable at work.<br/><br/>I bought a pair of SoundBot headphones that were super comfy, but after awhile the left side broke. It still works, but jiggling the wire pauses songs, skips songs, and even turns the volume up or down (which there isn't actually a control on the headphones for). Wanting to find a replacement (and not be locked in to one specific brand of style), I tried these.<br/><br/>For starters, they are cute. I mean, for ear buds. The blue is a pretty blue, it is a bit brighter than say, royal/Superman blue.<br/><br/>Also, they do actually stay in my ears pretty well. The ear piece sort of hooks into the shape of your ear in a similar manner as the SoundBot ones, locking it in place. It isn't stuck in there however, and still relies a bit on the shove-it-in-your-ear factor.<br/><br/>The cord is decently long, a comfortable length in my opinion. However, it is thin. I feel like it could easily have a similar problem within a few months if I don't take extra good care of them. That said, there is no control for anything on these headphones so hopefully if it started getting damaged, it would have no effect.<br/><br/>The sound is very good, especially for the price. I have a pair of cheap, Coby ear buds and the sound quality on those is noticeably lower than any others I have tried - so these are better than that, at least. These I would say are a notch below my SoundBot headphones and a few notches above the Coby. I would say my SoundBot headphones are about on par with my original Galaxy S5 headphones for sound quality,  if that helps.<br/><br/>One thing I dislike is that I can easily hear background noise through these headphones. It isn't crystal clear, but in a noisy office, I find myself having to turn the volume up further. It isn't to say that they are SUPPOSED to have noise-cancel, but I got used to it with my Galaxy S5 headphones and especially with my SoundBot ones. Galaxy S5 headphones block out the majority of background noise, and the SoundBot ones block out all but the loudest. Even without anything playing, they have a noise-cancel effect.<br/><br/>OK, now for my primary complaint. All other factors the same, I would be very satisfied with these headphones if they were only more comfortable. It's strange, too, because on the right ear it's perfect. On the left ear, painful. I have avoided using my Galaxy S5 headphones because they aren't so comfortable to me, but I actually practically retired these ones in favor of those. I don't know what it is about my left ear. I tried switching the medium/default tip for the smallest and I might say that's even less comfortable? I can't quite put my finger on it. The speaker hole is narrower - it's an oval, not a circle, giving almost an appearance like the latest iPhone headphones. I thought that would have been perfect, and it is on my right ear. My right ear could probably wear it all day, but my left ear can't stand it.<br/><br/>So, I know I have talked most this review about my broken SoundBot headphones, but that's only because they are the most comfortable ear buds I have ever found. For me, comfort takes precedence over pretty much all other features (save for price) because I just can't stand wearing most ear buds. That said, here is the fib ranking:<br/><br/>Sound Quality:<br/>1st/2nd: Galaxy S5 and SoundBot (tie)<br/>3rd: These Panasonic headphones<br/>4th: Coby<br/><br/>Comfort:<br/>1st: SoundBot<br/>2nd: Galaxy S5<br/>3rd: These Panasonic headphones<br/>4th: Coby<br/><br/>Appearance:<br/>1st: These Panasonic headphones<br/>2nd: Galaxy S5<br/>3rd: Coby<br/>4th: SoundBot<br/><br/>Price:<br/>1st: These Panasonic headphones<br/>2nd: SoundBot (by a few dollars)<br/>(I can't rank the Galaxy S5 because they can with my phone and the Coby came as part of a set with other headphones)<br/><br/>Features/Functionality:<br/>1st: Galaxy S5 (play/pause/skip/phone and volume)<br/>2nd: SoundBot (play/pause/skip/phone)<br/>3rd/4th: These Panasonic headphones and Coby (tie - no controls)<br/><br/>Overall, if my left ear wasn't so sensitive I would probably love these. Because it is so sensitive, I find them almost unusable. Otherwise, for the price and general quality, I would recommend them for less finicky ears.</span>

<span>Of course what sounds good is very subjective, so just because I am very pleased with these does not mean you will be....<br/><br/>In the past I have been pleasently surprised by the sound quality of Panasonic headphones.  I was therefore hoping these would be much better than the price would suggest.<br/><br/>These earbuds did not let me down.  They sound great.  The highs and mids are clear and the bass sounds natural; that is, the bass is not weak or overpowering, and is not muddy or thumpy.<br/><br/>Better still, they fit in my ears!! They are comfortable, secure (don't feel like they are going to slip out), and do a very good job of blocking (not cancelling) ambient sounds and noise.  This is a pleasent added surprise for me as most earbuds I have tried did not fit securely nor comfortably.<br/><br/>I do not care for earbuds.  I much prefer closed ear headphones but there are times when I must use earbuds instead.  I would never spend a lot for earbuds but I want value for what I do pay.<br/><br/>These Panasonic earbuds deliver a lot of value for the price.

<span>In just the past several years the difference between the least expensive IEM headphones (in-ear-monitor, or "earbud") and the "high-end," premium-priced models (some costing as much as $1000.00 and requiring special fitting by an audiologist) has been reduced to a degree sufficient to "fool" the most discerning listeners in a blind-fold test.  Of course, any failure to differentiate the "cheap" from the ultra-high end brand would immediately be blamed on numerous variables, which are likely to affect a listener's judgments about an "earbud"-sized phone more than is the case with full-sized headphones.  With IEM phones there are always questions about the size and materials of the ear-tips, and the particular "seal" that is achieved while listening.  Moreover, the judgment is always necessarily highly "subjective" and relative to listeners' personal tastes.  If it's not a blindfold test, the preference may come down to listeners' susceptibility to makers' promotional material, the added "designer-quality" features (including packaging), and lots of elitist hype supported by technological jargon based on physics and acoustic principles.<br/><br/>Oddly, listeners tend to disregard the source material and its limitations, regardless of the technology of the transducers (i.e. phones or speakers) used to reproduce the frequencies of the source material.  Yet, more often than not, the source material is compressed to the size of an mp3 file with a bit rate of 128 kbps as compared to a non-compressed WAV or AIFF file of 1411 kbps.  So unlike the high fidelity systems of the 1970s--AR3 vs. KLH "sealed" speakers vs. McIntosh and JBL combinations of woofers, mid-range drivers, and tweeters in a single gigantic cabinet--all designed to transmit the "non-compressed" signal embedded in the grooves of a long-playing record--the "stakes" in today's audio comparison/shoot-outs are far lower and less significant.  Instead of "which system can reproduce the full frequency spectrum?", the question has been reduced, merely, to which system sounds best while translating the limited information of an MP3 file into sound that is most pleasing to the perception of the listener?<br/><br/>With practice and with certain types of music that has been recorded by certain engineers, I'm now able to distinguish between Apple Lossless compression (files of 768 kbps) and common MP3 files (128 Kbps), but the perceived difference is neither habit-forming nor behavior- changing.  I'm still inclined to go with whatever "sounds best" to my ears.  Invariably, I'm impressed by the phones or speakers that, to my sensibilities, best represent the "sounds in nature," ie., the actual, pure and non-distorted, non-altered sounds of instruments recorded individually and in ensemble contexts as well as the complete range of the male and female human singing voice.  But when listening to an engineer like Rudy Van Gelder, who distorts the sound of the piano and enhances the sound of horns to offer the listener clearest access to all of the instruments being recorded, the headphones or speakers can do little to rectify the imbalances found in the source material.  It's when listening to the engineers who recorded "Kind of Blue" at Columbia Records or to the recordings of Roy Dunann for Contemporary Records that my ears perceive the truest, most "natural," deepest and most complex sound of an instrument, or instruments, or the human voice--IN SPACE.  Without regard to "context" (or what some listeners refer to as "ambiance") there is no longer a standard of reference, or a "sound in nature," which necessarily will have 3-dimensional realism, or depth.  Instead, the sound is manufactured and altered long before being picked up by various amplifying speakers in earphones, headphones, or elaborate speaker systems.<br/><br/>In the case of these Panasonic phones (costing $5) and the Sony phones (costing $10--though there are times when the prices are reversed, depending upon matters such as color and supply-demand), the consumer can be prepared to hear full-fidelity music, with clear reproduction of textures and pitches, from the double bass through the piano (and its overtones) through a percussion kit (including bass drum, snares, crash and ride cymbals, and the hi-hat's "chic chic" sound on the off-beats), to the human voice itself (in this instance, Roberta Gambarini's).<br/><br/>I compared the two phones with each other as well as with phones in the $50-$100 area (Sony MDR-EX300LP, Altec Titanium Backbeat UHP326) and phones in the $200 area (Sony MDR-EX700LP).  I suspect that the latter phones not only "wear longer" (due to better construction, thicker cords, etc.) but "wear better" (I can listen to music for several hours without any sense of discomfort or mounting pressure in the ear).  But as far as initial impressions go, the sonic differences are too small (and subjective) to be worthy of mention. The Sony phones are very slightly smaller and more lightweight, which may account for my sense that the music I was hearing from the Panasonics had fuller textures and more body, especially in the mid-range.  To put it differently: with the Sony phones I was hearing music played with stunning, pristine clarity while standing at the BACK of the music room;  with the Pansonic phones, I was down front, practically a hostage to the crack of the drummer's sticks, the pedaled overtones of the piano, the bassist's articulation of the strings (not merely the bass's tones).  Very likely, the same effect could be achieved with the Sony phones by using smaller ear tips (for a tighter seal) and turning up the gain (the Panasonic earphones are a trifle more "efficient"--i.e. sensitive--than the Sony phones, which require turning up the volume to reproduce the same resonating textures.  The Panasonics use a special, "ergonomic" angle along with an "angular" tip that ensures deeper insertion of the tip into the ear canal, thus accounting for some of the added "body" I was hearing in the sounds of the instruments and vocals.  Some listeners many prefer the more conventional ear tips of the Sony phones.  (Both phones provide two additional sets of tips, which are, in both cases, constructed with a stiff center, along the lines of Sony's acclaimed "hybrid silicone ear-tips").<br/><br/>I'd recommend ordering these Panasonic phones for $5-6.  If you like them, order another set before they wear out and the price goes up.  If you don't, order the Sony phones and keep the Panasonics on hand for the inevitable day that they fail (providing you don't accidentally step on them first).<br/><br/>[Ignore the aficionados' advice to "burn in" the phones, even before wearing them.  Even with high-end, costly phones, that's merely reducing the average lifetime of the phones for listening.  Moreover, either of these ultra low-priced Panasonic or Sony phones is ready to go into action from the moment you extract a pair from the box.  (Feel free to ignore the crumpled up instructions and warranty.)]</span>

<span>I really like having ear buds that don't have the rubber insert with noise cancelation. these are the most comfortable head phones for me. still have great sound but I can still tell what's going on around me. I also enjoy the wire due to my uncanny ability to lose wireless headphones. I will continue to use these until they stop working and stop being sold.</span>

<span>I've gone through a lot of earbuds over the years, and a lot of them usually last one or two months due to how cheap they are. These, however, have lasted me an average of 3 years.

<span>If you are too lazy to read my essay then I will give a quick rundown:<br/><br/>REAL Product - They are real apple earbuds, durable and people are lying<br/>Fit / Comfort - They will fit small ears amazingly and feel like nothing is there, big ears not so much<br/>Sound - Low end and mid is great. Nothing special, high end slightly lacking but its barely noticable<br/>Durability - Lasted me for 1.5 years so far, tough and will survive water (swimming, washing machine)<br/>Damage - None. They were perfect and still are right out the box<br/>Mic - Dont get for a mic. Its in the speakers themselves and are too quiet, but they are in 2 channels ig<br/>Tangling - They do get tangled but they are easy to untangle<br/>Overall - 9.5/10, get if you have small or average ears, they feel like nothing is in your ear<br/><br/>FULL DETAILED REVIEW:<br/>Im writing this to discourage the negative reviews that I see way too much about these things. They are REAL apple made products. They did not come used, broken, or anything. I bought these as I wanted some actual good earbuds that would last. I have used the samsung ones for about 2 years when I broke them, so I tried apple. I found some laying around in school (ik its gross) washed em, and they worked great. Sound quality is actually very good for earbuds, however I havent used any super expensive headphones that would blow me away and make these sound terrible in comparison. The low end or "bass" is very important to me and thankfully it is pretty loud, nothing outstanding or anything though. The High end is kindof lacking but not much, still sounds great. Mid sound is loudest, not overwhelming though, pretty good. Anyway, I lost those, so I ordered them, on Amazon. They came early, unused, undamaged, and they sound great. No complaints and they have lasted me for nearly a year. Now an issue you might have with these buds if at all are 2 things: Fit and Comfort. These will not fit everybody's ears, escpecially big ones. However, they fit in mine perfectly and within a minute I forget I even have anything in my ear, but thats just me. 2 is comfort, which some people have issues with. I think these are incredibly comfortable with the non-silicon tips. They dont hurt, but maybe thats just me. I hate the silicon tips, but some people dont. Either way, you can get used to them. Other things to mention; you can drown these in water or leave them in the wash accidentally and they will work fine. As long as their not in deep water for like over an hour, they should still work. also, Tangling is not a big problem with these. They definetly do get tangled, but they are very easy to ungtangle unlike other buds. Lastly, Microphone. I would not recomment these if you need them to have a good mic. I was surprised to test these and find out the Volume controller that has a mic label on it isnt actually a mic, the phones themselves are. And they are weird. They are wayyyyy too quiet and each but has its own channel, so you can talk into say the left bud and whoever is recieving your mic signal will hear only out the left headphone. You also have to have it so close to your mouth that you are pretty much making out with it. Besides that, they are amazing. Some people with love them, others will hate. If you have small ears, I recomment these. They come in a nice little box too. They will feel like nothing is there. 9.5/10 earbuds in my opinion. Best earbuds I have ever used. GET THEM</span>

While these sound good and connect perfectly to lightning they aren’t suited for me or my riding. Gave them to my son who loves them. So not a big deal!

<span>Headphones worked and sounded great.  I liked the soft earbuds which stayed in during workouts, but after ~4 months the volume control is broken.  The set wants to constantly turn itself all the way up.  If i turn it down after a few seconds it will turn up all the way.  Upon investigation I've noticed the wire leading into and out of the volume control toggle is loose on both sides.  Back to the old apple headphones I guess...</span>

<span>Dear Beats,<br/><br/>I bought this headset for my wife in black. It was easy to pair and you can use either the left or the right earbud by itself which is nice because when one earbuds runs out of battery you can use the other one for a few hours. The case takes a lightening adapter and charges fully regardless of what kind of power brick you’re using. For the price these are a good deal. Pairing was as easy as open the lid next to your iPhone and then follow the on screen steps. Charges fully in about a couple of hours and will last you 20+ hrs with the case. The only thing I wished it had was qi wireless charging ability otherwise, these are nice for the price.<br/><br/>Almost a month later… I am using these headsets for my M1 MBA and my iPhone 13Pro. One nice thing about this is that you can switch devices within a matter of seconds and a push of a button either on your iPhone or your MacBook. Second nice thing is that you can use the headset individually. One earbud could be in your ear and the other one in the case. It doesn’t matter which on you use first but I’ve been using the right one, depleting it, and then put it back into the case to charge when I’m not using it and switch to the left one. The case holds a good amount of charge. With average use, the case can charge the earbuds fully about twice before everything needs to be charged. Tapping on the earbuds pauses whatever you’re listening to or watching. The right bud is for increasing volume and the left bud is to decrease volume. You have to push and hold down for the volume to change. It charges via usb c which is nice. It also sound pretty good when just using it for talking. Overall, I am happy with the headsets.</span>

<span>I like these, got them for listening to music while mowing the lawn.  The battery life is great.  Sound quality is ok but I have bad hearing so most ear buds sound the same to me.  If I had a complaint it is when I lay down if I turn my head the activation button gets pushed which is annoying.  If they moved the button to the front of back of the unit it would solve that problem.  Would I buy them again? Yes, if they solved the button location issue</span>

<span>After losing my apple AirPods I was very disheartened to have to spend 300 bucks on another pair. That’s when I went out and searched for something comparable and found these. After using them for several month I have overall positive feelings about them however their is many things the future consumers of this product should know.<br/><br/>Pros:<br/>To start the price point on these is much more affordable than the airpod pros. The wireless works well and I have not had any range issues with them or issues with them randomly cutting off or disconnecting. The noise cancellation is solid but not perfect. It does it job but it does give me a fish bowl feeling when NC is turned on. The battery life is also amazing. I believe they are rated for 8 hours and I can say I can get around 6 hours out of them before the low power beep comes on.<br/><br/>Cons:<br/>With the benefit of its low price point, some corners were definitely cut. Let’s start with the spacial audio. It’s not vary clear and when turned on it fails to compare to the air pods pro, where you can literally forget you have headphones in. Secondly the microphone on these is very bad. It sounds like you’re talking through a two way radio. And finally my biggest gripe with these is that in certain situations they emit a very loud high pitched squeal. If I am holding one headphone in my hand, and close my hand, the headphone almost sounds like it has feedback and this isn’t a little it’s loud. Loud enough to hear across the room. I can also recreate this when closing the lid to my case. If I close it to slowly the feedback screech happens almost every time. I worry that this is causing damage to my headphones but I don’t know.<br/><br/>Overall I think these are great for the price but have issues and if you have the funds, go buy a pair of galaxy buds or air pod pros.</span>

<span>I got these as a test to see if the expensive side of earbuds work, I’ve tried cheap, to up to $80 ear buds. These are the first I’ve ever spent more then $100 on earbuds.<br/>I have sensory issues and loud noises make my social battery drain quickly, I have a pair of Skullcandy HASH ANC headphones but I wanted something discrete for work (I clean houses) and big headphones seem rude for every day wear.<br/>I’ve seen lots of reviews say these (beats studio pros) are best for noice cancellation and people with sensory.<br/>Problems for me:<br/>1. They fall out, the small ear plugs fit perfect they don’t hurt and they’re snug, but I bend, move around, work a sweat and the fall out. I’ve tried the medium size and they give me a headache an hour in.<br/>2. Battery life, 4 hours in after fully charged and the earbuds are a 3/4 dead, a full day cleaning can take 2-6 hours so these wouldn’t make the full 6 if I used them constantly.<br/>Good things:<br/>1. Great for on the go, the case is smooth and small easy to put in a pocket for traveling.<br/>2. Earbuds stay in even if lid is open and shook, it was one of the first things I tried and I was very surprised by the strong magnetic connection.<br/>3. Beside the short battery life it charges pretty quickly, it’s an awesome quality.<br/>Again this is just me and my sensory problems make me a little picky if you don’t sweat a lot and use them for short periods these would be great but personally not for long periods and working.<br/>If I can’t find someone to take them and like them I will be returning them, it was a great experiment but not personally fit for me :)</span>
