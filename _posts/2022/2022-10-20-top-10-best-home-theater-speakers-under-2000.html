<span>I am not a dedicated audiophile, but these speakers sound crazy good with a nice small profile so they don't dominate the room.  Super easy set up, less than 30 minutes from open box to room filling sound.  The price can't be beat either.<br/><br/>I have left the screens on the speakers, as the bare speaker colors are pretty aggressive that is probably cool for a teenage gamer but for me the speakers just blend into the background.<br/><br/>Awesome purchase, totally recommend.</span>

<span>Klipsch review<br/><br/>TL;DR this is a very very decent system, but you may have to fix the sub or go with a separate sub if you’re really wanting a “wireless sub”.<br/><br/>I was in the market for a 3.1 system for my desktop rig. So I could listen to music or watch movies and have a decent sound experience without a headset causing what I call “squeeze fatigue.”<br/><br/>I wasn’t looking to spend a whole lot, but didn’t want complete garbage either. So in my search on Amazon I found these. They were 5.1, but less than $300. If anything I would get 2 extra speakers than I needed, and Klipsch has a reputation for being quality.<br/><br/>Of course I was skeptical of these being only $289 shipped to my front door, while they are listed on Klipsch’s site for $1264.00. What this told me is they are clearing out inventory or they are defective. Reading the negative reviews, the problem was mostly the Subwoofer, but everyone else said it was decent. So I rolled the dice, assuming everyone was using the optional wireless setup, I thought worst case I would just never use the wireless link and be okay.<br/><br/>I got them, unpacked them, and was happy to see those copper spun cones Klipsch loves to boast about.<br/><br/>I hooked them up using bare 16 AWG copper wire for the main speakers, since the terminals are spring loaded gold plated terminals, and are too small for banana plugs, I just rolled with it. The other ends are banana plugged into an old Sony surround I got almost a decade ago, but still works well for a smaller setup.<br/><br/>I decided “I don’t need no stinkin wireless” and opted to use a shielded RCA cable for the Sub.<br/><br/>Then I hooked the system up to the TV Using HDMI, which has the best support for DTS in my opinion, and fired up a movie.<br/><br/>The center channel and satellite speakers sounded clear. But the Sub just wasn’t doing it for me.<br/><br/>I changed settings on the surround receiver, went through all the options on the TV for sending audio. Didn’t help. I tried the wireless setup to see if it was my RCA cable. Didn’t help. I even switched to optical and tried all of those settings. Didn’t help, then randomly it started working… Okayish. My lizard brain was telling me to think it must’ve just needed to be warmed up as a coping mechanism. I was in full cope mode.<br/><br/>So I tried the system out for a week, with mixed results. The sound came out great from the speakers. But the sub would be “meh” at best, and have random pops and/or distortion at worst. The sub was the main pain point, just as  most of the negative reviews indicated.<br/><br/>Most people would’ve tried to return them at this point. But not me. Manufacturers dream of customers like me. Instead of crying about it like others would, I started investigating the problem. I listened to music that had distortion come through the sub, but it wasn’t consistent, it was hit and miss.<br/><br/>When I’d play with the knobs and switches on the back, I’d get mixed results, thinking I’d fixed the issue when it would just come back moments later.<br/><br/>Refusing to be defeated, I kept tinkering. I wasn’t about to go through the hassle of returning a $1200 system because one component didn’t work. I would buy an amp off the shelf and hook it up to the driver if all else failed.<br/><br/>Then as I was tinkering with the cables I pulled the RCA and distortion was still coming through the sub!!!! I had a pocket of time for which the problem was presenting itself without even being hooked up to the surround system. Which told me the amp was receiving low frequency signals from one of the internal components.<br/><br/>WARNING: Do not try the following this at home!!!! I took the risk of causing damage to the electronic components and voiding my warranty (not that I trust any company to stand by their products these days… most companies would rather offload poorly designed products at cheap prices and let the chips fall where they may. After all, if you’re buying a surround system at $300 you’re probably not the demographic Klipsch thinks is their market anyway).<br/><br/>So anyway… As you can see in the pics, I took the sub apart. (And one of the cables were tight, hardly any slack. It turned out to be the front led cable.)<br/><br/>I unhooked it and looked at the board. Since this is an amp that was powered recently, I carefully discharged the caps and started unplugging wires from the wireless board (I marked the wires with blue tape after testing with a multimeter so I knew what they were doing), and then plugged it back in using just the RCA and was floored by the smooth bass that was coming out of the driver!<br/><br/>No distortion. No pops. Full sound! Not subdued and crappy like it was before!<br/><br/>So I took out the wireless board… Completely. It was glued on, so it was a little tough to remove without risking breaking it. Not that I cared, it didn’t work anyway. I removed the front LED wire, just in case they were also carrying unintended signals into the board.<br/><br/>I filled all the holes on the plate with hot glue, and put it all back together, tightening the plate screws from center out to ensure a good even seal.<br/><br/>I hooked it back up and enjoy the hell out it now. Music sounds great. Movies sound great. No random pops and distortion from some wandering low frequency signal being blasted from “who knows where”, just some smooth hardwired bass as the electronic gods intended.<br/><br/>All in all, I would only recommend this system if you’re willing to ditch the sub as is.<br/><br/>I’m more adventurous than most, and willing to do a little tinkering to fix the flaws of the sub. I was willing to chance it because the system was developed with $1200 price point in mind, it just fell short because wireless technology is often quirky and can be unpredictable, and electrical engineering isn’t a perfect science, it is literally the art of refining rocks to try to create predictable resonance fields. In audio electronics, the goal is to reproduce the original air resonance waves of the source event. Which is mind boggling that we can do that. So I give Klipsch a pass on this. It was a swing and a miss, but I thank them for the flaw that was easy for me to fix and save me a nice bundle that I can spend on some other toys.<br/><br/>Thank you for coming to my Ted Talk.</span>

<span>Yes these have “passive radiators” and they do provide an actual function.  If you don't know what passive radiators are here is the definition:<br/><br/>“In speaker design a passive radiator is an element that is designed to move sympathetically with the energy in the cabinet. They generally resemble a low frequency driver or woofer, but have no voice coil or any element to actively generate sound”.<br/><br/>These speakers are great and so reasonably priced.  I work in the music industry and I am very impressed with these cabinets.  They do taper off quite a bit below 50Hz but are rated to go down to 38Hz, however to prolong the life of the low frequency drivers they should be paired with a subwoofer so it can effectively reproduce those lower frequencies without putting the strain on the speakers low drivers.<br/><br/>Definitely recommend these!</span>

<span>I waited a couple of weeks before I reviewed these, just to get use to them, and allow a break in period.<br/>I wasn't sure at first what to think about these. My previous speakers were used for 30+years, so there was an adjustment period to get use to them.<br/>These are being used on a 5.1 system as they were designed for. My first immediate thought was the bass seemed off. To test for it, I disconnected my subwoofer. The bass response is OK, but they seemed to need just a little more "punch" to them, but overall, I don't have a complaint there.<br/>My second thought was that there seemed to be a balance issue between the woofers and the mid-driver and tweeter, so I kinda wish they had an adjustment put on them, just to give them a little more balance.<br/>I was sceptical on these when I saw the price point, the thought being that "never scimp on speakers", because cheap speakers will do just that.....sound cheap, no matter how great your system is. In this case, you'll get great speakers at an inexpensive price, and that rarely happens in the world of high end audio.<br/>I would also keep in mind what kind of music you listen to. In my case, it's classic rock, blues, and blues rock, so I listen to the high end, guitars especially. Your experience with these would be different if you listen to classical as an example.<br/>Overall, you'll get a little more than you paid for here, so, yes, I would for sure recommend these, provided you already have a subwoofer, if not, Polk does have a bundle available with the subwoofer as a part of the bundle, and they are 1-2 models up from these, so you might want to look at those, but if you have the subwoofer already, you really can't go wrong with this bundle, and I don't think you'll beat this price going with another speaker manufacturer.<br/>I still kinda wish they had an adjustment on them to balance the woofers and mid-driver and tweeter, but that's using my ears, your experience with them may be different, and once I get another equalizer, I'm sure I can make the adjustment there.<br/>So, if you're on the fence about buying these like I was, and you already have a subwoofer, these are worth it. You'll get more speaker than you paid for with these, and the sound quality is there.</span>

<span>I just wanted a cheap pair of speakers for bench testing vintage hi-fi amps and receivers, but not absolute junk.  These seemed to fit the bill at $70 pair, shipped, as it would cost as much or more to repair the blown woofer on my prior test speakers.<br/><br/>Well, these little speakers are the real deal.  They have five-way speaker binding posts so you can plug in banana jacks or go old school with stripped wire.  The grilles are removable, which is usually not seen at this price point.  While I'm not usually a fan of black vinyl cabinets, these are executed tastefully and I have no problems with the looks at all.  They have mounting holes on the backs so you can easily hang them on a wall.<br/><br/>Let's cut to the chase!  These sound fantastic!  These are speakers you can listen to all day long, unlike some of the fancy stuff out there that has a long list of specs but doesn't quite make it in real life.  You don't need a lot of power to play them, although I found that the better the amplification, the better they sounded.<br/><br/>1. Bass is very, very good for not only a small speaker but a speaker in this price category.  It took several hours before they really started singing--most brand-new speakers need a break-in period--but I cannot get over the bass response.  Now, if you play them side by side with a subwoofer-equipped system, they're not going to be able to compete; however, I cannot stop listening to them and I have a system with a subwoofer.<br/><br/>2. Overall sound is superb.  I can hear plenty of details in my favorite music that I thought only expensive speakers could capture.  There's a good sound stage, highs are not harsh or fatiguing, midrange sounds great to me.  Am I an audiophile?  Probably not, since I will never spend more than a mortgage payment on a piece of hi-fi gear and I use 12AWG Monoprice speaker cables, but I love music and I listen to it every day.<br/><br/>3. A comparison: I saved up for a pair of Wharfedale Dentons.  These are not budget speakers.  Originally retailing for $1,000 pr., they can often be had for $500 or less and are stunning, well-regarded speakers.  The Polk Audio T15s sounder better.  Yep.  I'm sure a squad of hitmen from Stereophile (and Wharfedale) are prepping their weapons as I write this, but the Dentons cannot handle bass like the Polks do.  Are the Dentons drop dead gorgeous in their veneered, bomb-proof cabinets?  Yes!  Do the Dentons sound good?  Yes, again, but I cannot listen to the Dentons very long before I put something else in their place.  They simply cannot deal with bass in a pleasing manner and yes, they've done as much breaking in as they're ever going to do.  Please understand that I'm not knocking the Dentons; they are so well-made I want to cry, but the Polks are more enjoyable to listen to.<br/><br/>4. So, what's the deal?  What's the catch?  I'm waiting for the other shoe to drop, so let's get it over with...<br/>There's no catch that I can see so far, except that these are mass-produced, black vinyl speakers.  They are not exotic and I doubt Stereophile is going to review them any time soon.  They aren't going to fill a concert hall with thundering bass because they're small bookshelf speakers.  Some audio snob types are not going to even bother to listen to a pair because they don't cost enough.  Well, their loss is our gain, my friends, because if I had known about these speakers before buying the damned Dentons (and some other fancy speakers) I could have saved $400.<br/><br/>5. Not enough bass for you?  No problem.  For $130 shipped, buy the Polk Audio PSW10 subwoofer.  I am a card-carrying bass freak (every single amp and receiver I own has the bass knob maxed out and I usually have loudness engaged as well) and this thing is a damned marvel.  It was easy to set up and yes, it will work with old amps and receivers.  You can adjust how much or how little bass it puts out, and for once in my life I DO NOT have the bass turned all the way up--that's how powerful this thing is.  You can set it on standby mode, where it's "asleep" until it senses a music signal, then it turns on and does it's thing.  That said, the T15's sound so nice on their own I'd hold off on the sub and judge for yourself.<br/><br/>I have heard many different speakers over the years, from Bose 901s to Martin Logan Prefaces to Polk Audio LSi9's, and these are absolutely the best value I've ever heard in speakers.  They are cheap enough that you can buy two pairs and have a speaker in every corner of the room.  Bass is handled very well and they sound good enough to be the main speakers in a two-channel hi-fi system.  Look at how many people have given these speakers two thumbs up!  I cannot stress how wonderful it is that Polk Audio has provided such an amazing, low-cost speaker to the general public.  I highly recommend these speakers.  Just remember to let them play for a few hours and the better the amplification, the better they'll sound.</span>

<span>It’s crazy how cheap these things have gotten for the amount of sound they produce. I set this up in our basement home theater in combo with an Epson projector (HDMI ARC audio). The room is about 30’x25’, so it’s not a small room. There is MORE than enough undistorted volume in this system to run it in our home theater… and what I mean by undistorted is there was still plenty of volume to go when testing it out. In my opinion, if you wanted a better system it would be pointless unless you jumped to $2k+. And it would still probably not be necessary, unless you were filling a huge room. We have a $2k Sonos system upstairs, this Yamaha sounds equally as good. Pull the trigger.</span>

<span>After 20 years our old system gave up. This system fits our budget and has everything you need . Only that the wire to connect the speakers were not enough. Because of our set up, this was not a plug and play scenario. We called tech support and we were connected to a rep from the Philippines and because of time difference we were connected to another rep from the Caribbean when I called the following day. Both tech were equally good. They went far and above our expectations even calling Yamaha tech the following Monday when the office opened. They did not pass us from one tech to another.

<span>This was a replacement for a Samsung system that went south!<br/><br/>Delivered July 30, 2021<br/><br/>Pros:<br/>1.  Great Sound :-)<br/>2.  Completely wired System.<br/>3.  Easy to Setup.<br/><br/>Cons:<br/>1.  The speakers that come with the system are 6 ohm speakers and the amplifier needs to be configured to use the 6 ohm speakers.  It would have been nice in the quick setup guide to point this out with instructions on setting up the system to accept the 6 ohm speakers so that you do not have an impedance mismatch.<br/>2.  The manual must be downloaded from the Yamaha site on the Internet.  If you like a printed manual you should have a laser jet printer.  The manual is 112 pages of awesome information.<br/>3.  If you have an old turntable, you need a preamp to use it to play your old records.<br/>4.  The speaker wire that comes with the system is extremely thin and I would suggest buying 16 gauge speaker wire which will have lower resistance thus having a better sound.<br/><br/>Overall:<br/>1.  Yamaha still makes great audio products.  I'm happy that Yamaha has not gone to China and that the amplifier in manufactured in Malaysia.<br/>2.  I would recommend this system to anyone who wants good audio at a good price.<br/>3.  The amplifier delivers 100 watt power to the speakers so whatever speakers you use, it will probably handle very well.</span>

<span>I recently purchased this kit to replace a problematic LG BH9431PW.  The LG claimed to support Dolby Digital Plus, but would not decode the new encoding from the Roku Amazon or Netflix channels.  The Yamaha receiver in this kit handles the DD+ output from the Amazon and Netflix channels wonderfully.<br/><br/>In case anyone is wondering, the AV Receiver included in this kit is the RX-V385.<br/><br/>Some highlights so far compared to the previous LG BH9431PW:<br/><br/>* Full Dolby Digital Plus support!<br/><br/>  Woohoo!  I am now getting Dolby 5.1 output from my Amazon and Netflix channels.  This was the number one reason for purchasing this unit.<br/><br/>* The receiver allows direct navigation to any of the inputs:<br/><br/>  We use a Logitech Harmony 650 universal remote to map all of our devices, and the LG forced it to cycle through the inputs.  This meant that, to go from our ROKU on HDMI2 to the DVR on HDMI1, the remote had to cycle forward through the other inputs like the optical, tuner, USB, and bluetooth to get back to HDMI1.  This not only meant waiting a long time with the remote pointed at the equipment, but also tended to be prone to failure if the bluetooth scanning took too long.  With the new Yamaha receiver, the remote is able to quickly switch between HDMI2 and HDMI3 with no delays or errors.<br/><br/>* The speakers use standard wire connectors.<br/><br/>  The LG had a weird, proprietary connection plug and wiring scheme, so the old speakers could not be easily re-used with a different receiver (which is what forced me into buying a complete home theater system vs just upgrading the receiver).<br/><br/>* The auto-speaker setup was nice.<br/><br/>  The unit comes with a microphone that can be hooked up to help balance the speakers for your particular viewing arrangement.  The setup program not only validates the functionality and wiring of the speakers, but will calculate the relative distances from the speaker to the viewing location to help balance the volumes of each speaker.<br/><br/>* Volume trimming between inputs.<br/><br/>  Related to speaker balancing, the unit will also let you decrease/increase the volume a bit between inputs.  This is a handy feature since our DVR volume tended to be a bit softer than our ROKU, and the tuner would blow us out of the room.  We now have the relative volume between the inputs a little closer to each other.<br/><br/>* Powered Subwoofer.<br/><br/>  The subwoofer seems to have a bit more punch than my previous setup.<br/><br/>Things that could be better:<br/><br/>* Wireless surround connection.<br/><br/>  My old LG surround speaker setup had a wireless connection between the main unit and a satellite surround base unit.  The new Yamaha forced me to run long speaker cables to the back of the room.  A pain, but at least I no longer have to run power back to that location.</span>

<span>Simply stated, this is one of the very best things I’ve ever bought on Amazon (and I’ve bought more than a few). Outstanding sound, reliable and consistent bluetooth reception with no dropouts, easy and straightforward to operate with no unnecessary functions/controls, and I easily set it up in less than 5 minutes. And once again, it’s got great sound.<br/>P.S. I love the video commercial starring Rockman. I wish he really did have his own music videos!</span>

<span>Bought this to use for my e kit , in conjunction with my edifier r1280t speakers which needed more low end,, decent for the price! It's not going to make eardrums bleed , as at max volume it distorts a bit.  ..but the combination sounds good for a small room. The remote it a little weak, not much range,but I have it behind my throne so it works for me!  I would buy it again if it holds up. Time will tell, but for now I'm pretty happy with it!</span>

<span>My ancient Durbrand sound amp that I got from Kmart in the 1990s got beat up from my two year old rat terrier whom chew the speakers wires attract to the woofer.  Nobody makes this brand anymore, which is a shame because the amplifier was so clear and loud when connected to my CRT TV set.  Try to fix it, but there is no sound out of the separate speakers.<br/><br/>Went to Amazon to see if there was still old school rca audio cable friendly sound amplifiers.  Most sound bars are just made for the current digital HDTVs, but I found this model, the Rockville RHB70, catering to my situation.  The Rockville is a combination subwoofer and regular speakers amplifier, so no longer are there a need for separate attrach left and right wired speakers.  Plus it supports Bluetooth and has a built in fm receiver.  The price is amazing at about $50, much less than most sound bars.<br/><br/>I placed the rca audio cables from my CRT TV set to the back of the Rockville amplifier.  The sound was just as excellent as the older Durbrand amp, with the bonus of no loose wires from separate speakers. The only notice I would add that the rca audio cables would not work on my modern Roku HDTV the same way.  I had to use a 3.5 mm to 2-male rca adapter audio stereo cable.  If you are old enough to remember the original Sega Genesis console where the audio wand plugged into its headphone jack, then the left and right rca cables to the receiver, it is just like that to get sound.<br/><br/>Anyways, I am very impressed by this amplifier*****</span>
