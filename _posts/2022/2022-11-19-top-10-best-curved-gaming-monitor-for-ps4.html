<span>I currently have a 32" Samsung Curved FHD 240Hz panel for gaming. Wanted another one that is smaller and thought, what the heck, can always return to Amazon if this doesn't perform. Well, I'm impressed 100%. The picture is actually better than my Samsung on COD Vanguard. FPS, smoothness and brightness are all fantastic. The panel is likely made by Samsung, not many make these actual panels in the World. Plus, the warranty is hard to pass up. It is just as good, if not better than my Samsung which was 2x the cost for 5" larger size. Buttery smooth action and does 240Hz. Just set the Hz and screen size in COD graphics settings, and my NVDIA 3080 just screams 200+fps. Really nice. Can't go wrong. If you aren't used to a curve monitor, it takes awhile, since I already had one, no biggie. Plus, it doesn't seem 5" smaller in diagonal than my Samsung 32". Don't think you can go wrong with this thing honestly.</span>

<span>Now, there's a lot of sellers on this site who market 240HZ, but the product doesn't have such capabilities. At this price point, the monitor not only hits 240HZ, but does much more, including AMD FreeSync. It has seriously improved my gameplay and is absolutely worth the money. No issues with the product at all, a perfect addition to my setup.</span>

<span>RE: AOC C27G2Z<br/><br/>This is the best gaming monitor for 240Hz FHD period.  I read a lot of reviews about QHD, 2K and 4K but I’m not talking about casual gaming, I’m talking about competitive gaming where FHD is king.  This monitor has it all a great picture, incredible speed and .05ms MPRT which is most important.  This monitor supports 3 color profiles including 120% sRGB which exceeds many IPS monitors.  IPS monitors are great but just not (ideal) for competitive gaming the 1000:1 contrast ratio produces a washed picture, HDR fixes that but needs to be supported for each game and many users have reported that it creates problems while gaming including increased lag.  So, if you want incredible graphics, killer speed and minimum lag then this monitor is for you.  Oh, I forgot to mention and a GREAT PRICE!</span>

<span>firstly the monitor is great. i purchased 1 last year and i love everything about it. so much so,, that for black friday (November 27th) i decided to purchase another one. i was told that it would take a little over a month to deliver,, but since it was such a good deal and a xmas present to boot, i said heck yeah. now i just received a message stating that it will be delayed possibly up to another month or more. meanwhile i have seen the monitor being sold and shipped by amazon (the retailer i purchased from) a couple of weeks ago. i could have paid full price and received it before xmas. but it seems like because the black friday deal was to good to be true,, here i wait again. it leaves me wondering if some deals really are there just to drive up traffic or will i actually receive the monitor that really is a great monitor... so to sum it all up. the monitor is a great bang for buck, if you get one... to be continued</span>

<span>I purchased these monitors on prime day and took a chance on them so granted I kinda knew what I was getting myself into. Prior to purchasing these I had two flat screen 20" Acer monitors that I had been using for my home office setup, they still work great but it was time for an upgrade.<br/><br/>Overall the monitors are quite nice and they already fit my vesa mounts perfectly without any issue, so set up was very easy but then I noticed...the power bricks were differently sized...I checked the monitors themselves and they are indeed the same model and came in the same packaging BUT WHY ARE THE POWER BRICKS DIFFERENT!? Not only that but the length of the cables are different as well...the right Larger brick being longer (but feeling very cheaply made) and the left being short but seemingly good quality. Can I get the same sized brick thoooo?<br/><br/>The power bricks aside...gaming quality, picture quality, and screen quality are all satisfactory for my needs and doesn't break the bank. Again setup was easy ( I already had the Vesa mounts and arms, these do not come with them just in case you were wondering) and I'm happy with my new monitors.<br/><br/>One last thing and I'm not sure who this goes to. I did make sure to snap and picture and video just in case the monitors were busted during transport. The box in the picture shows that the monitors were basically put in a larger box but no additional padding was included. When I got the box...the monitors were just shuffling around in there and I did not see any labels saying that these could be fragile.</span>

<span>I have tried and compared several 32" VA and IPS 1440p 144Hz+ monitors and out of all of them, the ASUS TUF 32" 1440p 165Hz (VG32VQ1B) has the best balance of cost, performance, and quality.<br/>The Pros:<br/>Deep blacks, good contrast (superior contrast to an IPS panel), great color for a VA panel, excellent refresh rate (165), quality materials, lots of fine tuning options, gentle curve for immersion.<br/>Cons: like most all other VA panels, this one is not immune to ghosting (google if you do not know what that is), black screen uniformity is Meh (more on that below), colors are a little subdued but better after calibration, orange stand by light is pretty bright.<br/><br/>The panel that came the closest to this one, for me, was the Samsung G5 32" but the G5 is dimmer than this one. There are brighter panels out there in this range - the Gigabyte M32QC for example - but this is one of the brighter VAs.<br/><br/>Overall, I am happy with this for gaming, media, and music production work. I will let you know that I am returning the first one I received as after a few hours of use, it developed a hot spot in the upper left corner. I game in a dim room so it is very noticeable. I am hoping the next one is just fine. I really like this unit. The only thing that could be better is the color and light output. It claims to be an HDR monitor but really it just can accept the HDR signal. Its not really bright enough to do true HDR. I wish they were not marketing it as an HDR panel. If you are on the hunt for a good HDR display, you are going to have to shell out more money for a next tier unit.<br/><br/>Good luck on your monitor search.</span>

<span>I bought this monitor to upgrade from my old HP 60hz monitor and I expected this monitor to be good but it exceeded my expatiations by a lot. The price is also very good in my option because similar ones I was looking at were $350USD+. It comes with 1 HDMI cable and 1 DisplayPort cable so I did not even have to go buy them sperate. Overall a 10/10 product and I will buy again if ever needed!</span>

<span>I had to purchase this three times. The first product came with a patch of dead pixels, and the second product never arrived - it was dropped off at a USPS at midnight while they were closed and who knows what happened to it before they opened in the morning. The third I actually purchased from Microcenter at a $20 markup (which had some surface grime that was difficult to wipe away in exactly the same spot that the patch of dead pixels was in for the first monitor that I received, so I'm thinking there is some manufacturing trauma involving that point). The monitor is also difficult to get out of the box. -1 star for quality control and all these random issues.<br/><br/>Color is bright and vibrant and all the specs that I want are there, but there is a lot of smearing of dark objects that I eventually could not fully fix or get over. From viewing many other curved monitors up for display at my local microcenter and looking up their specs, other curved VA monitors were just dull and not bright enough. I was split between this one and the Gigabyte G32QC, but the G32QC had worse smearing according to RTINGs. So I believed (and still believe) that this is the best curved 32 inch QHD 144+Hz curved VA screen below $350. Turning up shadow boost to level 3 while leaving the Trace Free option at 60 were the best settings for me to reduce dark smearing without introducing inverse ghosting. However, it was always still very much there and although it wasn't necessarily distracting (especially in FPS), it was very noticeable when I wasn't so focused on the action or while I was using my computer it for anything else. I don't think it made it functionally/practically worse, but it just gave it a cheaper feel, and it wasn't something I could really love. When a flat IPS LG Ultragear G-SYNC compatible monitor with identical specs came out heavily discounted at $320, I had to switch over. I initially really wanted the curved aspect of the VG32VQ, which did make viewing the corners and sides of the screen more comfortable, but overall it wasn't worth the smearing. After returning back to a flat 32 inch screen, I realized that the difference in comfort of viewing the edges was not as big as I made it out to be. I tried hyping myself up to want to like the VG32VQ by appreciating that curvature, but ultimately it wasn't that big of a deal to begin with for a 32 inch screen. -1 star for smearing<br/><br/>If you're really interested in a curved screen, it might still be worth it to go on the journey I did and live with one for a week or so, but ultimately you might choose to eventually go for something like a gigabyte M32Q instead (or an ultragear if it goes on sale again, which is essentially identical to a M32Q besides providing G-SYNC). Ultimately, this monitor is not bad and is a 4 star monitor as long as I didn't have to go through all that trouble to get a good working monitor. The smearing does make it feel somewhat cheap and although it wasn't enough to be functionally distracting, it was enough to return it in favor of an IPS panel that was priced similarly.</span>

<span>I have two complaints with this monitor. The first is my fault. I didn't know curved screens are not for fps best for simulators and clearly TV or movies. The second issue I have with this monitor is it will randomly turn on at night if not placed in standby. Company was helpful over the phone but couldn't figure the issue. Otherwise it's great quality 4 stars is fair at this price point. Great for a casual gamer or a beginner set up.</span>

<span>Bought this on impulse during Prime Day 2022.  It's clear, bright and beautiful.  It took me a while to get used to the extra wide, curved design but once I did, I really began to appreciate the new visual perspective with my gaming.  There are quite a few features on it, and it has a nice red backlight.  Decent cable management in the back, and comes with both a tabletop stand and wall-mount option.<br/><br/>The only reason I give it 4/5 starts is the integrated speakers - GREAT feature, but very muffled and loses a lot of dynamic leveling.  It is clear, but since this is designed as a visual appliance and not an audio one, I feel as though the audio aspect of the monitor pales in comparison to other displays that feature integrated audio.  Though, I may be biased considering the LG QLED I also purchased on Prime Day has by far some of the best audio output I've experienced without a home theater setup.<br/><br/>Great investment if you're looking for crisp, clear and relatively affordable gaming display.  Only minor drawback is the audio.</span>

<span>I bought this monitor for work 2 months ago as I became tired of looking at my small laptop screen. The size of this is perfect for having two programs up at the side by side without having an extra monitor. I am not gaming on this monitor, so I have yet to test the gaming experience. The colors however are a little bit off and you definitely see some ghosting effects when moving your mouse or dragging programs around. With the stand that comes with it, you cannot adjust the height of the monitor, just the tilt. I paired it with a mounting arm to help with that. For work, I have no major complaints as it serves its purpose.</span>

<span>My place of business sent two of the monitors to me for my home office. I was very surprised at the nice quality of the image. I do not experience any lag but I am not a gamer so I couldn't speak to how well they perform under those circumstances. I liked them so much I bought two more for my wife's office. if you're a gamer I would check out other reviews but if you are using them for general office applications they are great.</span>

<span>Perfect size for my desk. Good picture quality with HDMI cable, going to try DVI to HDMI connector to see if it can get even better.?. Full 1080p is good, but I think I'm spoiled by 4K TVs - should have thought about a 1440 capable monitor first. Nonetheless, a fine entry curved monitor.

<span>Monitor performance once I got to work is fine.  Not a superb monitor from a quality perspective, but I think it offers a great value for the price you pay.  I am not a gamer or a programmer, but I do stare at the monitor 10-11 hours a day for my job, so having a large screen helps.  Having a slight curves monitor also adds a nice aesthetic to the office.  The picture quality and the crispness of the fonts are fine for office work, and I have no complaints.<br/><br/>Right out of the box, the monitor failed to work properly.  As soon as I booted up my work laptop and logged in to the network, a screeching sound (like a high pitch squealing noise at different tones) and a random popping noise came through the monitor speaker as the screen went blank.  The on/off buttons in the back failed to respond, and I ended up unplugging the monitor from the power and disconnected the HDMI cable.  I plugged back in the cable after a few minutes and tried again, and this time instead of the screeching sound and the popping noise, the monitor started switching color swatches - red to green to blue to white to black and repeat.  Once again, none of the buttons worked, so I had to unplug the power and the HDMI.  I tested the HDMI cable, and it works fine.  I tried again, and this time, it worked.  I was able to set up the monitor as desired, and I had no issues.  I am not sure what happened at the start, but the monitor is now functioning as expected.</span>

<span>After finally purchasing a couple MiniPC's for both business and personal use, and using an old LCD 21" Wide Screen Monitor I had, I was finding that I must be spoiled by my 4K TV because the picture on that monitor which I thought was wonderful, just seemed so dull and it did not support 4K which I have come to love to watch 4K videos etc.<br/><br/>I wasn't really sure what monitor to get, but I wanted something much larger, supported 4K, and that was at a very reasonable price. I did a lot of searching Amazon's product lists for monitors, and I came across this monitor, and I noticed that it was a curved screen. While I have never owned a curved screen anything, I had seen them at the local electronics store and was darn impressed. So I was very curious about this monitor because it had all the specs I was looking for, at least 27", Wide Screen, Support for 4K, Native Resolution of 1920 x 1080, LED, and had a curved screen. When I also noticed that it was a Samsung, I was pretty excited to learn more because I have always had very good luck with Samsung products and in fact, I have only had one Samsung product ever fail, and that was a mobile phone that should have stopped working years ago with what It went through.<br/><br/>Not knowing much about monitors these days, I started reading the reviews that were written on this monitor and I asked the community a couple questions. The answers I got back to my questions sealed the deal for me. Everyone who responded had nothing but great things to say about this monitor and provided me in info I needed. So I decided to go for it.<br/><br/>When it got here, unfortunately the first one had a broken screen. It appeared that it was packaged that way since the packaging was factory sealed but the packing was broken on the inside. Needless to say I returned it but Amazon really stepped up to the plate and sent me a replacement next day, so I was only delayed by 1 day getting to use it. Because the first monitor came with a broken screen, I am going to assume that the screen may be a bit on the frgile side as my old monitor has been dropped, and the LCD screen never had any issues, I don't know jf the screens on LED monitors are more easily broken, or If this was something that someone really dropped hard before packaging, for this reason I gave the durability 4 stars)<br/><br/>Setup was a breeze! Just had to put 1 screw to put the base stand together, and that was it. The stand is about the only thing I really don't like because the base that sits on the desk is an upside down chevron shape, which sticks out in front of the monitor a few inches. This makes putting it on a small desk where your keyboard would be in front of it a bit of a pain because the keyboard has to be pulled closer to me and just gets in the way to me. I managed to get around that by putting the monitor up on a little shelf I made out of a box and an old Laptop lap desk that I had. It perfectly raises the monitor by about 4-5 inches, and let's me push the keyboard further back to where I now have more room on my desk.  (Images added to show the base and how I worked around the chevron styled base to give me more room).<br/><br/>The monitor has one HDMI port and one Display Port. Now I am not familiar with the Display Port, but all my devices are HDMI, so plugging in a PC is simple. In fact, I have 3 MiniPC's that I need to connect to this monitor so I bought a 5 port HDMI switch. This allows me to easily switch between each MiniPC with just a click of a button.<br/><br/>The picture on this monitor is absolutely phenomenal!  Once I plugged in the HDMI plug, turned on the monitor, it automatically scanned for the signal which it found right away and WOW! What a gorgeous picture. The colors are very bright and vibrant. The dynamics between the Black and White colors are stunning and the color definition is very vivid. For never using a curved screen before on a computer monitor, I am very impressed. It almost immerses you in to the picture and almost gives it a extra dimensional view, almost 3D in nature... The thing I worried most about with a curved screen was is there going to be any distortion with a curved screen and I am happy to say. "Absolutely Not!". The images looks perfectly flat, but because of the curve, it pulls the outer edges our of your peripheral vision and closer to your focused view when looking straight forward.<br/><br/>Learning how to use the toggle button on the back for adjusting the settings van take a bit of getting used to, however, at this point, I haven't really needed to use any of the options other then Sleep and Shut Down as the defaults seem to be perfect for my setup.<br/><br/>Unfortunately this monitor does not have built in speakers however, if you have speakers connected to you computer or use a set of Bluetooth Speakers you will be just fine.<br/><br/>Overall my impression of this monitor is fantastic! The picture quality is stunning, and the size with the curves screen is awesome. I would recommend this monitor to anyone who wants an excellent monitor for home or office at a more then reasonable price. While I have not used the monitor for gaming, I have used a monitor that has the same 4ms refresh rate and that has the same native resolution  of1920 x 1080 and that monitor is over 10 years old and still holds up today, so I can only imagine that this monitor would be perfectly fine for today's games.  I am definitely glad that I went ahead and purchased this monitor, and should I need to replace the monitor that I amusing as  a secondary monitor, I will likely purchase another one of this model!  Again, Highly recommended and over all this monitor gets a full 5 Stars from me! ~</span>

<span>So I have a M1 MacBook Air. I tried the whole multi-monitor set up, but I couldn't get it to work. I decided to just go with a single ultra-wide, and browsing on amazon I saw this. For the the price I felt it would be a good monitor to try. So I have just hooked it up and have been using it for about 20-30 minutes or so. Here are my initial impressions. It was a simple plug and play. I didn't have to mess with resolution settings on the MacBook or anything. I was worried that maybe the screen would possibly be too small. But I would say it was just right for what I was going for. I like the display quality and as mentioned it is a nice size if you are pairing it with the MacBook Air (I have the 13 inch). I noticed that the screen comes with built it speakers so I gave them a try. They are pretty thin on the sound I would say. Cool in a pinch I suppose, but my MacBook sounds much better. Also, when I first hooked up the screen it gave me a weird vertigo feeling. I am not sure what that was about, but I dropped the hz down from 100 to 60. Not sure if that even made a difference or not, but I will say that it is not bothering me now as I am writing this. I also notice that there is a very faint line across the bottom of the screen but you have to look very hard to see it. Could just been my screen, and it could possibly go away. All in all for the price I would say that I am very happy with the purchase. For the price I would say that it is a good buy. I would recommend it. I have to say I am not going to use it for gaming or anything. Just perhaps working from home, so using the Microsoft apps; word, excel, outlook, and etc. Oh yeah, and also some lo-fi and web browsing in my down time.  Hopefully this helps others if they have any thoughts or concerns. P.S. I think the blue lights in the back are a nice touch. Perhaps in the future they can make those RGB and you can adjust them in the settings on the display.</span>

<span>Monitor is great, works perfectly fine. I like the colors. Watching video is not comfortable on this monitor because most streaming websites do not have high resolution. So your videos would be 1920 x 1080 resolution and black lines on the side. Most games can be set to 2560 x1080 so you are good on that. I’m happy with my purchase.</span>

<h2 style="text-align: center;">FAQS</h2>
<h3><h3>Can you use a curved gaming monitor with a PS4?</h3></h3>
    

Yes, you can use a curved gaming monitor with a PS4, but it may not function as intended. The PS4 is not optimized to work with curved monitors, so some features may not work correctly.
<h3><h3>What kind of monitor do you need for PS4?</h3></h3>
    

A monitor that is compatible with the PS4 is needed in order to use the system. The PS4 supports HDMI, so a monitor with an HDMI port is recommended.
<h3><h3>Is a curved monitor good for console gaming?</h3></h3>
    

A curved monitor is not good for console gaming because the curvature can distort the image.
<h3><h3>What size monitor is best for PS4?</h3></h3>
    

A 27-inch monitor is the ideal size for a PS4. It will give you plenty of screen real estate to play your games on, and the larger size will make it more immersive. If you're looking for something smaller, a 24-inch monitor is also a good option.
