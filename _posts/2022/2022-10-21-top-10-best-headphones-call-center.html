<span>After buying and returning a large variety of headsets I have settled on these. My primary drivers were extremely light weight and noise cancelling mic. The mic is decent on the noise cancelling, but not as good as higher price point Jabra headsets. But they are very very lightweight, and that was huge for me. I can actually avoid having them put any weight on the top of my head and just have them stay in place by resting on my ears. Any amount of pressure on the top of my head gives me a headache, so these are the winner for delivering dual ear, decent mic, and no weight on my head.</span>

<span>I have not idea what product is being reviewed by some of the negative reviewers. Certainly not the Jabra 2400 II. I hate wearing headphones or put anything in my ears, but I do a lot of telehealth work with Zoom and I used to have trouble being understood. Part of it, I am sure, is my Southern-Hungarian accent, but most of it is the poor quality sound picked up by my top-of-line webcam. Got the Jabra 2400 II and my professional life improved instantly. They are lightweight – important for someone who is in meetings 8-9 hours a day, fit well, are adjustable, and comfortable to the point that I forget I have them on. The sound is clean for speech, YouTube, and even music. I am told that my voice comes across clearly at the other end. I highly recommend it for everyday office use.</span>

<span>Pros:<br/>1 - Docking stand has battery backup (like ear buds do)<br/>2 - Sound quality is superb (nobody has every complained or even noticed I'm using a headset)<br/><br/>Cons:<br/>1 - Awkward to put on because earpiece doesn't pivot (rigid headband)<br/>2 - On/Off control is on the microphone boom (awkward to turn off)<br/>3 - Sometimes cuts in and out if phone is on the opposite side of your head than earpiece.<br/><br/>Comments:<br/>My previous headset (MPOW Trucker Pro) literally fell apart after nearly 3 years of service and since they stopped making that model I went looking for something inexpensive but good.  In terms of sound quality I find this headset better but comfort is a step down because it's more rigid mostly because the metal is thicker (stronger is not always better).<br/><br/>The best feature of this headset is the charging dock because it has a built-in battery to charge the headset and the magnet that holds the headset in place is strong and makes a positive connections so you don't have to fumble with it.<br/><br/>Honestly, I really hate the on/off switch being on the stalk because you have to grip it which moves the boom away from optimal position.  This probably isn't a big deal for most people but I prefer turning off the headset after each call because most of my calls are very short and I only use it for longer calls.  I'm not taking a star off for that but for...<br/><br/>Let's talk about comfort.  This is by no means an uncomfortable headset but it is super awkward to put on.  Because it is quite rigid (not a bad thing in and of itself), when you put it on, it's always crooked and you have to use two hands to get it to rest flat on your ear.  Of course the person you're talking to can hear the noise and although they say nothing, it's a little unprofessional.  Also, when you end a call, having to press a button that is literally attached to the microphone will cause yet another noise for the person you're talking to.<br/><br/>In the end, I'm probably whining about stuff that's meaningless, for most of you normal folks so I highly recommend it for it's overall quality.<br/><br/>Thanks for reading.</span>

<span>I ordered the Jabra because I need to be on calls while walking the dog in the yard, and every other manufacturer's product didn't cut it. Forget Bluetooth, could barely walk out the door with that. Even some DECT devices didn't work so well, and one was a ratsnest of wires. This one has a clean base, wire connections, interfaces the boom mute nicely with Zoom and Teams, and has really good distance. My complaints are that the on-the-ear earpieces are uncomfortable long term and the battery life isn't terrific. But overall the best choice I've tried.</span>

<span>Engage 65 is a Very good headset. Range is very good. I can leave the house and put the garbage out by the street and not lose connection. The reason I bought this was for the lighted mute button on the base. It lights up when on mute and is easy to turn on and off from the base. I can ensure I am on mute. There is also a mute on and off button on the mic boom, so you can change mute while walking around. The headset makes a noise periodically to confirm you are on mute. This could be annoying at first but I got use to it. And it helps ensure i am on mute if I am wandering around the house. The headset also states “mute on” and off when changing mute. This confirms you are on and off. I did add a mic sock over the microphone to reduce wind and breathing noises. Sound quality is very good and the mic works well. It also takes the mute off most of my webex meetings, which avoids the double muting issue. For some reason it is not always synced up for every meeting. In those cases I just reference the headset base light for mute. Jabber VOIP link works well with phone calls.</span>

<span>Initially I purchased a headset from another manufacture which only supported a desk phone. Buy my employer finally moved everyone over to teams and working with a wired headset was too burdensome.<br/><br/>Thus I purchased this headset to add the capability of working with the Microsoft Teams app. In fact it does that function very well, but I also found that the desk phone connection is also has far less noise compared to my former headset.<br/><br/>Point in fact if the Engage 75 wasn't so much more expensive I would have purchased that unit to pickup Bluetooth to my cellphone.<br/><br/>All that said the 65 is comfortable to wear, easy to dock for charging and has limited but useful configuration options.</span>

<span>***Compatible with: Cisco Jabber, Teams, Zoom***<br/>I'm sure it's compatible with other softphones and software apps (and can be used with many desk phones too), but those are the 3 I use daily at work.  I wanted a high quality comfortable wireless headset, since I'm wearing it around 45 hours a week, and that is what I got.<br/>1. It is "plug and play" with the above, I didn't have to go in and manually change my microphone or speaker settings at all, or download anything to make it work properly.<br/>2. The level of in-ear volume, when tested, got up to "ear splitting", lol.<br/>3. Passive noise cancellation in the earpieces means I can still hear what's going on around me with my coworkers, which is important at my job.<br/>4. The noise cancellation in the mic is acceptable but not the BEST.  Some background nose is still audible to my clients. I understand that this is adjustable according to the user manual, but I haven't gotten around to testing it yet.<br/>5. The mute button on the mic and being able to tap my earpiece to answer or end a call is very handy.<br/>6. I have my headset on all day (around 9 hours) and I did test to see - the battery lasts the whole day without having to dock and charge, although it will fast-charge quite a bit if I put it on the dock during my lunch hour.<br/>7. No ear or head fatigue even after wearing all day, super comfortable and light.<br/>8. I am now free to move around the office and am no longer chained to my desk.  I tested the connection and it held all the way to the break room to refill my coffee.<br/>*This headset is EXPENSIVE.*  I'm not shy about investing in quality when it is necessary though. My last headset was much less costly but died after 6 months, was wired so I couldn't move around much, and wasn't nearly as comfortable as this one - with lots less features as well.  So far I am very happy with my purchase. I'll update as necessary if anything changes.  I did buy the offered warranty with 3 years of coverage for around $35 as well.</span>

<span>If you are concerned (we were) that this set which comes with a USB connection would (or would not) work with an iPad or iPhone (iOS), fear not.  However. Repeat: However, you need to purchase an adaptor for the iPad that allows the only input on the iPad to be connected to a device that will allow a standard USB connection (plus the ability to keep the iPad charged).<br/><br/>If you get one of these "gender bender" converters (we bought the LENTION USB-C Multi-Port Hub with 4K HDMI Output, 4 USB 3.0, Type C Charging Adapter Compatible 2020-2016 MacBook Pro ) these wired "phones+mic" work great and, more importantly, sound great.  Your caller won't believe how good you sound (we did get the one with the foam shield over the microphone tip). We use this for MicroSoft Teams and Zoom calls and it is a big step up from another great product, an 'emeet' speakerphone that we were using (that was good, this is better).<br/><br/>Highly recommended.  We can't comment on any of the wireless products, but this wired headset is a 10 (or 5-stars).</span>

<span>I ordered my first pair several years ago through work when the company was big on Skype.  They were recommended by our IT department.  The headsets were simply great.  Just plugged them in and they worked with no drama.  Light weight, high quality, could hear myself talking.  Couldn't ask for more.  I bought a second set on my own to have a travel set and for retirement.  I never had a communication care in the world with my Leitner's even with so many Zoom calls due to Covid.  But, I carelessly let the cord dangle precariously over my paper shredded and the paper shredder, being high quality as well, managed to eat the cord.  I tried a cheaper headset for a few months but simply couldn't adjust to them, didn't like them.  I had to come back for another Leitner set.  I worked my entire career in quality positions.  I was brought up with the notion of buying the highest quality you can afford so you only have to buy once or at least a lot less often.  This headset meets my quality standards.</span>

<span>After numerous complaints regarding sound quality I decided to buy my own headset rather than go through possible replacement from my company. In reading product info about them I decided to buy this one because it comes with a 5 Year Warranty, plus no matter who I work for in the future I will have this headset. I have done years of work which required use of a headset to talk on the phone. This is hands down the best headset I have ever had. Noise Cancellation is excellent. There is no feedback from my mic. I would recommend it to any company or individual looking to buy headsets. In fact, companies would save money if they would start out with this caliber of a headset in the first place versus some of the others that are cheaper and wear out quicker. Thanks Leitner for a quality product.</span>

<span>This was a worthwhile purchase. I bought it for use at a call center where I was working so I wouldn't have to worry about trying to find a headset everyday.<br/><br/>Pros:<br/>- Ambidexterity<br/>- Clear sound/mic quality (no static, no background hissing)<br/>- Noise cancelling<br/>- Volume control and mute on/off button<br/>- Lapel clip<br/>- Good cord length<br/>- Incredible price<br/>- Multiple options for headsets<br/>- Flexible mic positioning<br/>- COMFORTABLE<br/><br/>Honestly, the only "complaints" I could give are these: it's strictly a USB and the rotation of the mic gets loose after a while. What I mean by those is that the headset couldn't be used for an iPhone or something like that because of the USB, but this sort of headset is usually used at a computer anyway, so that doesn't particularly bother me. Also, where the mic rotates on the headset can start to get loose and fall to the lowest position after a while (sort of like how the bands on cheap sunglasses will become loose instead of firm). However, the flexibility of the mic is such that this isn't even that much of a problem.<br/><br/>In essence, this product was EXACTLY as advertised, at least in my experience.<br/><br/>I love the pricing on this headset. I am the kind of person who researches for ages before buying a product. I saw many other headsets that only had SOME of the features that this one had, and those headsets were far more expensive. So I appreciated that, as someone who can't afford super-expensive things, I was able to find an excellent quality headset without basically setting my wallet on fire.<br/><br/>I also love the mono and stereo options; I bought the monaural headset because I'm deaf in one ear anyway, so there really wasn't a point to me having both headphones. Additionally, I love that even if you get the monaural mic, you still have the option of which ear to wear it on because the mic can rotate. (Many of the more expensive headsets I looked at couldn't even do that!)<br/><br/>The sound and mic quality were excellent; there was no background hissing or static. We had to listen to our calls as part of our testing for quality at the call center, and my mic sounded excellent on playback.cAs for the noise cancelling, it is excellent. If anyone has worked at a call center before, then you KNOW how loud it gets! I was able to focus on my calls because I wasn't distracted by outside noises.<br/><br/>Also, this headset is COMFORTABLE. I've tried using actual headphones before, and I can only wear them for a few minutes before I have to take them off because they give me a major head-ache and jaw-ache. I'm talking about those huge ones that completely swallow your ears. Yeah, those are awful for me (and one of the major reasons I only use in-ear earbuds). These, on the other hand, are super comfortable, and I can wear these for hours before I get even the slightest tinge of discomfort.<br/><br/>Basically, I still use this headset, especially if I'm recording something (like when I'm playing games or something; it actually makes a decent PC gaming headset!) I was at the call center for long hours, using this headset non-stop during work for at least 6 months or more and it's still working like when I first opened it.<br/><br/>I love this headset, and I would definitely recommend it.</span>

And I've actually RE-DONE a voicemail message I did with my home phone to a remote # with this headset using google voice because with this headset ... it sounds like you are RIGHT THERE with the listener.

<span>This is a great set of headphones for the office.<br/><br/>I bought the single ear (USB Mono), because in the office I need to know what's going on around me.<br/>I used it for VOIP calls using Skype, Viber and Google Voice<br/>The connection is USB digital sound, instantly recognized without having to install drivers or CD's<br/><br/>The cable has an inline switch, that allows me to increase / decrease the speaker volume, and a mute on/off switch for the microphone, the switch is located about  a couple of feet away from the headphones, which makes it easily accessible to my hands.<br/><br/>The sound clarity is great; so far everyone that I have talked to using the headphones, have told me that they can hear me clearly without background noises, or distortions.<br/><br/>The headphones are light weight, the band is adjustable, and the ear pad is comfortable. The ear pad rest over my ear, without enclosing it. That is something I appreciate, since larger pads that cover the ears have a tendency to feel hot after few minutes of usage.<br/><br/>The microphone is flexible and it allows me to move it closer or father away from your mouth, which is a way of adjusting the sound for the listener in the other end.<br/>The cable is long; the headphones are plugged in the rear of my PC which is on the floor.<br/><br/>The cord has a clip that you may attach to your shirt, for more comfort.</span>

<span>This has great clarity speaking and listening - the price was right and I am super pleased - recovering from hand reconstruction and I can’t hold the phone in my left hand but if I hold it in my right hand then I can’t write</span>

<span>Can hear clearly, adjust the volume, work with my hands while on the phone.  Easy "quick detach" on the cord for when you need to rush off and get more coffee!  I was afraid a cordless model would have issues, plus, my ears are so small, things won't stay on them the way they're supposed to.  I like this comfy ear piece that fits over my whole ear.</span>

<span>Appears to be well made, solid construction, should last a long time, unlike some other headset brands I have owned in the past. Sound quality and volume are generally quite good. I can hear others clearly, others can hear me clearly, and I do not have to speak loudly at all for the mic to pick up my voice.<br/><br/>Although the sound volume and clarity seem quite good, the "tone" of the sound through the earpiece feels a little "pinched" to me...as if I am hearing voice through an AM radio...if that makes any sense. It does not quite sound like "full-spectrum" sound from, say, audio music headphones. Of course it is a mono headset, not stereo, because there is only one earpiece, so I know that much, but the tone of the sound through the earpiece strikes me as less than outstanding. This may have been a design choice of the manufacturer to ensure that conversations through the headset could still be heard when sitting in a noisy call center, so maybe they designed the earpiece speaker to focus on the narrow mid-range frequencies used by voice, and they reduced the bass and treble frequencies. I'm using this headset in a quiet office environment, so outside noise is not an issue.<br/><br/>I love that I can snap the headset in and out of other OvisLink adapters quickly and easily, so I can use the same headset with a Polycom Soundpoint Pro desk phone and also a standard Android smartphone (need the special adapter from OvisLink to fit the smartphone).<br/><br/>Overall, I think it's a high quality headset and I expect it to last a long time.</span>

<span>I thought having two earpieces would help but the max volume is low, and my voice doesn't come through the headphones. I'll keep looking.</span>

<span>I've owned a number of these headsets over the years, different styles and brands. This is far and away the worst of the lot. No volume control, no mute feature, and the connection is so bad that every conversation is full of static, and if I move just right, the connection ends altogether, so that it's generally easier to just unplug it and hold the phone normally. Since hearing challenges and the arthritis in my hands are the main reasons I use one of these, this one is completely useless.</span>
