<span>Nice quality ear cup improvements over the gen 1 versions, but the head band itself is rather short so for my large head with the ear cups extended to the max the head phones barely rest on my ears... now don't get me wrong they sit there comfortably and I love the fact that on these newer gen 2 headphones the ear cups can be removed and cleaned unlike the previous that were just glued on, but they still sound great they feel lighter than the gen 1's their long cable can accommodate most and the 3.5 earphone jack works with most systems. If you need a decent low budget gaming headset I recommend these just careful they are plastic and I know some people can get a bit aggressive so take care but comfort and sound is not bad and for 60$ I'm not complaining.</span>

<span>Was genuinely so concerned and pissed off that this wasn’t working. Then I realized, you have to push the cord slightly harder into the headphone Jack till you hear it click. If that doesn’t work, adjust the volume settings on your system and you should be set. Great product, awesome quality, very comfortable and the noise from my end is perfectly clear.</span>

<span>Saw this headset dropped to $20 from $60. Picked up it as my last headsets (two logitech G series) both broke off on one ear and ended up being dangly.<br/><br/>The packaging is pretty barebones. You get the headset, a few manuals and a 3.5mm cable where a longer end goes into the headset and the other goes into your 3.5mm jack of choice. In this case I will be using a PS5 controller. The headset is powered by the controller - you simply plug it in and you'll be able to hear everything. I believe it is stereo sound when plugged into the microphone. This can be improved to 7.1 surround sound with a mixamp or some other attachments that don't come with the headset I believe.<br/><br/>The sound is good. I can hear enemies and footsteps clearly. I've used this headset to play MW2 and I will attribute my poor performance to the sound in this game being horrible lol. The headset sounds fine from what I can tell after using it to browse on my PC and listen to music as well. I just suck.<br/><br/>The mic is absolute trash. I would not buy this headset with the intent to communicate with others. If my game volume is too loud, it will simply bleed through the mic. For now I am sticking with the default PS5 controller microphone.<br/><br/>That being said, the build quality looks solid - I feel that this headset will last longer than my two Logitechs. Astro has long been a brand I have nothing but good things to say about starting with their A40s back in the early Halo days, so when I saw them offering a "budget" headset I had to give them a try and so far I am happy. I would definitely purchase another one in a year or two if this one ends up breaking and the product is offered at the same price point.</span>

<span>This is a good headset, good bluetooth capabilities. The sound quality and the comfortability is the best part of this headset. The headset doesn't even feel like its on your head sometimes. Now.. for the eh parts of the headset. After 3 months of use the headset was showing some signs of wear which was daunting for an item that cost me 200$. A week after noticing the signs of wear the right side earphone muff thing broke off completely. I contacted amazon and they told me to talk to steel series themselves, I did and they were noooo help but, amazon said if they didn't help me that they would. Amazon replaced my headset and made me feel heard. Amazon is a great company and I will always choose Amazon when doing online orders.  The headset they gave me to replace the broken one has been going strong for almost half a year now. Doubt I received a dud as I've seen that this is a recurring issue with other consumers of this product. Overall 4/5 only because Amazon saved the day. IF the headset didn't break the first time this would be a 5/5.</span>

<span>After using these for about a month now I can say this really is a great headset. I used to be a loyal Turtle Beach customer, 3 headsets in a row over more than a decade, but since they haven’t released a new flagship in awhile, I decided to finally give the competition a try.<br/><br/>For starters the construction is great as you should expect from a $150+ pair of headphones. I’ve always been wary of the dual band (solid segment and adjustable strap or part) because it essentially makes 2 points of failure in addition to possible balance issues but thankfully, the 9X has a metal support band and it feels fantastic. It keeps it centered where you place it on your head very well and should last much longer than a plastic band. The strap surpassed my expectations. It is easily adjustable and the flexibility feels like it was made specifically for putting something on your head, not to mention it is soft and doesn’t cause chafing at all. The earcups are essentially monolithic solid pieces. The only piece that is a worry for failure, especially from fatigue, is the connection between the earcups and the band. It is just a single piece of curved plastic and not all that thick. Its connection points between the band and earcups seem to be metal standoffs or similar (bearings and whatnot) so that should be okay (it's the general design SteelSeries has been using for a long time so I assume it works). They hopefully shouldn’t be all that load bearing but it is the only segment I would improve in the design. The volume scroll wheels feel good, not too loose not too stiff.<br/><br/>I was impressed with the comfort of these. I have glasses and have 0 issues whatsoever. In fact, I would say if you are WORRIED about the comfort with glasses with headsets I might point you towards these specifically for that itself. The cushions feel nice and are more breathable than I expected. There has been one heck of a heat wave recently so I’ve been gaming in 80+ degrees inside and haven’t experienced any sweating issues (I don’t sweat all that much in general however). The distance from the cushions to the speakers is not that deep, if you have ears that stick out farther than average you may find yourself rubbing the inside. The squeeze on the head isn’t much, I saw some reviews spitting out values but it doesn’t mean anything till you try. Playing for hours on end I haven’t had any soreness, pain, etc. from the pressure but I am extremely used to wearing headphones so it may just be me. The cushions do help though, no hotspots or pressure points. The moveability of the earcups with the help of the strap should allow basically anyone to find a comfortable position with this headset.<br/><br/>On to sound. I’m not much of an audiophile and haven’t 100% tested these to every sound degree but I can agree with some online reviews that they aren’t the best for listening to music. It seems like the mixing is very tailored to games. It doesn’t sound bad by any means but the default sound presets (flat, bass boost, smiley, focus) do not bring out anything music wise and I find myself using “flat” almost exclusively since it provides the best range imo. In-game I find no issues: they do their job, have good surround, and catch everything happening but I personally can’t find much difference between these and my old Turtle Beach XO 7 pro (rip old friend) aside from maybe very minor frequency equalization. In the SteelSeries pc download you can adjust very little to actually mix the headset yourself so it is mostly what you get at the start. The volume adjust (and speech vs in-game) provides enough to find the level you want. It had noise canceling I believe and there's no option to turn it off but I think it mitigates decently enough, I’m no longer in a louder environment so it is hard for me to tell.<br/><br/>I’d say this is a very ergonomic headset to wear: the retractable mic is a lot cooler and better than I expected, I’ve said previously you can easily get it to sit comfortably on your head, and the buttons are spread out and feel different enough to find everything quickly and easily. Connecting to both an Xbox and PC or phone are easy as heck and it is incredibly cool you can do both at once. It definitely provides an avenue to play cross-plat games with people in a discord. The microphone is clear and sounds great. The battery life is phenomenal (and one of the main reasons I chose this over the Turtle Beach Stealth 700). Right out of the box it lasted me the whole week, at least 20 hours. I have been charging it once a week since, with the charge time being fast enough to take a break, watch some shows or something, and you’re good to go.<br/><br/>Okay, everything sounds great so far but, headsets are VERY unique per person and I do have quite a few gripes. It has been said before that it takes like 6-7 seconds to turn them on and yeah, it does. No reason for it to be more than 2-3 seconds to hold that dumb power button. I’ve experienced a few instances where I turn them on, they connect, and then they turn off again within a second or two. Really weird but it has never happened in-game or anything. It may be some sequencing thing with my xbox and controller, I dunno, but it has happened more than I would like. The mic is INCREDIBLY sensitive, be wary. I never, ever, ever, have had a problem with my headsets picking up my fans before but now I do, it was so bad I almost returned them instantly. I went into the SteelSeries Engine and there is a mic volume option which I turned down to the minimum. It mitigated it enough to where I can use them and even when it does “pick” it up, I think it doesn't really register any sound now. I had to adjust my overall setup to accommodate for this and it now can pick up me just walking around due to the air moving, a bit of an issue since I like to pace. This caused me to sound fairly quiet in chat though so I had to move the mic closer to my mouth than I used to. I think it would do SteelSeries good to have a foam tip or some other method to prevent air/fan issues and general noise damping. Having the buttons and scroll wheels on the back of the earcups sounds like a good idea in principle, easy to reach, out of the way, etc. but on these they are so spread out and the scroll wheels are almost exactly where you put your hands when grabbing the headset to pick up and put down that you need to be careful not to touch them, else you have to change your volume back every single time you use them. Just a nitpick I know, I plan on getting a vertical stand for these so I don't lay the headset down on its side for this reason too. The little booklet they include is basically as minimal as you can get. The look is pretty basic, it was probably what they were going for but if the strap didn’t have the green X flair it would look like a generic solid matte black headset. I like a bit of spice, some highlights here and there ya know, nothing too much but something subtle would be nice. I’m not a super serious sound mixing studio enthusiast needing to be professional but I’m also not some RGB psycho, everyone's tastes are different.<br/><br/>All in all, this is a really good gaming headset. It’s hard NOT to recommend. I definitely endorse spending the extra money to get a headset at least in the $100+ range as the difference between a $50-70 and an $100-150 is night and day. At the end of the day, you simply have to test things like this out to see if it works for you. I truly, almost returned it due to the mic issue alone (I literally activated the return but fiddled with it until I got it usable) but after using it for a month now, I do enjoy it. There’s a lot of options out there and trying everything would take not only a lot of $$$ but a lot of time too, something not many of us have, so if I can find something that I can get to at least WORK, I am usually content</span>

<span>I like to think that when getting something with a high price tag that you're paying for both sound quality and durability. First few months with this headset was good to go and felt that I was getting my money's worth until it started rattling. The rattling would happen with some of the littlest movements and sometimes not at all. I had to spend money to buy a very specific screw driver just to get to the screws that held the speaker cover shut, remove the ear cup, unscrew to remove the plastic speaker cover to get to a chunk of plastic that snapped off and was rattling around. The plastic chunk was apparently a piece of the housing that was to help keep the metal (bracket? Bolt?) In place and to prevent from spinning around and twisting up wires. Less than three months later, another plastic chunk of the same area breaks off and now I have a loose ear cup that sits very uncomfortably on my ear that constantly needs to be readjusted and is so frustrating that I'm about ready to rip it apart.<br/><br/>In short: I love the sound quality and ability to connect to my phone via Blu tooth but the durability and cheap plastic that supposed to hold it together will prevent me from getting this ever again.</span>

<span>These headphones are great enough that I'm overlooking the few negatives I have with them to give it a full five stars. I know a lot of people probably care about sound quality the most, and that is how I started my title, but I'm going to go with comfort first. I've worn these headphones upwards of 3 hours straight on a work call and barely even knew they were on my head. The adjustment strap is a little wonky and takes some getting used to, but it keeps the bulk of the headphones off your head, and the ear cups feel like cotton balls.<br/><br/>Next, sound quality is out of this world. These sound better than my wired Sennheiser studio headphones. The mic quality, so far as I can tell, is great as well. I like being able to adjust the mic (my other headphones have a tiny mic hole built into one of the ear cups). And while I can oftentimes hear myself when I'm speaking (which is how I can tell the mic quality is en pointe), I don't hate hearing my voice like I would in other situations, like a recording of my voice.<br/><br/>I also love that I can use the headphones (with mic) using a 3.5mm aux cable because my work computer has Bluetooth disabled, which I learned after buying these.<br/><br/>Now for a shocker: I actually hate how the headphones adjust. I know, I know: I just said that helped make the headphones super comfy. Yes, that's true. But it's a springy strap with a hook-and-loop patch on one end: when the set is on my head, the strap wants to contract, making it tough to adjust. Then because I guess I have a smaller head, the two hook-and-loop patches don't meet, meaning there's a loose end of the strap that kinda flaps around. Annoying, but not a deal breaker.<br/><br/>The other con is that these headphones are frustratingly difficult to connect over Bluetooth when multiple devices are paired. Even looking at the directions, I can't figure out what to push in what order to get them to switch, and I usually take a few minutes to get them to work on the computer I want to use them with. Frustrating, but I can live with it.</span>

<span>2017 latest models and updates,  even in the gaming world 40s are the ruler<br/><br/>Tested on pc  it has accessories for Xbox PlayStation and so forth<br/><br/> We believe these are really good headset lighter than the 50s you don't have to worry about the battery the charging base and again the wait is later<br/><br/> You can plug the Astro 50 headset  into USB to charge them and continue to play (  or you can charge them on the magnetic base )  many people have found some issues with the magnetic base being a little tricky or charging the headsets useing the USB so just buy the 40s and you'll never worry about the batteries are having to charge them ever again<br/><br/>no issues direct connect with the 40s all wired,  no batteries no issues  and they are a little lighter than the 50s<br/><br/> We did a lot of reviews and research on the a40 versus the 50s  and time and time again a40 wins<br/><br/> In the gamers world over and over again they say take the 40s don't touch the 50s,  50+ reviews we stopped reading after that<br/><br/> Again I hope this helps others and we believe this is a good headset and the best out of the bunch turtle beach also has a good headset but in the long run it seems that the gamers like to daisychain and they like the mix amp and the way it's laid out so there's a lot a key features that work well with the 40s and way people choose these over the 50s<br/><br/> Another note which is very important is the generation one you cannot hold down the button for 3 to 5 seconds and change it over the PC only the latest the TR the older model says max amperage amp max on it not TR so there's been some confusion and stuff like that on the mix amps but the newest mix tr,  you can hold the button down for 3 to five seconds and it does change it over to PC  and it will go from a red color to a white color on the power switch.  There are three generations out generation 1,2 and three  three being the latest with the most latest software and it also uses the command center the command center cannot be used on the generation one mix amp<br/><br/>Note*** Generation one headset does not have magnetic ear pads ---( sorry to say the mod kit for changing the ear piece and a few other accessories many are saying it's not worth it and it changes the acoustic sound that the stock earmuffs piece is the better of them,  we have not tested it just to let you know ),  The generation three has magnetic ear pads you can take them off and replace them with the mod kits and so forth like that,  also note there is a small tags on the headsets the CTR generation one does not do that,  not sure about generation 2 sorry about that.<br/><br/> Generation one versus generation three  Cable changes  ******Generation three Toslink Male to Toslink Male Digital Optical optical to optical *****generation one has Toslink Male to Mini Toslink Male Digital Optical optical plug so the mix amps have  different connections,  yes the generation three mix amp is preferred specially the optical to optical<br/><br/> Generation one amp mix headset update is the older update you cannot use the command center on the generation one only the generation three the newest and latest headsets out  Will work with Astro's latest software that's out<br/><br/> We went ahead and bought the after market mod kit Astro a40 TR even know a lot of reviews had people talking negatives, we really like it that's our opinion we got it were using it and we like it that's all we can say it's for us we really like it<br/><br/>The mod kit has thicker pads on the ears and the head pad and they are leather, as well as the mic is upgraded it's different than the stock Miic and the  plastic outside covers  have rubber inside them versus the stock ones which do not have the rubber in them</span>

<span>I was looking forward into stepping into the headset world, and did a ton of research that led me to land on these.<br/><br/>My needs:<br/><br/>Surround - In order to get proper emulated surround, an external sound processor to decode Dolby from my XBox One is needed. The market is flooded with gaming headsets that claim they are surround, but actually just impart some phasing trickery to the stereo signal. This is not one of those systems.<br/><br/>Wired Headphones - I just don't want to stay on top of charging my headset, and don't want to worry about a battery that will fade over time. There are so many things that we have that run on batteries, I hate most of them... Also, wireless headsets do have a slight bit of latency.<br/><br/>Sound GREAT - I'm an audio professional. I sit in front of an exceptional set of speakers all day, and when I get home, I only want nice crisp sound.<br/><br/>I don't care much about style, and as long as headphones aren't painful, I'd consider them comfortable.<br/><br/>Let me say, the MixAmp with this unit is wonderful. The decoding is flawless, and having chat integrated is great. (A lot of other units will need you to run chat separately to your controller.) My one criticism is that you can not ride the controls on the MixAmp while it's connected to the XBox. You need to unplug the USB cable, and set it up on your PC or Mac. "Hey man, your chat mic is too loud!" That'l be about 5 min to set up. Turtle Beach has a lovely external dac called the TAC it has faders on the front for all the controls you need, but it's PC / Mac only. Other then that, it's great.<br/><br/>*Huge Flaw* here is the sound quality of the headset. The A40's are reviewed by many you-tubers / gear reviewers, and not one of them seems to have an ear for sound. These sound straight-up Bad. I threw them on when I got into work, without listening to anything else, and even with a blank slate ear the sound was muddy, cloudy, and outright bad. There is a lot of bass. but I think that's what people look for who don't really know much about what sounds good without reference. Then I A-B'd these against my Sony MDR-7596 ($80) that happened to be at arms reach. The difference was amazing. sweet rich highs, pronounced mids, and careful mature bottom-end. And these headphones (Sonys) are nothing special. Then switching back to the Astros, the curtain was pulled over my ears again. It felt like I had cotton balls in my ears.<br/><br/>I'm not even going to bring these home. I'm returning them, and buying the MixAmp Pro TR on it's own (because it's great) and search for a better sounding headset to pair it with.</span>

<span>After setting everything up and updating firmware, the microphone only works when the headset is connected to my phone. I've watched numerous setup videos, tried every USB port on my xbox and laptop, tons of different audio settings and searched every website and forum I could to find an answer or solution and nothing has worked. The headset itself and the mixamp seem to work perfectly fine, I just can't use any voice chat. I plugged my RIG 500's in to the mix amp and it's working with the mix amp AND I can use voice chat. Connecting my RIG cable to the A40's and mix amp, the microphone seems to work but game audio not so much. But I'm guessing that's because it's for my RIG's and not the Astros. I thought it could be the inline mute cable but it works fine when plugged in to my phone. I made a phone call and they could hear me perfectly fine. I'm pretty confused and torn on what the problem is. I've submitted a ticket with Astro but have yet to recieve any response. Made a post on the Astro Subreddit and recieved a response from Astro pretty quick with suggestions on a fix but they didn't work either and Astro has yet to respond back.<br/><br/>Pretty disappointed considering the price of it and then having this problem that must be the very first of it's kind since nobody has answer or solution. Im giving 2 stars only because the mix amp works, the headset sounds great and it's the most comfortable headset I've had. It's like pillows around my ears. So far any consumer service has been trash. For me, voice chat is just as important to have as game audio is. With most games I play, not being able to verbally communicate with other people puts me and whomever else I'm playing with, at a huge disadvantage. Plus it's just boring as hell not being able to talk to my friends and ultimately leads to them not wanting to play not just with me but not play at all because like I said it's boring and no fun being at such a big disadvantage.<br/><br/>I guess I'm gonna order a new mute cable and possibly new USB cable and see if they'll work. If so, I may change my rating to 4 stars. But even if the new cable do fix it, I won't give a better rating just because of how much of a headache its been and stress its caused me spending that much on a headset that's only 50% functional and getting next to no help from Astro, the seller or anyone else</span>

<span>After having these for around a year and a half, I decided to finally give my review of them.<br/><br/> After cycling through numerous headsets such as the Hyper X's and the Turtle Beach XO Sevens, I was looking for a headset that would last me a long time, which lead me to Astro.<br/><br/>Upon first glance I noticed that these headsets were designed to be used for competitive play. That was all fine and good to me, but I just wanted something that would be reliable, with great comfortability and sound quality. After reading numerous reviews and watching countless videos, I decided to pick these up, despite that hefty price tag.<br/><br/>Upon opening the box I knew that these guys were the real deal. The packaging was absolutely beautiful. The box that they came in was so unbelievably solid - little to no possible way that they could have gotten  damaged during shipping . Upon opening it, I was greeted with a headset that was truly remarkable. When I picked it up it just felt professional. It didn't feel like a hunk of plastic like numerous other headsets that I had owned in the past. All of the cables that I needed were packaged nicely in their own little compartment, as were the instructions.<br/><br/>Setup was a breeze - I had mine up and running in about 10 minutes or so. The optical and USB cables that are included have plenty of length to them, although I would be careful with your wire management if you play a bit further from your tv, as these two love to get tangled.<br/><br/>The comfort alone with these was worth the price tag. The ear cushions are unlike anything I had used before. They're incredibly soft, yet cancel enough noise to keep you focused on your game. I consistently forgot that I even had these things on. No ear pain, no head pain, no sweat from leather ear pieces - nothing. By far the most comfortable headset on the market - nothing even comes close.<br/><br/>Now for what really matters - the sound. Im a casual gamer. I don't compete, but I do appreciate great sound upon hearing it. That being said, Astro's mixamp is a MUST for both casual and competitive gamers. This thing works wonders. It is so unbelievably easy and convenient to use, and that's why it dominates the competition. Gone are the days of fighting with your Xbox One chat adapters to turn your game down, your chat down, etc - this gives you complete control right at your fingertips. There are multiple default EQ's that boost different things such as bass and treble, but you can even download custom EQ's for all of your favorite games online - genius. As for game sound, they perform beautiful. I was able to hear numerous things that I had never heard before. It's the smaller, more "hidden" noises that became much clearer. Stuff like people reloading, people climbing ladders, or even people switching weapons. My friends constantly asked me "How did you hear that?!" and I always proceeded to tell them about how great this thing is. Even if you don't play video games competitively, the convenience factor here is just unmatched anywhere else. You have constant control over your sound - what a concept! This thing even comes with a headphone jack installed, so you can hook up whatever device you want with an auxiliary cord and play your music, videos, movies or whatever. I personally have my gaming monitor next to my computer, so I would constantly have youtube, music or podcasts playing in the background of my games. (Yes I know Spotify is Available on Xbox One now, but I feel as though the app is a bit buggy).<br/><br/>However, after around a year and a half, my beloved mixamp decided to literally just die on me. Upon powering on my console I noticed that It didn't want to turn on for me. So I unplugged all of the cables and tried again. Nothing. I tried multiple other USB cables (The appropriate one of course) and nothing seemed to get it to power up. I was disappointed, but hey life goes on. I didn't want to come on here and rip Astro a new one for this occurrence, because the headset was so good to me throughout the time that I had it. I've come to the conclusion that technology has the tendency to indeed malfunction - and this is most certainly the case here. I will be ordering yet another mixamp from here once they arrive back in stock (Possibly never with holidays approaching quickly). I would hope that this issue only affected me, as I would never wish this to happen to anyone that drops this much money on a headset.<br/><br/>With that being said, the A40 TR's are really something special. They combine comfortability, sound quality, and user friendliness to create one monster of a headset that is sure to dominate the competition. I would recommend this to both competitive and casual gamers who are looking for high quality design and sound :)</span>

<span>The headset and the amp both have good quality material. The sound is good. Does me well in call of duty and other competitive shooters. I would look else where if you play story based games that are more cinematic.. just because there’s definitely better. Dolby sucks. Tournament mode is the way to go. The mute button is awkward. It will work if placed in a specific position when toggling the mute button.</span>

<span>Firstly, the positive, the ability to tune the sound to filter out (i.e., reduce the magnitude of) the explosions while maintaining the ability to hear footsteps most of the time is an outstanding feature for first-person shooter video games. That part worked pretty well for me. The software allows you to choose 5 center frequencies around which you want to filter. If you need more than 5 then this is not the headset for you; however, 5 has been satisfactory for me. I have to remove the unit from my PS4 and move it to my PC when I need to make an adjustment but since the software allows you to save up to 4 custom settings to the MixAmp you only have to do that when you first start using a new game and go through the trial and error process of fine-tuning the unit specifically for that game.<br/><br/>Now, a couple of negatives, the first of which is a big one. The unit does not have an ON/OFF switch. The only way to power it down is to unplug the USB power cord. That means when you want to watch a movie and want everyone in the room to enjoy it you must actually unplug the headset to allow the sound to come through your TV speakers or surround sound stereo system. Alternatively, you can go into your PlayStation console settings and force the sound to go through the PC but honestly, it's a bit of a pain to have to do that every single time.<br/><br/>Secondly, the voice/game mix knob does NOT work as needed. In my older generation A40/MixAmp Pro it works perfectly such that when you turn the knob fully over to game you can no longer hear voice chat, and when you turn the know fully over to voice you can no longer hear the game but can still talk to your friends via game chat. On this new unit the knob causes the game to get extremely loud in both directions and only provides useful balancing between approximately the 11:30 o'clock and 12:30 o'clock positions on the dial. So, if you only need to make a slight balance adjustment it may work for you, but sadly, it doesn't work that well for me. If Astro's technical support indicates that my unit is defective and is able to solve the problem I will update this review afterward.</span>

<span>NOTE: I had trouble setting up the A40s to my PC. I could not separate the game and voice audio through the mixamp (using the game/voice chat dial on the right only changed the volume of both at the same time, making it useless and forcing me to adjust voice volume on Discord separately). ASTRO's YouTube tutorial only made it more confusing, as it told me to change Playback sound to ASTRO Game Audio and Recording to ASTRO Voice Audio. This had game and voice go through the USB line, so they couldn't be adjusted separately in the mixamp. You have to connected the provided digital optical (or an AUX) cable from the mixamp to your PC and set Playback accordingly (I used a digital optical cable and had to change playback to Digital Audio). Now that game and voice are going through two separate lines into the mixamp, they can be adjusted separately.<br/><br/>There's no denying ASTRO is one of the most popular and widely used gaming headsets on the market. I bought this to use on my PC and maybe my PS4 if I felt like hooking it up there. Although sound (especially surround sound) quality is suburb, the software to configure the headset leaves a lot to be desired. The Windows app they recommend downloading for this headset doesn't recognize it, making the program useless. If you download the driver from ASTRO's website, even though it's older, it will detect the headset and you can make new audio profiles to store in the mixamp. Although simple, it's effective. I also had a huge problem setting up the correct audio lines to get the mixamp to work properly (see above) but eventually got it working.<br/><br/>Also, get the Mod Kit. Even though the ear cushions are comfortable, the faux leather ones in the mod kit are superior. Which will put your purchase above $300 if buying everything new. Kind of wish that this were included with the high price tag of the base model.</span>

<span>This is my third refurbished Astro headset, A50 Gen 1&gt;A50 Gen 2&gt;A40 2019. The A50s were great aside from occasional desync-ing and low battery life. These are otherwise my goto headset for years. I could never justify the $250-300 price new but Astro's refurbished headsets are nearly brand new for around half the original price. The A40 provides a superior soundstage to the A50 and doesn't need to be charged, the cables are long enough that having a wired headset isn't too much of an issue . The Mixamp TR steals the show and gives granular control over the 5 EQ presets. It would imo be worth it just for the Mixamp itself through which you can download or tweak up to 5 custom EQs from Astro Command Center.<br/>Only catch was that the item appeared to be an open box return and the supplied micro USB that powers the mixamp had a damaged connector and wouldn't even slide into the USB port- easily remedied with a replacement USB cable.<br/><br/>Would be 5 stars if the item arrived fully functional but replacing the USB cable was not a deal breaker. This was otherwise a new unit in original box and with original documentation.</span>

<span>First off, this headset is really nice. Confortable ear pads, nice mic (I added a pop cover to combat the breathing sound because the mic is really sensitive).<br/><br/>Pros: you can swap the mic to either side, Comfortable ear pads, nice cables, good mic and audio quality. The amp is nice and is ready easy to mix the audio.<br/><br/>Cons: If you have a head any bigger than a size 7 1/2 this thing is probably going to be to small. My head is small to average size and its barely big enough for my head when the headset is extended all the way. Another thing that I don't like is that the audio jack on the headset is towards the back of the left side and hits my shoulder when I lean back or turn my head to the left. While the amp is really nice, if I am in a chat I have to mix audio as far to the chat side as possible or it's not loud enough. Also the amp could stand to have a replaceable cable.<br/><br/>In all its a good headset. If its on sale, buy it. Otherwise Its not really worth the price. You might as well just get some turtle beaches for half the price.</span>

<span>UPDATED BELOW*<br/><br/>VERY disappointed in these. When I got them,  was super impressed in the packaging, the box, the headset itself, looking so well designed. They are very comfortable and look great. But... do you buy a headset for the way they look or the way they sound? There is the issues. Yes, issues, plural. First off, they are stereo. Ok, I've used stereo ones in the past. The quality just wasn't there for me, especially being the almighty ASTRO GAMING! Seems like more hype happening... three EQ modes. First one is so flat, fine MAYBE for dialogue only. Second one is MEH (meaning not great) for mid range evidentally, and last should be bass, but I wouldn't call it that for sure. Muddy is what I'd call it. The thing plugs into the bottom of the controller like the old school puck and you can balance chat and game audio. Ok, but the mute button for the mic is situated on the bottom so if you game like me sometimes lying down with controller resting on stomach, etc, you'll inevitably be hitting mute/ unmute all the time. Another issue I notice is just wiggling the connection to the headset from the 3.5 with cause that one of a kind crackle like there's a bad connection. I found audio to cut out in game sometimes. So for me, I'm playing Destiny, and there's a lot of enemies around me, so there's different roars and yells and gun shots, etc, and its like the headset couldn't handle the complexity of it. Very very disappointing to say the least since its ASTRO and also looking back at the price tag for these. Last issue I can think of right now is the connection to the puck is a thin flag plug going in it at an angle on the bottom of the controller so I'd expect after a while of wear and tear for that thing to lose connection. In short, don't go for these. Go with Turtle Beach. I've had very good success with them. My first set was TB's and I've had MANY sets since then.<br/><br/>UPDATE 9/26/16: Ok... so after using them a little bit, I might have been a little bit harsh. The 3rd eq actually isn't too bad.Decent boost. But there's still problems with the audio cutting out when several things are happening in game sometimes, not all the time. After using them these few days, I have to say the are the most comfortable headphones I have ever used. I have gone through MANY headphones in my time. These things fit, my head anyway, like a glove. The breathable velour, I think it is, is so soft. I WOULD recommend these headphones and I'll use this small instance for future reference on giving things second tries. Peace people.</span>

<span>First off let me just say, some of the issues I had are my own fault in terms of lack of research. The other issues are of the actual headphones.<br/><br/>PROS<br/>- sound quality is decent. Not incredible but above average compared to similar models from other manufactures.<br/>- comfort<br/>- ease of use. The ability to plug them in and have them fire up automatically is fantastic.<br/>- The mic is flawless. Great sound quality and friends were able to hear me perfectly. My old pair of Tritton AX Pros had me yelling into the mic all the time.<br/>- the M80 amp is not bad (see the cons). The ability to adjust all the settings without even looking down at the controller was great.<br/><br/>CONS<br/>- The M80 amp. The amount of crackle and pop that it produced was inexcusable. I tried it on 3 controllers and still got the same results. The pop was so bad it would hit my ears like a jack hammer, causing you to rip off the headset and wait for it to stop.<br/><br/>- Lack of 7.1 surround. This is my fault. I should have done the research and not assumed Astros staple product line, the A40 would have at least had 5.1 or 7.1 surround. If you want to convert them to 7.1 be ready to spend $130 on the mix amp. You'll be north of $330 when you're said and done. Also throw in another $25 for the Xbox adapter since the M80 is worthless.<br/>- The 3 preset audio modes. I couldn't find a happy medium between "Pro" and "Astro". One was more sharp but not a lot of bass. The other was dull and moderate bass. For them not being a "powered" speaker I guess that is to be expected.<br/><br/>Case In point. I returned them after a solid week of use. They aren't bad if you don't care about the immersion 7.1 surround brings and the crackle and pop. I bought the A50s instead. The sound quality (different drivers than the A40), the 7.1 surround, the mic (while not detachable, who cares) quality is great, is a much better deal.</span>

<span>4 stars is a fair rating for these headsets. They are premium priced, and I like the style a lot more than the Microsoft version, but not as much as the Skullcandy SLYR. These headsets fit a larger head, and the simplified mixamp really should set a standard for headphones on the XBox One.<br/><br/>As far as 7.1 on the console, I've owned a few, and wouldn't recommend. I wouldn't recommend wireless as well. These are the best plug into the controller stereo headsets I've tried. I've owned (own) a lot.<br/><br/>The biggest con I've found is that the headphone earpiece material seems to be a polyester fill. I may be wrong, but it feels like it to me, as the SLYR's felt a lot like memory foam. For two hundred dollars, I would have thought that they would have used a more premium earmuff material. I think the standard should be memory foam with a gel topping to keep your ears cool like premium memory foam mattresses do.<br/><br/>Overall, these are stylish, comfortable, and really are great for isolating sounds. I'd guess that the drivers are 50mm, but don't quote me on that. I'd recommend these, but wait until they go on sale, unless you have money to drop. As I've stated in my Skullcandy review, the Microsoft XBox One headphones are sufficient, but the isolation on these, as well as the Skullcandy SLYR's take gaming to the next level.</span>

<span>The headset was doing good until about 3 months in i started to notice that the audio was cutting out. Now every now and then the audio starts to cut out for bits of time and i can’t hear or use the mic which is extremely irritating especially when you’re in the middle of an intense match</span>

<span>I got these as a replacement for a pair that didnt work in one cup, these work great and have no damage. The audio is pretty simple to control and it sounds great. The mic is a tad bit sensitive and picks up my fan across the room and the charge station is just a bit finicky to get charging but its great over all.</span>

<span>Been nothing but issues having this headset. I didn’t even know a headset could have so many issues till now.. WOW!<br/>When they work 30% of the time it’s great!!<br/>When they don’t work 70% of the time, it’s absolutely ridiculous. Expensive ass headset but has more issues than a $5 headset.<br/>Id recommend not buying these</span>
