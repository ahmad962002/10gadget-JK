<p> </p><ul>
<li><span class="a-list-item"> COMFORTABLE &amp; SNUG FIT IN KIDS/WOMEN SMALL EARS - These over ear earbuds are lightweight. Ergonomically-shaped ear buds nestle comfortably in ears and get a secure hold. You don't have to jam the in ear part into ear canal as typical in ear headphones. They are smaller than normal earbuds. All these make them suitable for people who can't keep regular earbuds in or have small ears (like petite women, boys, girls and age 8+ school kids).  </span></li>
<li><span class="a-list-item"> SPORT EARBUDS THAT STAY IN EARS ON THE MOVE - Wrap around ear design keeps earbuds from slipping out while working out. The flexible earhook wire is soft and thin. You can hardly feel them even with glasses over ear. The ear hook also helps keep ear buds around ears from missing when not in use. There's a clip to keep cable from moving around.  </span></li>
<li><span class="a-list-item"> DECENT SOUND &amp; NOISE ISOLATING - The sound of these sport earbuds is loud and clear. Has strong bass that drives you in sports and no distortion under high volume. Work well for music, audio books, podcast and radio. The Angled in-ear design helps block out background noise. These running earbuds still offer extra memory foam tips to achieve much better sound quality and noise isolating performance.  </span></li>
<li><span class="a-list-item"> EASY HANDS-FREE TRACKS, VOLUME CONTROL &amp; CLEAR SOUND ON PHONE CALL - The in-line mic sits just below the jaw, picks up your voice while isolating background noise, which ensures clear phone call conversations. With the remote buttons, you can easily answer/end calls, pause/play/skip tracks, activeate voice (siri) command, control volume during running.  </span></li>
<li><span class="a-list-item"> SWEATPROOF EARBUDS WITH DURABLE CORD - These sport headphones are sweat proof and the cord is thicker than typical earbud headphones, which is more durable for intense sweaty exercise. The gold plated plug is compatible with iPhone SE/ 6/6s/6 Plus/6s Plus/5/5c/5s (ligtning adapter needed for iphone 7 and above version), iPad, iPod touch, Macbook, tablets, MP3, Laptop, computer, Chromebook, Kindle fire, Android/Windows cell phones (might need type C adatper) and other 3.5mm audio devices.  </span></li>

</ul>

ENJOY HIGH QUALITY SOUND WITHOUT ANNOYING EXTERNAL NOISES There're 4 different sizes silicone ear plugs to offer comfortable, sung seal for different ears. The bonus memory foam eartips will hugely enhance the comfort, bass and noise isolation. It's passive noise reduction, so won't block out noise completely. But if insert ear buds properly in ears with right tips and music on, external sound like airplane noise, talkings at the gym/subway/work, will be reduced up to 90%.

You can hear the other person clearly without complaint of others not able to hear you, even at a noisy gym. 52in/131cm CORD LENGTH Ears won't be tugged while phones or ipod in your pocket/armband with earphones pluugged in. You can manage cable length with the shirt clip, so the wire will stay out of the way and not moving around when running.

<span class="cr-original-review-content">Lo que me agrado era que son muy cómodos al usarlos para oír música o ver una serie. Otra cosa que me gustó era que son muy pero muy resistentes a los tirones, esto lo comprobé cuando se me cayó mi pixel 5a de mi pantalón, mi celular quedó colgando de los audífonos y pudo evitar que se me rompiera. Cuando esto ocurrió me quedé con cara, de gracias dios, gracias por haber evitado que mi celular muriera al caer al suelo. Otra cosa que me gustaron es que son cómodos de usar cuando estás tratando de escuchar musica y echarte una siesta en el carro o en la cama. Algo que no me gusta de los Audífonos es que no tiene punta magnética de esas que usas para ponerte los audífonos en el cuello cuando no estás usando los.<br/>A hora nueva mente entrando en el terreno de la dureza de los audífonos es que son muy resistentes y no lo digo por la resistencia a los tirones sino que también pudo resistir a ser lavados en la lavadora, aunque perdieron un poco de volumen y se empezó a oír robótico el sonido, pero todavía sigue, Siendo útiles. Un problema que me tope fue cuando empezaron a fallar por culpa de Daño al audio jack la parte donde le metes el cable a tu celular. Estos empezaron a fallarme del lado izquierdo, empezó con un poco de estática. Pero no perdió utilidad. Pasando un par de semanas se me Daño a un más el audio jack y perdí el sonido del lado izquierdo, pero volvía cuando le movía al cable por el audio jack. Hasta que finalmente llegó lo que me temía y era que empezó a fallarme el lazo derecho también, pero como en el lado izquierdo, esto se solucionaba con moviendo el audio jack. Nunca llegue a usar el controlador de volumen, asi que no se si sirve de algo.<br/>En conclusión te los recomiendo por el precio y por la calidad.</span><span class="cr-translated-review-content aok-hidden"></span>

<span>I’m not a fan of big headsets. I don’t like how much heat they trap in around my ears, and how the middle top part presses down on my hair. These work perfectly on Xbox, and the comfort and quality are absolutely on point, especially for the price! I ordered a pair for my fiancé in pink, she also loves them. The only thing it doesn’t have is a mute switch for the mic. Other than that, I will 100% repurchase these again in the future.</span>

<span>I purchased these to replace my Beats wired ear buds and to pair with my Kindle. I could not be more pleased! The sound quality and noise cancelling features as well as the comfort simply can not be beat at this price point.<br/>My 20 something year old son and daughter really liked them as well. We agreed that we almost prefer these over our wireless earbuds. I've worn them up to 6 consecutive hours with no discomfort. I have already ordered 4 more pair to be stocking stuffers as well as one for my husband who works from home and needs the microphone feature. I will say again I could not be happier.</span>

<span>The earbuds are fine. The reason I chose them was for the additional case. It’s a plastic hard case with a hole in the middle because it is a donut. I was under the impression that the earbuds could be placed in it to put them away properly. That is basically impossible. It’s not a pouch to put them in quickly. That would have been great for safe keeping in the backpack. Oh well. For just the earbuds they were too expensive.</span>

<span>I thought the "breathing" feature of the panda earbuds would be cute. The flashing "breathing" is not just for indicating in use or charging modes.  It's pretty much a constant flash and it was still going for up to an hour after I docked the buds. The case is not easy for me to open. I dropped the panda more times than I could count. Each and everytime I tried to use and redock the buds it needed someone stronger than me to ooen the magnetic hinge. Some of the strongest closure magnets I've ever encountered for sure. I use ear buds as part of my nightly routine. The breathing feature is bright and effects my sleep. The child size a as selling point is inaccurate. Middle aged female ears and the buds were still too large to fit even with the smaller rubber sized ear tip protector in. Dissapointed in all of it. Cute design but not practical or usable for me</span>

<span> I am in love with these! This is the third pair of earbuds I've purchased in two months (not the same ones) and I finally found ones that fit my ears. Even though it says kids on it, these still have a set of rubber ear pieces that are a little bigger in size just in case they are to small. How cool is that!?! The eyes light up while charging and the eyes will blink when the battery is low. I am so very pleased with the outcome. Thank you SOOOO much. The sound is phenomenal and noises cannot be heard once both buds are in. Thanks for the awesome earbuds!</span>

These earbuds work very well for my needs, which are streaming video and listening to music. The sound quality is good and the earbuds are comfortable.These earbuds are made using quality materials and are very durable. It's great that they come in a 5 pack of different colors so I can share them with my family. It is also nice to have a spare set on hand just in case.You really can’t beat this deal! I have two kiddos that need earbuds for e-learning and one of them goes through earbuds pretty quickly or loses them. With 5 pairs, we have been able to keep one in his book bag, one at home at his desk for e-learning days, one for sister for her e-learning days, and still have 2 pairs left over just in case! I like that there were 5 colors available (2 of them were black) so it’s easy to figure out which set belonged to which child.

<span>I bought these for my nearly 11 year old daughter to use and I was about to write a glowing review on how much she liked them, how well they worked, and how easy they are to use.  But just the other week, less than 2 months of ownership, my daughter comes to me and says one of the ear buds isn't working (left one).<br/><br/>I troubleshot and determined that its battery is dead and needed to be charged.  But every time I put it in the case to charge it will not charge.  I checked the contacts on both the case and earbud and they are clean and not damaged.  The ones on the case have a bit of springy action to them to that appears to be fine as well, functioning the same as the right side. Yet, if I place the earbud into the case and apply light pressure to it, it will start charging.  Let off and it will stop.  The contacts appear to touch and there is nothing keeping the earbud from inserting completely into the case.  Maybe the springy contacts in the case need to be pushed down more to activate?<br/><br/>So as a temporary work around, I folded up a small piece of paper to put on top of the earbud and closed the case.  This appears to work in applying just enough pressure to allow it to charge, but I shouldn't have to do this.<br/><br/>I am past the return period to request an exchange or refund by only a few weeks, so I must now go through warranty claims.  Fun...and so shortly after purchasing them.<br/><br/>While they are still under warranty and one of the two earbuds is still working without issue, I didn't buy them for only one earbud to work.  I am giving it 1-star out of pure concern over how quickly they started to act up after purchase.  There are certainly more expensive, higher quality options to choose from.  But I have also purchased cheaper ear buds in the past that lasted longer.<br/><br/>Unless Belkin or Amazon are able to rectify the issue quickly and painlessly, this rating will stay the same.</span>

<span>As headphones, these are great. Long battery. Comfortable (and though they’re made for kids, they fit in my teen’s ears just fine). Good sound quality. My teen isn’t super fond of the touch controls, but he prefers real buttons in general, so I suspect a lot of users will be fine with the touch controls.<br/><br/>Our only big complaint? He called me on these, and the audio was pretty awful. I am NOT a fan of the microphone at all.<br/><br/>3.5 stars.</span>

<span>First of all I love that they came with a warranty, so I'll start with that positive! They have extra buds so you can change them for your little one; and we had to. My daughter used the next size down from the ones that were originally on and they fit perfect! Like the holding case and the sound is better than I anticipated. The reason for 3 stars is because the sound is great for my teen and us, yes... but way too loud for my 7 year old. When she starts talking loud I know the volume is too loud and I have to make her turn it down. I'm gonna keep them because she barely uses them.

<span>As an adult, I have small ear canals. Every pair of earbuds I have purchased, no matter how soft, the ear tips start hurting my ears, even with the smallest tips available. After tons of research, I decided to try kids earbuds. I'm so glad I found these! I still had to put the smallest tips in, but they fit great and after wearing for a couple hours, still no pain. YAY! Also, you are able to use only one earbud a time, if needed. HUGE PLUS for me. On other earbuds both had to be out of the case in order to function, so glad I have the option without function loss. Here's some info on these: THE CASE: The eyes light up and there are (4) dots on the front that show you how much charge is left in the case - not the buds (25/50/75/100%).  Not to mention how cute/cool the case is. WEIGHT: Probably because these are for kids, but they are super light and not bulky at all - not only do I have small ear canals, but I have small ears too. SOUND: Surprisingly great bass and clear sound quality. I was pretty impressed with the bass. Music is clear and the bass is great without overpowering. BATTERY LIFE: These buds last exactly 4 hours of continuous movie/music play - on a full charge. DISCLAIMER: I only use this to connect to my iPad Air 4 for movies &amp; music. I don't use it for talking to anyone, so I can't comment on how well it is for phone/conference calls. TIP: Make sure you glance at the booklet so you know how many taps on which earbud to adjust the volume, answer your calls, etc..</span>
