<span>I have had several pairs of similar type devices used exclusively for using SmartPhone, primarily to make and take cellphone calls.  The BEST featured was the LG30 model; problem is that after awhile the device will no longer take a charge due to wearing of the charge port.  The newer HBS-SL5 model works satisfactorily and is comfortable to wear, but battery life is short and the 'vibration' level for incoming calls is low.  Another shortfall is in software that does NOT advise when the device is connected or even on/off as did the LG30's.  The retractable earpiece(s) are nice and work well, but seem a bit flimsy.</span>

<span>I feel the sound quality could have been so much better. The battery lasts a 10 hour shift so it's very good. Some noise cancellation but I work in a very noisy place.</span>

<blockquote><em><div class="a-row a-spacing-small review-data"><span class="a-size-base review-text review-text-content" data-hook="review-body">
<span>I got these earbuds to use with all the Zooms in my life--work meetings, teaching, book clubs, HOA meetings, everything!<br/><br/>I like classical music, and was using my B&amp;W headphones and a wireless mic.  The B&amp;Ws have great sound, which is why they cost $400, but the whole setup is bulky.  My wife said I looked like a nerd with the mic and 'phones.<br/><br/>I bought the most expensive Samsung earbuds, and they wouldn't stay in, so I went back to looking like a nerd.  I think the biggest problem was that the only other person in the book club who wears 'phones is a real nerd, so this put me right in there with him, in my wife's eyes.<br/><br/>Then I saw these.  I have a lot of respect for LG.  We have an 83" TV from them that's spectacular, as well as a couple of smaller sets.  And my computer is an LG Gram, that's fast as blazes, has a huge screen, and weighs just 3 pounds, so carrying it around won't wear me out when I travel.  When I'm working at home it drives 4 displays without a problem.<br/><br/>The earbuds arrived yesterday.  I charged them, and I'm using them now.  They connected to Bluetooth right away  I put them into my ears--they are smaller than the Samsung earbuds.  Apparently the neck piece allows LG to move some electronics out of the earbuds.  They fit really well and are comfortable.  I also know that even if they do fall out, the cords on them will prevent them from going far.  No problem with losing a small, expensive device.<br/><br/>But the best part is the sound.  I'm listening to violin sonatas right now, and the sound is wonderful.  Is it 100% as good as the B&amp;W 'phones?  No.  But is it good enough for listening to classical music for a few hours while I work?  Yes, it is.  In fact, I have to call the sound very good.  I'm enjoying it.<br/><br/>I think the folks at LG have made yet another great product!</span>

<span>I don't like the full time in the ear buds.  I like this hangs on my neck, I don't need a case to store them in to charge.<br/>Average talk time for me is 3 to 4 days.<br/>My one ask for these would be to tell me what the battery level is when I first turn them on.</span>

<span>Edit: I am now 1 month in and I am adding 1 more star enthusiastically. It's not for audiophiles (try 1more of fiio Neckband) but has  the best and fastest assistant integration of any headset.  If it had better codec and battery I would give it 5, but it has multi-point.<br/><br/>End editing:<br/><br/>This is a cool device, but hard to recommend for most people due to price and competition. At $145 it is $110 more than anker life u2, which is competitive with sound and has twice the battery life. For audio fans, 1more dual anc has dual drivers, anc, and twice the battery.<br/><br/>That said, there is a use case. This has the best Google Assistant integration from any device outside of pixel buds. It can read notifications and work independently of your phone. Most ear buds just prompt your phones assistant This does a lot more and is as fast as my pixel phone..<br/><br/>The sound is good, but only a little better than Anker. No aptx. It has 32 bit upscaling but that might be marketing jargon.<br/><br/>The app has good assistant options but only 3 eq presets.<br/><br/>Battery is listed 7-8 hours.  You get closer to 5. I have tws that last way more than that without a single charge up. And anker, one plus bullets z, and 1more bands are all have much longer life. You can sleep in the anker or bullets, go a 2nd day.<br/><br/>The sound is above average. Better than the anker neckband (at $40 the anker neckband does not have app functionality)<br/><br/>So, if you use notifications, love Google Assistant, and can afford a luxury, sure. It has multi-point. Fast charging too with usbc. There are limited neckbands with usbc. This is an amazing utility. But I feel like it's worth listing at $99, not $145.<br/><br/>But your paying a lot of money and sacrificing on other features lot. For 90 percent of shoppers I would suggest trying the anker life u2 at $40. Or oneplus bullets z.<br/><br/>If you want wireless with better quality try 1more, sony or go analog.</span>

<span>I use to have the ear buds. I also had a problem. Then my son recommended these. He does very extensive research and bought a pair for himself. That was a no Brainerd for me. Now, I too own a these. So far so good. I love how the cord can stretch out and I can use comfortably in bed with just one ear attached. I fell asleep with them on last night 🌙</span>

<span>The quality is good both for the microphone and also for the earphones.  It is the most convenient set of earphones for me.  The collar fits neatly under a men’s shirt and the ear pieces retract so that they don’t dangle.  However, it is not water resistant so I do not recommend it for use while exercising.</span>

<span>I bought product in July 2022. Like the sound and the size and ease of use. Buttons are big.  Do not like the way it fits around my neck. Personal preference is a thinner neck wrap. A little disappointed that in less than 3 months the covering where the on/off switch has lifted from the headset mold.</span>

<span>Bought these to replace a broken, much older model LG retractable earbud set.  The LG Tone NP3 is a great headset for the price.  I use it all day, everyday with my iPad and iPhone.  The battery life is what initially attracted me to this particular model.  While I agree with what others have said in regards to the volume being a little limiting, it’s not that big of a deal and would not deter me from buying a second pair.</span>

<span>The sound quality is great, this is super comfortable, and the battery lasts for two days. I use this to go to work. I use it all day to listen to music while I work, and on the way back home. I never have any issues with these headphones and everyone tells me that they can hear me over the phone. Sometimes they could hear background noises which is the only con about this headset but it still works great.</span>

<span>I have owned almost every LG neckband headset including LG Tone Ultra SE, LG Tone Platinum, and LG Tone Studio. I have bought many different brands of neckband headsets and I keep coming back to LG even though they rarely last more than a year. To be fair I do wear them 24/7. I fall asleep listening to my phone and then use them as earplugs when I'm sleeping. With my experience I can say that these live up to the previous models I've owned. They are one of the best looking models and the sound quality is on par with JBL and Harman Kardon versions. You have to make some adjustments to get them to sound good. First, the earbuds run small and you will need to go larger than you usually do. I usually use the regular size but with these I had to go with the largest ones. You can change the audio EQ settings by holding the fwd and reverse buttons at the same time while listening to something. I use the Bass Boost EQ setting to get fuller sound. These Meridian tuned speakers hit deep bass and are a little more punchy too. You also may need to break in the speakers. I ran mine at full volume for a few hours and the bass was much better after.<br/><br/>Pros:<br/>Stylish<br/>Light weight<br/>External speaker that reads texts<br/>Great sound<br/>Quick charging<br/><br/>Cons:<br/>Controls are a little hard to get used to<br/>Battery life is 8 hours<br/>They sometimes forget the default EQ setting<br/>They don't turn off automatically when they lose connection<br/>Sometimes the external speaker is not very loud<br/><br/>I will be keeping these and hoping they last more than a year this time.</span>

<blockquote><em><div class="a-row a-spacing-small review-data"><span class="a-size-base review-text review-text-content" data-hook="review-body">
<span>I'll start off by saying I've had this since mid-December. After years of using the HBS-700 and hearing of the problems of the 730 I figured I'd wait until the next model came out, so when I heard the 800 had been released I went for it despite the huge price increase.<br/><br/>BLUETOOTH CONNECTIVITY: 0/5<br/><br/>The bread and butter of any bluetooth headset. My hope was that the bugs that were present in the 730 would have been ironed out in the 800. Sad to say I've been fairly disappointed. All the connectivity issues that I could have imagined and more are still present in the 800. I can go from sitting with my phone in my pocket and seemingly getting a stable connection, to standing up and walking around and the connection will grow unstable for several seconds and the sound will stutter. It's like they tried to do something clever and get the device to auto range it's Bluetooth signal to save battery power, except that when it has to adjust its signal power it's not a smooth transition and stuff just ends up garbled for several seconds. What irks me more though is that, albeit a rare occurrence, there have been a handful of times where the headset just stops outputting sound altogether and/or loses connection. Even if you're not moving and your phone is 2 ft. away from your head. The most recent instance of this is what compelled me to make this review. It's very annoying to compare the Bluetooth signal of the most recent model and have to say that it's outright inferior to that of the first model. I'd sooner opt for less battery life.<br/><br/>SOUND: 5/5<br/><br/>Probably the only area that surpasses the 700 model. The sound is great for this type of headset. It's clear and doesn't sound like it's being compressed. You can definitely tell that the 700 has a flatter sound by comparison. While I can't vouch for the sound clarity in comparison to the 730, it's definitely this items one saving grace.<br/><br/>ANC: 1/5<br/><br/>An interesting choice of addition to the headset, but it's nowhere near strong enough to be of any real use in noisy environments. Based on my usage of it, I'd say it'd be more accurate to judge it based on its ability to make quiet environments even quieter, which can be nice... But not an extra 70 bucks worth of nice. All in all this is more of an extra feature, and it's really not all that useful. It's worth noting as a side note though that the switch for ANC is separate from the rest of the button activated options that this device typically has. This means you can even turn ANC on(and keep it on) even when the device itself is turned off. Be careful, since this feature does drain battery life, if you accidentally forget to shut off ANC you'll probably end up regretting it if you still want to use the device later.<br/><br/>PHONE CALLS: 5/5<br/><br/>I don't typically make use of this device for calls, but I will say that the sound still comes out clear and the mic is good enough to not muffle everything you say.<br/><br/>BATTERY LIFE: 3/5<br/><br/>I turn it on at 5:30 in the morning, use it all throughout the day, and it's typically drained by 3:30. 10 hours of use when solely listening to music. Turn on ANC and have it on all day and you can cut 2 hours out of your battery life, so you're usually better off leaving ANC off. I don't have an estimate for making phone calls other than the battery seems to drain much faster when you're using it, so use it sparingly if you don't have access to a charger. The battery life is on par with what my 700 model was when it was still new. However, based on my observations of my family members 730 model, they can go about 11-12 hours based on music alone.<br/><br/>DESIGN CHANGES: 4/5<br/><br/>These took a bit of getting used to, but all in all I'd say it's a positive change. The LED's now off to the inside and doesn't stand out as much when you're wearing it. I've grown to like the new placement of the Vol. and the Fwd/Prev. buttons, as well as the sleeker look of the phone and play/pause buttons. I also like that the two small pieces holding the wire's to the earbuds are now thicker since the two small plastic pieces to hold the earbud wires eventually broke off my old 700 model. I will say I don't care for the lighter weight of the device. It feels kind of flimsy now and I'm wary of the possibility of it falling off and hitting the corner of a hard surface in the wrong way. Worthwhile changes were made overall I'd say, but part of me would actually prefer the LED's to be dimmer and less noticeable still.<br/><br/>PRICE POINT: 0/5<br/><br/>I'd like to say the price is a bad joke. At most I could see the overall usefulness of this being maybe $5-10 more than the 730, not twice the price and then some. Not for a device that I feel falls short of expectations along with needless additions. All in all, I'm not sure what the development team was thinking.<br/><br/>I mean come on, for a whopping $130 price tag($70-80 increase over previous models) I'd demand no less than absolute perfection in whatever concept they're striving for. As in iron out the darn bugs and THEN expand on adding extra features like ANC. For this kind of price tag, what I was expecting was that at least the 3 core essentials of this product would've blown the 700 out of the water and at least put the 730 out of its misery. To specify, I was hoping the sound would've been better than even the 730, Bluetooth capability would've been as good if not better than the 700, and then battery life would've been a solid 12 hours minimum. None of that was achieved.<br/><br/>CONCLUSION: 2/5<br/><br/>The design changes and the sound enhancements are great. No doubt about that. However, ANC is a gimmick as far as I'm concerned, and the Bluetooth is a joke in comparison to the 700, and with battery life on par with if not just short of the 700 model I can't help but be disappointed. So to top it off with a $130 price tag is like a kick in the teeth. So I've been left utterly disappointed and couldn't possibly recommend this product to anyone else.<br/><br/>Now I'm a fairly patient person, an annoying hiccup here and there hasn't made me give up on this headset, but I wouldn't be honest if I didn't say that I regret putting down $130 on this. Normally despite my gripes I'd say that this headset still deserves 3 stars, however for failing to put out a thoroughly tested and upgraded product, for charging through the nose for it, and for all around just feeling like they took what could've been a great product series and butchering it, the most I can give is 2 stars.<br/><br/>I hope that LG's development team for this product reads the reviews here and refocuses it's efforts on better improving the quality of the core aspects of the headsets bluetooth capability, sound, and its battery life before they focus on adding extra features and gimmicks.</span>

<span>I bought these to replace a 2 yr old set of HBS-730's. I was pretty happy with the older HBS-730, and debated just buying another pair; specially as the older 730 is now half the original cost. I opted to spend about double, or what the 730 originally cost, on the newer HBS-800. The old 730 has a design flaw for the ear bud wires, which come out of the headsets perpendicular, placing a lot of stress on the wires. After 2 years the wires did break. The newer 800 has the wires come out parallel, which hopefully will have less stress. Additionally I felt that the 80 had several interesting extra features to justify the extra cost, such as: Google Voice Actions, Ambient Noise Cancellation, JBL audio, and relocated controls.<br/><br/>The wire locations do appear to be a much better design. However, that is about the only thing that really seems to a justification for the upgrade. There are no instructions on how to use the Google Voice Actions, or what phones are compatible. So I have yet to use this feature. I have a pair of Audio Technica headphones with Noise Cancellation that work amazing, but I have yet to find an environment where the Noise Cancellation makes a difference with the 800's. I knew that the JBL was probably a gimmick, and it appears to be so. I can't tell any difference in sound, compared to the older 730. The relocated buttons do help cut down on accidental hits from my chin or neck, specially when laying down. However, the side buttons are much harder to operate, specially the power button. The dial and start/stop buttons or still on the top, but might be slightly lower. So still not sure if 'chin dials' will be eliminated. Really wish the last number redial could be disabled, I never need this.<br/><br/>I also was surprised to find that the magnets on the 800 are noticeably weaker, and harder to align than the older 730. The manual also documents a EQ mode, which is just a Bass Boost, that I wasn't aware of before purchasing. This sounded good, since bass is always an issue with small ear pieces. However, the difference between On/Off with the Bass Boost is barely noticeable. I tested this across a variety of bass heavy music, and actually think the boosted mode is most like the default on the old 730.<br/><br/>Overall I am unsure if the HBS-800 was worth the extra cost, compared to just replacing the older HBS-730. I could have bought 2 sets of the 730's. The sound quality between the two versions are about identical, which is really the critical requirement. The new wire layout should help them last longer, and does keep the wires closer to the head, rather than sticking out as much. The other advertised upgrades don't really offer much.<br/><br/>Update: Down from 4 stars to 3 stars, as ultimately the HBS-800 only lasted 1 year before they failed internally, and are dead. No idea what happened. They were replaced with a much cheaper set of Motorola Buds, which really weren't that much different. The Buds have recently been replaced with Samsung Level U Pro's, which are amazing at this price point! Cheaper than any of the LGs.</span>

<span>I absolutely love these headphones.<br/><br/>This is my first set of this style so I can't compare them to other sorts of headsets as far as feature comparison or a better/worse performance. I came off of the earbuds that come with a Galaxy S6 for the sake of this review.<br/><br/>Build quality : Sufficient. They are a bit floppy and I worry about the earbud cables eventually getting weakened. They have a stress relief little cable guide but when you are using it, it's pretty easy to restrict cable length such that you can't fit them into your ears. The magnets are a good addition but they're too weak to really be of much value. The earbuds inevitably just fall out of the little sockets.<br/><br/>Battery life : Great. I can get two days of usage depending on how much music I used them for and if the noise cancelling was on the entire time. The charging system is kind of lame: it uses a micro-USB connection but it's recessed in such a way that you NEED to use their charging cable to get a good solid connection.<br/><br/>Comfort : I typically have these on with collared shirts. I wear them all day and often more. They're definitely comfortable around the neck especially with a collared shirt. You feel them a bit in a T-shirt but definitely not terrible. For the earbuds they're sufficient for the style. There's drawbacks with what it takes to get a rubber ball into your ear and have it be a relatively sealed/tight fit.<br/><br/>Noise cancelling : Works quite well. Turns the annoying whirrr of a server rooms several hundred 40mm fans into a pleasant "white noise" sound of the ANC taking over. I was actually surprised about this feature as I didn't even get what it was until about 2 weeks after I bought it I saw the switch. It definitely taxes the battery though.<br/><br/>Audio quality : I was VERY with the audio quality. I would consider myself a self-proclaimed "audiophile" but not the type who is willing to spend exorbitant amounts of money on audio equipment to listen to music in less than idea environments Bass is solid, the mix is sufficiently spread. It may not win awards but it is definitely good sound across various types of: death/metal, instrumental, electroswing, ambient music, etc.<br/><br/>Call quality (audio) : Calling with it is good. A lot of times I need both earbuds in to be able to sufficiently hear the other party but the nature of the earbuds definitely help a weakness of mine when it comes to hearing. I'm happy with how it sounds on calls.<br/><br/>Call quality (talk) : I've gotten a few complaints that it can be hard to hear me in some situations. I've also heard that it has zero noise cancelling tendencies for calls so the other party hears EVERY sound around you. I've not yet verified if ANC helps with this. I doubt it does.<br/><br/>Convenience : It works fine for me. I haven't much used the speech based dialing or other features but I often switch the headset between my Pixel XL, Galaxy S6, and ASUS Zenbook, for various applications. It's even possible to (sometimes, often intermittently) get it connected to a phone AND the laptop at once. This is great and an unintended feature. Often to get it to break a pairing I have to turn it off, turn it on, and quickly try to pair from a phone/device and it's usually the first device to grab the headset successfully.<br/><br/>Overall I'm VERY happy with these earbuds. I wish it had ambient noise cancelling on calls, but the other features work so well I would buy again.</span>

<span>Okay, so. First off i'll admit I was influenced by the previous negative comments, especially comments from users who have had previous versions (HBS 700, 730, 750). I bought it regardless to give it a shot and so far after heavy use, i've learned to use it effectively and quite enjoy it. It isn't without faults but it still is quite good despite the reviews. This device was evaluated over 1 week paired to an LG-G2 and rocketfish USB adapter for PC<br/><br/>PROs<br/>- smaller LED light<br/>- despite popular consensus the ANC DOES work and it will work even if you aren't listening to music. It will drain the battery quicker but its good to cancel high range external sound if i want to take a quick nap.<br/>- the dedicated call and play/pause keys make it a lot easier to figure out which side is which<br/>- contrary to popular consensus from users upgrading from the HBS 700 and 730 the overhang over the buds while it rests actually helps keep the buds in their place. i normally hide the headset under my collar while I work so my previous 700 had the buds constantly getting knocked out of their place while i worked. this hides them and makes it harder for them to come out by themselves<br/>- the magnet holding the buds in seems to be stronger compared to the 700. I can only comment from the 700 to the 800<br/>- much lighter than previous versions<br/>- more ergonomic around neck with slight curve in band<br/>- audio/call quality improved from 700<br/><br/>CONs<br/>- the cables are shorter so i have to do a bit of maneuvering around my collar when i use it, not a massive deal but just an extra subconscious step.<br/>- battery life IS shorter compared the the 700. but don't let that deter you, it still has a massive battery life with the ANC off and while resting in standby compared to other brand headsets<br/>- the multi-access bluetooth seems to prioritize audio from desktop computers only giving preference to phones for calls, not a major issue but makes using the multi-access a pain<br/>- the range is diminished in windy areas limiting range to distances as short as 1.5ft in certain windy circumstances<br/>- the switches are a pain to operate. i became accustomed to slipping my finger over the switches but end up having to use my nail to operate on/off and ANC switches<br/>- this isn't necessarily a CON but i don't understand what the JBL audio gives to the system overall. all i can tell is that it allows you to notice equalizer changes<br/><br/>I can understand the issues previous users have had to deal with while getting used to the device. It requires a learning curve that most people who are used to the previous device don't want to bother with. One such example not categorized above is how to return the buds to their resting cradles. instead of holding the buds i find its better to hold by the cables and slide from under and let the magnet pull it in.<br/><br/>at the end of the day i say go for it, if its not for you Amazon has a brilliant return policy.</span>

<span>Sounds fine, except when you try the unique gimmick of plug and play with the wire jack, the audio quality drops. The other gimmick of the bacteria killing lights is whatever. My main issue with these is how difficult it is to open the case. You can't just fumble them with in your pocket to open them and take out the buds. You have to actively make sure the orientation is right so you don't try to open from the hinges and dig them out. Occasionally these things will fall out of my ears from time to time. Spending $200+ on these and I can't help but feel buyers remorse.</span>

<span>When I cut through the clear tape holding the box closed, I thought okay, another pair of ear buds.  I got this pair when I saw the video of Linus, showing how it was with a pillow.  I wanted something as a back up to my Boss Sleep buds, that I use at night.  My other Bose, was having battery issues after 5 months.  It was past there 90 day return policy.  These are thin on the side.  Haven't tried sleeping with them yet. But they don't bulge out.  If you go with these, download the app.  Adds features and you can see what is set.  Buttons are easy to operate.  I would grade 4.5 plus. I base a this off Jabra 75T.  With the Jabra, I can actually hear other conversations in the office, when I'm not sitting near those staff members.  hmm. an item to remember maybe when going out... night club...<br/>These are easier to place in the ears than Sony's XM4.  I donated the other older Bose., didn't want to try the new ones. ie. issues with the Bose Sleep., also had issue with the Bose over ear.  Had to return two different units on that item.<br/>These are much more solid than the Klipsch.  I do like the wireless charging pad., sort of the reason I kept the earbuds.  Thought the older Sport set, I do use at the gym.<br/>Now to the set being noted as New.  smile.  This set connected with my Samsung Tablet.  Without me even trying.  When I checked out the tablet, it informed me these were Angelia's LG Tones', smile.  When they connected with my Samsung Ultra, i renamed them.  I put the large Silicon ear tips on, which were in a plastic bag.  With the UV light that comes on, that warms them up., is a bonus.  If you pull out a earbud, they turn off.  Phone quality.  A co-worker I called was able to hear me really well.  I might try other ear tips I have to see if I can get a better seal.  I like my music.  I stream from 4 groups right now, so I have more variation.  Pandora, Qobuz, bandcamp-which is free and Amazon Prime.  I haven't tested these on any of my DAC's.  I usually wire in when using those.  Astell&amp;Kern is my light weight pocket fav. SR25 w/leather cover.<br/>Next is iBASSO Audio, DX240. easy to use.  The others are more warming bricks with short battery life.  I like this pair.</span>

<span>Owned for a few months and the two halves of the right earbud shell separated exposing the inside. Still works, but that really sucks.<br/><br/>I don't like that you can't fully customize the taps on the sides of the earbuds.<br/>No multipoint, which should be standard these days!<br/>Also got a weird echo thing on a call, so I don't know what was up with that.<br/><br/>All of that said: Sound is good. Transparency mode is pretty good. ANC is just ok. More comfortable than Jabra 75t's. The airplane feature is really nice for frequent flyers.</span>

<span>I picked these up to wear around the office and they are great.  I have had no issues with them connecting to my iphone.  I love the auto-pause feature when I take them out of my ears.  This works on music and videos.  The noise cancelling works well, however I have it set so I can hear if someone is talking to me.  As much as I would like to drown out the office environment sometimes, I need to be able to hear others at times.<br/><br/>I have these and a pair of Anker SoundCore Liberty Pro's.  Sound wise, Anker takes it, just because those seal nicely in your ear, but these do sound great regardless.  Comfort wise, these are far more comfortable and lighter.  Sometimes I forget I even have them in.<br/><br/>If you're on the fence, pick up a pair.  I am glad I did and have not been disappointed at all.</span>

<span>Have had these for 3-4 months, I like them and would recommend them for this price point, but they do have some drawbacks.<br/><br/>PROS:<br/><br/>Sleek look, both headphone and case, high quality feel and materials. High audio quality, comparable to Bose earbuds I’ve tried. Fast charging time. The case can also be connected to any media device via audio jack, which then transmits the audio to the headphones- I like this for playing guitar directly from my mini desktop amp into my wireless headphones for practicing at night.<br/><br/>CONS:<br/>I would rate higher but the battery life is meh, maybe 3-4 hours outside the case, and the case surprisingly only can recharge them fully maybe twice so 10-12 hours total I would say. This is ok but I find myself having to charge the case once every 3-4 days, as opposed to my ATH m50xBT over-the-ears which last for weeks without charging. “Active” noise cancelling is also not great… honestly feels like when ANC is on, it sounds like what you’d hear with a regular pair of earbuds on- muted environmental sounds- and when it’s OFF, the headphones pipe in sounds from the environment through the mics, which was a bit strange at first and took some time to get used to and can also lead to surprising crackles and pops when mics pick up sound of door shutting, object hitting floor etc. I wasn’t necessarily after high quality ANC though so not a deal breaker for me.<br/><br/>Overall quality headphones and would recommend as long as the drawbacks aren’t an issue for you personally.</span>

<span>First a few things of note:<br/>- They do NOT go all the way in your ear, rather sit just outside it.<br/>- The FP5s are pretty comfortable, I've worn them for hours straight without pain. (All depends on the user)<br/>- Passthrough works really well, it sounds like you are not wearing anything, however you do need the app to enable conversation mode.<br/>- Bass: it's there, and powerful enough to feel with the bass boost profile active. However, not overpowering.<br/>- Sound quality: On par with the Sony WF-1000XM3s, so pretty good.<br/>- 3D sound stage: Mediocre, feels kind of like you are playing the music through a box, but it works I guess.<br/><br/>- NOISE CANCELATION is GOOD, but NOT the BEST, better than the $30 headphones, but no match for a set of **Sony WF-1000XM3s**. It won't make a crowd disappear without any music playing. However, anything that drones like HVAC, fans, road noise. Gone. You will not hear that stuff with noise cancelling on. (your mileage may vary)<br/>***Now when you are playing music, the noise is gone. The noise cancellation in these really only makes it so that you don't have to destroy your ears to drown out a crowd.***<br/>I play my music at about 40% volume with noise canceling on normally. I went to a convention and only had to turn it up to about 50% while in line waiting for registration. I tested it without noise canceling and had to turn the volume all the way up to 80% to only hear the music. That hurt too much- So I went back to using noise canceling.<br/><br/>--------<br/><br/>Final thoughts:<br/>If you are looking for something that isn't too expensive, that has a name brand (I kindly request that all of the $30 competition leave the room) as in not $30 trash that breaks in like 2 months. I would go for these. It's priced in the mid-range, not trash, but also not $279 for the Sony's. They fill a pretty good niche. For sure more comfortable than that apple hard plastic airpods trash.<br/><br/>- Worth the buy at $80-90 if you want quality for cheap.</span>

<span>So, I’d been looking around for a while for the perfect paid of ear buds: not too expensive, good fit, quality sound and easy to set up. I hit the nail on the head with these LG ear buds! It was super easy to pair with my iPhone. The noise cancelling feature works like a charm and the sound quality is spot on! They box came with different size buds to ensure the right fit, but I didn’t even need to change the original pair out! I’ve used them to listen to music, watch online  videos and take calls. Quality audio each time! I haven’t gotten to go running with them yet but I imagine they’ll stay in place. Happy with the purchase overall! The only drawback is they’re sensitive to the touch, so just be mindful when touching them while on a call or listening to music.”</span>

<span>Sound does cut off at approx. 18000Hz where human hearing tops out at around 20000Hz. Only noticeable if you are running tests or do professional audio work.

<span>These headphones were awesome when they worked. Unfortunately one year later they kind of broke. They become loose with use and still worked but only if you pinch the tops back on and hold them tightly. I tried supergluing them and that worked for a while, but they came loose again.<br/><br/>I'm hoping it's simply a design flaw and the manufacturer is aware of it.</span>

<span>I am a ride or die LG fan. So much I had to buy these when I needed a pair of headphones.<br/><br/>That being said, I got them September 2021.<br/><br/>They finally broke today. I was cleaning off grime and it came off.<br/><br/>These have had dodgey problems since the 3 month mark.<br/><br/>Imagine working hard at the gym and sweating into them and ruining the mic for about a week until it fully dries.<br/><br/>Imagine your sweat activating the feature I hate the most, ambient sound. Imagine sweat stopping a video mid set at the gym.<br/><br/>Imagine, that annoying pairing sound just happen muffling the media you're listening to. Why does it attempt to re-pair as if I unpaired it?<br/><br/>So yeah, they were flawed they served me enough where I'm not upset but tbh they're nothing special and towards the end the ambient sound being the default when turned on is excessively annoying.<br/><br/>The confusing volume controls and accidentally calling someone because you touched it weird is just annoying.<br/><br/>It's LG, I like LG, I have and use it paired to an LG phone. I like LG as a brand.<br/><br/>It's really just nothing special and you should consider that if you intend to purchase.</span>

<span>This review is based on the past experience from an average person who have used several bluetooth earbuds. Those bluetooth earbuds include Lypertek Tevi, Anker Soundcore Liberty Air 2, Samsung Galaxy Buds Plus, Plantronics BackBeat Pro 5100, and Jabra Elite Active 75t. I will compare to Galaxy Buds Plus and Jabra Elite Active 75t as these are more recently used products.<br/><br/>Review is based on 19 days usage with the model without the uv-nano cleaning feature and was used with an iPhone 11 Pro Max, Samsung Galaxy Tab S6, Dell work laptop, and a Windows 10 pc using a bluetooth dongle.<br/><br/>Pros:<br/>- Lightweight, comfortable, and stays in my ears during my daily activities. Other bluetooth earbuds I have used stayed in my ears well, but would slowly fall out (more often on my left ear) when I am eating or talking to someone extensively.<br/>- Case is small and round which feels good in my hands and in my pocket.<br/>- Magnets holding the earbuds are excellent unlike the Galaxy Buds plus' magnets.<br/>- Call quality is great and blocks good amount of ambient noise around you.<br/>- There is an app for both Android and iOS with several features which includes EQ, ambient mode level, touch control options, and etc. The options' sequence changes automatically based on the option you use frequently.<br/><br/>Cons:<br/>- Feels cheap<br/>- Flat sound and lacks the thumping bass like the Jabra Elite Active 75t's or Anker Soundcore Liberty Air 2's. You can choose bass boost in the EQ settings but is not comparable to the models I listed above. *Please note that this may not be a CON for you*<br/>- Ambient mode is not great and sounds robotic.<br/>- When listening to music with ambient mode on, ambient mode cuts out and turns back on whenever you skip to the next music. This was a not an issue with other bluetooth earbuds I tried.<br/>- No sidetone or ambient mode during calls to hear your own voice.<br/>- In my initial setup using the App, it took three tries for the software update to install successfully.<br/>- You hear static sound when listening to music on a Windows PC or a Windows Laptop even using the STEREO mode. I tested this by listening to the same section from a song with the devices listed in the beginning of this review. No static issues with my iPhone nor Galaxy Tab S6.<br/>- Battery life is okay but less than Jabra's or Galaxy Buds Plus.<br/><br/>Edit:<br/><br/>Additional Pros:<br/>- Left or Right earbuds can be used independently unlike the Jabra's where you can only use the Right earbud independently.<br/><br/>Additional Cons:<br/>- No multipoint connection where you can connect to two devices simultaneously like the Jabra's<br/>- Not hot-swappable like Galaxy Buds Plus where you can connect to another device and it will automatically disconnect from the previous device.</span>
