The Tracer Opaque Art Projector by Artograph is a versatile art projector for the novice to experienced artist or crafter. A long-time favorite of the Artograph line of opaque art projectors. The Tracer enlarges any design or pattern onto a wall or easel from 2 to 14 times the original size. The projected image can be traced and colored as desired. Great for artwork sketches, outlining, posters, signs, small murals, home wall decor and decoration, quilt patterns, and more. No set-up is necessary, and it is simple to operate. A dark room is required for maximum visibility.

<span>This one replaces the one I bought decades ago, that I recently dropped down the stairs.  I mainly use it to insure the artwork is the exact size I want and exactly in the center or elsewhere on the piece. Use in a very dark room, any amount of light is your enemy.  As you project futher away you will lose the sharpnes of the lines.  This operates with a light bulb and a basic lens.  This works great for what it is designed to do.  If you want bigger images buy a better lens and a brighter bulb</span>

<span>Works great, you just have to have a really really dark room or you can't see much. I like it and will continue to use it</span>

<span>I needed to transfer my artwork to surfboards. This saves me tons of time and I can trace the outline or everything.  This is my second one. I rely on this product.  My last one loaned to a friend. I never saw it again bc she moved and kept it. I couldn't even get mad<br/> I knew she loved it too. Huge value for your money so I bought another. Great construction,  lightweight, easy as pie to use.</span>

<span>1. The environment needs to be VERY dark in order to see any detail.<br/>2. About a 4 or 5 mm gap in the plastic at the front that light leaked through, contributing to poor image quality.<br/>3. Focusing is accomplished by moving the head in and out instead of turning it like the construction of the unit suggests. Very imprecise. And is impossible to do with one hand because its so light.<br/>4. The weight is so insufficient that just the pull of the power cord caused it to move.<br/>5. No active heat removal, wouldn't want to put this product on anything of value.<br/>6. Light source was a none directional, household lightbulb scattering light everywhere the vast majority of which was not in the direction (through the lens) it was needed.<br/>7. Lenses are not sealed, and will accumulate dirt and dust quickly, which you would mistake for part of an original artwork, and there was a  spot on the  lens, (couldn't tell if it was a defect or just dust).<br/>8. Edges of projection were very poorly defined.<br/>9. No keystone, lateral or horizontal adjustments at all.<br/>10 ETC. You get the idea.<br/>I know this is a low cost very entry level piece of equipment and I should not have expected much for $95.00, but even the cheapest (much LESS less than $95.00) digital projector has sealed lenses and height and keystone adjustments, (keystone adjustment is critical if your media surface isnt perfectly parallel to the lens, like on an easel) cooling fan, fine focal adjustment and available hardware for mounting.<br/>  In my opinion, you're infinitely better off buying a digital projector for this purpose.<br/>Obviously I'm returning it.<br/>Thanks.</span>

<span>I have been using a pico projector for three (3) years and it finally took a dirt nap, on the eve of receiving my next replacement. My setup was perfect; a middle of the road tripod for support, Bluetooth speaker (JBL Charge) with transmitter for sound, 26100 power bank (anker) for power, and an iCODIS G1 Mobile Pico Projector for image. I could watch video on a remote island for up to 10 hours without a household power supply.<br/><br/>After the lose of my current pico projector I decided to find a temporary replacement while I wait for my Phillips PicoMax to be build and shipped I stumbled upon this Kodak Luma 150. The Luma 150 had all the makings to be a great upgrade to my previous G1, which lacked some features but was a solid unit for the last three (3) years. I was excited to see that this unit would charge via micro USB as my G1 did, big plus to extend the viewing time, offer wireless connection for my laptop and phone, an HDMI input, and USB &amp; microSD.  I was even more excited to see keystone correction, even if it was just vertical only, step up from the G1. It did lose points for not having a remote, but I figured this was temporary and it was not greatly needed, although it would make navigating the SD card easier.<br/>Now that I have received my unit and had a chance to get hand on with it I have some insight to help any potential purchaser and am open to information to change my experience. The unit is of solid construction and great portable size. I will highlight my positives and then address my negatives.<br/>The Good<br/>The focus wheel; smooth yet firm to ensure the focus remains where you want it and able to adjust in fine increments. The touch buttons; good reaction time, although you must push the center button to activate the controls. Tripod mount; perfectly located in the center. Image quality; good brightness (best in low light rooms), good picture quality (note the native resolution is 480). USB/MicroSD; Works great supports my video library (avi), however only supports FAT32 (32 GB or less)<br/>The Bad<br/>Vertical keystone correction; missing, this feature does not appear to be installed on the unit I received, however when you go to the Kodak website for this product this feature is not highlighted. I contacted Kodak support and I was told it should happen automatically within seconds, however, they could not tell me what the angle correction was for this unit, leading me to believe this is not available in the Luma 150. Menu; When you start the unit you are greeted with a menu offering your inputs, wireless, video, image, and HDMI. This unit lacks a settings menu, for video (brightness, contrast, etc), Audio (stereo, level adjustment, etc), and other features. Volume control; (minor peeve) the volume is on a scale from 0 to 100, which is great however it increases in increments of 10 giving you 10 levels of volume only. I suppose this is adequate but why not just have the scale from 0 to 10, only makes sense. Speaker; (unimportant in my opinion but reviewing it still) the on board speaker is barely loud enough (at 80) or it is crackly (at 90+). I ma not sure why pico projector manufactures even bother with a speaker, it wastes space and only works if you holding it next to your ear. I have found a Bluetooth speaker with transmitter or one that plugs in work the best and is needed. HDMI; (this possibly was only my experience) I usually us my Roku with my pico projector and when I connected it to the Luma 150 my Roku stick it did not display an image and heated up beyond safe ranges. Then I attempted to connect my DVD player this time no audio (likely a incompatible codex between each device).<br/><br/>In conclusion, I will be returning this device and wait out the three to four weeks until I received my PicoMax without a pocket projector. This unit has a good purpose and someone other than my-self may be in need of this purpose, But Buyer beware that the advertising of Auto Vertical Keystone correction is false.</span>

<span>I make decorated cookies and bought this projector 2 years ago. After 2 years it just stopped working. It didn’t charge, or it seemed like it was charged but turned off automatically after a couple of minutes.<br/>I thought it had completed his cycle after 2 years or using it and decided to buy a new one this year in March. I started to have the same issue after maybe 5 uses. It doesn’t charge. Light indicates it has charged but turna off almost immediately. I cannot return it any more.

<span>I've had this little unit for a couple of weeks and I am very happy with it. I only omit 1 star because of the fact it would have been nice for the projector to come with adapters for the mini inputs it has (mini hdmi and mini vga) as they are a less than common wire type and I had to buy special cabling to make best use of it. The tripod stand they include is a nice perk, but having heavier material built into it to prevent tipping and moving would have suited it better. As other reviewers stated, if you use any kind of heavy video wiring it'll likely send this toppling and tipping without any real effort.<br/><br/>That said I'm impressed. I hooked this the hdmi out of a gaming computer and played Skyrim on it. Yes the lower "quarter HD " resolution meant the extreme finite detail was lost in the game, but it still ran it (game ran at 1080p) and the game looked solid and text was totally legible. I hooked it to a xbox 360 and ran Sleeping Dogs and took it through some fast driving sequences, and it did great. I tried it with youtube video and also using a converter that swapped vga and analog audio into a single hdmi and it did that nicely as well.<br/><br/>I then hooked it to a ps3 running older ps2 games (the original fat ps3 with ps2 hardware installed in it, not the emulated variety) and was surprised to see it give off bright, vivid colors and great detail.<br/><br/>Running it in a pitch black room is the "ideal" as it will look vibrant and well lit up to about 40-45" corner to corner. I ran it in my office (some light coming from window but mostly dark) and it looked great displaying about 30" big. I tried it with the pc in my basement workshop (a lot more ambient light due to multiple windows) and it was washed out but still very visible projected onto the white concrete walls. Whewn we tried it on the xbox it was on a off white painted wall in total darknedd and in partial (single lamp on) light and it looked great. And finally trying it on the ps3 on an actual projector screen with lights mostly off and totally off, it looked like any other projector.<br/><br/>One thing I appreciated was since it isn't using a large bulb, you don't get the "glare" hotspot some projectors have if you throw the image exactly front and center to the screen. I also love that it can run off the battery for some time and is virtually silent while it is on. Also, hooking a speaker to this via the headphone out jack produced really solid, clean audio. The speaker in the projector works, but unless you are sitting right by it, it's not going to sound all that great or loud.<br/><br/>I am going to use it for travel entertainment in the future, so I got this projector, a converter so vga and components stuff converts to hdmi easily, and a bluetooth speaker with USB charging capability. Currently I can fit all of this, including connecting wires, in the speaker's packaging and so have a portable 40" tv I can quickly set up and run off of 1-2 outlets anywhere.<br/><br/>The bad:<br/><br/>some mild rainbow effects were visible when quickly panning the camera in certain games where a high contrast line or object was visible, but not too bad.<br/>Will do 60fps well but didn't see it ever go above this. Fast full screen movement produces slight blur typical of this since it doesn't have any kind of smooth vision/frame filling.<br/>Adjusting volume and other settings in the projector menu is less than perfect. Having a volume slider on the unit would have been much better, but since the internal speaker stinks, I guess it is not so much a concern.<br/><br/>The good:<br/><br/>Surprising clarity despite lower resolution.<br/>Bright enough to see well in dim rooms, very bright and vibrant in pitch black.<br/>Great color and clarity projected up to about 40-45" but also worked well stretched across a 100" screen (just washed out/poor contrast).<br/>Can adequately display console gaming (at least xbox 360/ps3 and older) as well as pc video and audio like a champ.<br/>Silent and cool.<br/>small (it is about 2/3 the size of my galaxy note II)<br/>lots of inputs (usb, microsd slot, mini usb, mini vga)<br/><br/>Highly recommended for something getting casual use, travel use, secondary monitor for business people, or possible mounted in a kid room to watch cartoons or games for cheap. It won't make a stellar home theater projector as a primary function, but it'll do most everything else well enough!</span>

<span>Been playing around with this thing for a couple months and I can say with all honesty I love it.  Mind you I wasn't expecting a truly high-end projector for the price I paid, so one could say I am just easily impressed since my expectations were not that high to begin with.  But in all fairness this thing works as advertised and meets all of my needs, so I feel I should give credit where credit is due.<br/><br/>Some people have complained about the flimsy build, subpar speakers, short battery life, flimsy tripod and connection problems, but to those I say in order of listed complaints:<br/><br/>1) yes it seems to be cheaply made of plastic, but hey its a projector.  Not something you're supposed to toss up in the air &amp; play catch with while walking down the street.  I advise being careful with it.<br/><br/>2) External speakers are cheap and can be bought with rechargeable batteries, so if you really need better sound you can get a mini powered speaker to carry with you.  I like that it comes with a headphone jack so I can listen to it outdoors in the pool area of my condo complex at night without having to worry about disturbing any neighbors (it's so cool, it's like reliving you drive in movie days from when you were young).<br/><br/>3) Yes the battery life is pretty short and it can be a problem showing full length movies on it.  But short films as well as movie clips or youtube clips or music videos or episodes of TV shows are just fine for this thing.  I use it mostly for anime showings with small groups of friends when we are out instead of having to meet at someones house.  And the fact that it has a built in media player means I don't have to go out and buy a laptop and drag it around with me along with a bunch of cables and whatnot.  This is truly a portable solution for what my needs are.<br/><br/>4) The included tripod seems sturdy enough to me.  True if you're using outdoors on a particularly windy night you might want to keep one finger on one of the legs just to make sure the wind doesn't topple it, but other than that I haven't had any problems with the tripod continually tipping over.<br/><br/>5)  Yes the HDMI port is a mini HDMI, and truth be told I haven't tried to go out a get a cable and tried hooking it up to my Blu-ray player or anything, but the fact that it can run off a simple flash drive is plenty for me.  I have an SD card too but so far haven't even needed to try it as the flash drive option already works great .  A cheap $5 4 gig flash drive will hold more than enough video for an hour or hour &amp; a half showing or presentation, which is all the battery can handle.  And I especially love the fact that as mentioned above I don't have to carry a separate laptop or PC and a bunch of cables &amp; extension cords.  I just whip this out of my shirt pocket and pull out the tripod &amp; a flash drive from one of my other pockets &amp; BOOM...I have an instant set up for a mini showing with friends at most any meeting or private banquet room when I'm out with any special interest group.<br/><br/>Of course the projection quality is not true HD, but unless you're a big videophile or home theater enthusiast you should find the quality pretty good.  Heck it's downright silly to expect the same quality video image from this thing as you get from your multi-thousand dollar home theater system.  I can watch videos with subtitles and read them just fine with this even in just dim light settings (not the greatest choice for a setting with bright lights, but then again that's what the more expensive high end projectors are for).<br/><br/>Most all my friends to whom I've shown this to have all been impressed with it as well and I would highly recommend this for anyone needing a cheap, no frills solution to portable video needs and as an alternative to gathering around a laptop screen every time you want to show something cool.</span>

<span>This projector is absolutely brilliant. I've had it for s few months and had it practically every day.<br/><br/>It performs better than the other projectors in the $150-200 price range. It works perfectly at night and fairly well during the day with the blinds up, which is unheard of for a projector in this price range. The color contrast and to tonality is also spectacular.<br/><br/>The speaker is good but not the best. I strongly recommend hooking up a streaming device (fire stick, Apple TV) and connecting that device’s audio to a Bluetooth speaker. I currently have a fire stick connected to the projector and a Bluetooth speaker connected to the fire stick and it’s a perfect set up. I’m upgrading to a Bluetooth surround sound system next and it should still work fine.<br/><br/>The projector fan is a little noisy but not intrusive when you’re watching something. You will only notice it when nothing is playing.<br/><br/>The projector is also super light and easy to mount using a shelf or a projector bracket. Honestly cannot recommend this product enough!</span>

Long story short, she applied for and sent a replacement projector (DR. J 1080P). She expedited shipping and it arrived within a couple days.

<span>So far no issues with this. Seems to work as expected. I got this as a warehouse deal and for 40$ it was a steal of a deal! I'm going to be using it for so many crafty projects such as wall murals, I can use it for stencils on cookies and cakes. Just so many amazing uses! I'm so glad I jumped on this deal cause I probably wouldn't ever pay full price for this. Super stoked that I received such an amazing deal and honestly don't see anything wrong with it. It was a total score. Not sure how easy to find replacement bulbs will be but I'm sure I'll figure it out.</span>

<span>I am sorry to post so negative an evaluation because I think that normally this is a very good projector for its amazing small size. The problem for me is that I could not get it to project the screen of my Kindle Fire which is important to me as an author of Kindle books. I read all the other customer reviews. I thought that I was having a connectivity problem and ordered connecting cables recommended by other customers. One particularly was projecting from his Kindle Fire. However, nothing worked for me. In fact I could not project from my cell phone, desktop computer or my laptop. By the time I tried all the different possible solutions I could no longer return the projector as defective. It did project the image of the word "MAGNASONIC" and then the words " No signal" which I could focus as a sharp image. I found several reviewers that had similar problems and gave the same rating I am giving. There was a reset hole but it was not described in the instructions for the PP60, but I found instructions for reset for another Magnasonic projector. I tried the reset with a paper clip as described in those instructions, but had no positive results. It appears to me that some of us got projectors that were defective in picking up signals from other devices. Also I did not find help from the manufacturer or supplier. One user who was paid for a review apparently received help directly from a customer service agent, but I did not. The only service offered was from a separate agency with a front end price tag which I was not sure was a trustworthy source so I was not willing to give credit information.

<span>Got this for sales trips, where mounted projectors are not always available.  This is smaller than a cell phone and simple to use.  Turn the switch "on" and connect into an HMDI port.  It'll project within seconds. You can connect to an iPhone with an adapter.  Only a few limitations:  (1) Adjusting projection size is limited to how far it is from the projection screen/wall.  (2) Not as bright as larger projectors, but adequate with lights off.<br/><br/>Your going to be disappointed if you expect the same quality and performance as a $500 projector that's the size of a 90's phone book.</span>

<span>I give this a 10/10 it is a bit difficult to understand at first, but also I don’t like reading the info on how to I rather just figure it out. But it’s as expected. Don’t expect it to be clear like a tv if you are using it for outside, I think I tested it inside for a second but it was a bit brighter inside. The volume on it is pretty decent. The setup for linking it with my laptop was easy as well. I am impressed it was really nice at my Halloween party! Should have taken a picture.</span>

It is literally right under the projector lens at the front.  Makes it hard to keep from tipping back because of the displaced weight.  Bad design.  Other than that its a good machine for the price.</span>

<h3><h3>Can you use a projector for tracing?</h3></h3>
    

Yes, you can use a projector for tracing.
<h3><h3>Do real artists use projectors?</h3></h3>
    

Some artists do use projectors in their work. It can be a way to get an interesting effect or to create a certain mood. However, not all artists use projectors, and some who do prefer to use other methods instead.
<h3><h3>How do I project an image to trace a wall?</h3></h3>
    

To project an image onto a wall for tracing, use a projector. Position the projector so that the image is projected onto the wall you want to trace, and then use a pencil to trace the outline of the image.
<h3><h3>How do you make a projector for tracing?</h3></h3>
    

To make a projector for tracing, you will need a cardboard box, a sheet of paper, tape, and a pencil.
