<span>This got an old high end LCD monitor with a broken stand back in service quickly and easily, and best of all at a fraction of the cost of a replacement.<br/><br/>Adjusting the tension is sort of a trial and error process, but took less than 10 minutes to get it dialed in.</span>

<blockquote><em><div class="a-row a-spacing-small review-data"><span class="a-size-base review-text review-text-content" data-hook="review-body">
<span>easy to put together and easy to put on monitor. 27in will fit on it. down side which is also due to my own error. it's not very tall. it won't stand very high, I believe 14in at most so if using a bigger than 24in may not be worth it.  but it is sturdy does work.  just not what I needed.</span>

<blockquote><em><div class="a-row a-spacing-small review-data"><span class="a-size-base review-text review-text-content" data-hook="review-body">
<span>I really thought this was going to be perfect for my needs but the base along with the stand make it stick out almost 12 inches from the wall which limits my desk space. Hope they make one with a smaller base and also the stand is very thick and not very sleek looking. Loveee that this is one of the few ones that can be adjusted up and down without having to turn any knobs, but unfortunately the other things kill it for me. Oh well, my search continues.</span>

<span>I am pleasantly surprised on the durability and quality of this mount. It’s solid. Only downside is that you really can’t share your desk since it’s takes awhile to readjust up/down (screws instead of pneumatic system). But once you lock it in, you really don’t need to adjust if you’re not sharing a desk.<br/>Easy to assemble. Instructions were perfect. Clamp to mount to desk is SOLID. You won’t have to worry about it coming loose. VESA mount fit perfectly with my HP wide screen monitors. Love the cable management clips.<br/>This worked so well I decided to the VIVO under desk keyboard tray. I turned my 1990’s college IKEA desk to a state of the art computer work station with these 2 products. Again, these products are made well.</span>

<span>For what you pay, this monitor stand is amazing.  It has great range of motion, it's easy to use, and it is exactly what I wanted.  The only negative I can think of is that the portion of the base that goes underneath whatever you clamp it to, is on the small size.  You can turn it to be either vertically or horizontally aligned which helps but thinner or softer materials (think particle board) could potentially wear out and cause a tear out.  I personally solved this with a 1/4" piece of plywood about 4 inches square.  I recommend this monitor stand.</span>

<blockquote><em><div class="a-row a-spacing-small review-data"><span class="a-size-base review-text review-text-content" data-hook="review-body">
<span>I have two 27" monitors and was worried they would not sit together with enough space for adjustment because it is the max size the bracket can hold. However, based on the measurements in the pictures for the product I felt there should be enough room for the monitors to be adjusted less then 180 degrees from one another and decided to order. That turned out to be the case and I am able to adjust the angle enough so the monitors look good next to each other and are firmly supported.<br/><br/>There are plates that mount to the back of the monitors and slide into brackets at the end of each arm. It's sturdy and easy to setup. The height, forward tilt, and side tilt adjustments are very simple to manage plus there is another adjustment mechanism I did not know about. When sliding the monitor into the bracket on the end of the arm there is an adjustment screw that allows you to adjust the monitor up and down vertically so that it sits level with the other monitor. It's not much, maybe 1/4", but it helps offset the difference in my monitors because they are two different brands.<br/><br/>It also has two mounting options, which is great. You can use the included clamp or there is an option for it to be mounted through a cable hole, if your desk/table has one. There is also ample cable management to keep your cables hidden from view. Nice.<br/><br/>Overall, I feel like the stand works well, is sturdy and easy to install, and looks great.</span>

<span>I really like this desk mount. It's opened up a ton of desk space, and being able to raise my monitors has helped my posture, as well. It's sturdy and easy to put up, and works well even though my monitors are two separate sizes. There's only two things to be mindful of - for one, the arms don't move independently of one another, so keep that in mind if that's a feature you're looking for. The other thing is that if your desk is against a wall and you have acoustic panels behind it, you won't be able to push the monitors super far back because the arms will hit the panels. My desk is large enough that this isn't an issue, but it might be if you have a smaller desk.</span>

<span>I'm sorry I didn't review this before - I LOVE IT!<br/>I did buy it because it was the only dual monitor stand that does not require a vice grip around the desk, which is good because my desk is a solid piece with a drawer and no ability to use a vice.<br/><br/>That being said - it is HEAVY, it is a bit unwieldy. If you are not comfortable functioning with heavy equipment, a second person would be advisable, if only to stabilize the arms and base. The whole stand is not really heavy, but combined with the arms, and the monitors, that extra person will help.<br/><br/>You must use a second monitor to balance out the weight - or it will lean.<br/>And you should be prepared to bend the arms and compress the space so that it balances. That being said  - it does function well. And aside from connecting new ports for the monitor, adjustment has not been necessary, and has been VERY STABLE.<br/>(Currently used with two Asus VA24DQ monitors. It is at the corner of the desk, one piece of the base along the back, one along the side. The Arms extend about 180 degrees from each other.)</span>

<span>People reviewing this have commented on tipping and close calls while putting it together.  I put mine together on the carpet.  I put a foot on one side while loading the first monitor.  Then picked up the entire assembly and out it on my desk.  It was very easy, very sturdy, and the perfect height.<br/>My desk suffers from a lack of a lip to use a vice mounted one.  This is excellent.</span>

<span>It's a good stand, just be aware that if you use two 27-inch monitors it will fall over easily due to being top-heavy. Just get a something to secure it you a wall and you're all set.</span>

<span>As with most things 3m makes, this is a good product.  These aren't fancy.  They aren't made of Adamantium or Mahogany.  Thats not to say they look terrible, but they were not made with appearance as the first consideration.  Many products are made that way, which is why products like this stand out.  Those products are designed to do a job related to aesthetics.  This is designed to do a job related to monitor height.  Which is why this is a better product if what you want to be able to do is adjust the height of your monitor.<br/><br/>It comes with a black base, and 4 'legs'.  Each leg is itself comprised of three stackable pieces.  Each stackable piece adds around 2 inches to the height of the stand.  For instance, I currently have one piece for each leg.  Where the stand meets the monitor base is about 2 and a half inches from the table.  I haven't tried just putting the stand tray on the table without any legs, but it looks like that would sit as flat as the table its on would allow.<br/><br/>So maybe the only thing to note is that because the pieces are 2" each, that is what increments you can adjust in.  This doesn't have really granular fine tuned adjustments.  But you're paying $30.  That doesn't buy mechanics or gears or whatever that will do that job and hold up for years.<br/><br/>As said above, it's not made of any premium or fancy material, but it does seem sturdy.  Not a perfect analogy material or construction wise, but think about legos.  You can stack those, pull them apart, kick them around, and step on them for years without making a mark.  I expect these will maintain their form and function for years.  The plastic won't bend or change shape.  Nothing will sag or become uneven.  The pieces will fit together smoothly as long as you dont actively try to alter points where they meet.<br/><br/>As an added bonus, from the inside of one leg to the inside of the other leg is around 10 or 11 inches, so even if it isn't an ideal storage spot, it returns some extra desk room of sorts.<br/><br/>I bought two of these larger stands  for my two 23" monitors to be sure the stand was big enough.  It turns out I shouldn't have been concerned.  There is several inches of tray on either side of the monitors base.  Anything that will accidentally knock them off these stands, would knock them off of anything.  They aren't even close to hanging over the edges.</span>

<span>I bought 2 of these to use at work for my 2 monitors. After relocating from one company building to another, my original monitors didn't follow me, just the hard drive. My monitors are now mismatched and only one is able to raise up to sit at eye level, the other monitor will not stay raised up due to a missing piece that holds it up. These monitor stands work great. I love the fact that they are adjustable by adding or removing sections of the legs, almost like Lego blocks. Even fully extended my monitors sit much higher on the stands than they did on their own, which is a plus for me. I don't get neck aches or migraines as much now that I'm not having to look down at my monitors. The stands are a pretty sturdy plastic, hold up under the weight of the monitors which can be pretty heavy for their size. The stands aren't too bulky either, they fit right under the monitors and may only stick out a few inches in the front which gives me a place to keep my handy office supplies within reach. I even like that the legs are completely removable so the stands are easier to pack up if I have to move desks or locations again. Looking for extra space to store office supplies, the space under the stands is a great area for additional storage of printer paper or files.</span>

<span>In my opinion this is far superior than those laptop racks with angled support surfaces. Frankly, you need to realize the fact that if your need to raise the laptop screen to your head level, then there is no real way that you can effectively use the keyboard of your laptop. The only practical way is to connect it to an external keyboard. Once you realize this, this type of flat laptop supports shows its superiority. It is simpler, more stable and less prone to damages. Best of all, it can also be used for displays without adjustable heights (and that is how I am currently using it).</span>

<span>Working from home at my old desk was killing my neck.  I needed something that put my monitors up about 6-7 inches (and didn't know exactly sure where I needed them).  I bought two of these stands and they have been working very well.  While getting the setting adjusted properly was a little trickier than it should have been, these stands have a wide range of height.  I'm running 27" monitors, and they seem to have no problem with the weight.</span>

<span>I can now sit up straight while at the computer. A new wireless keyboard was needed, because the stand raised my computer up 6 inches.</span>

<span>This was the cheapest monitor stand I could find that would attain the height I needed. I'm glad I bought it for that purpose. However, I knocked off one star for design, and another for price as a result of the design (ie. it clearly didn't spend much time in a development phase).<br/><br/>The adjustment mechanism is clunky and time-consuming. There's literally 6 joints you have to adjust and then readjust to find the right height and slant. It does come with a cheat sheet and numbered dials that you can memorize to adjust to your preferred settings.<br/><br/>For that reason, it's best if you don't plan to use the stand in a variety of heights, or share with another person who has different height requirements. I use it to provide a bit more overall desk space underneath while allowing my head to stay in an upright position.</span>

<span>I bought this for work at the reception desk to put our phone on. we needed something that brought the phone up higher than a phone desk stand because our receptionist has some height on her. It works fine for what we needed but was awful hard to get it to adjust even so we could set the phone on it. we would adjust one side and then the other side would be all tipped and then we would adjust that and it would tip the other side. we finally got it though. I would not trust it with anything too heavy like a monitor because I don't feel the legs are real sturdy. they lock in but I feel it's wobbly when it's more than a few inches off of a desk. it works but we will see how long it last... may be years or maybe weeks. who knows!</span>

<span>I was happy to find this because it's nearly impossible to find a monitor stand that goes above six inches. For a standing desk, you need more than that to get the monitor to eye level. This one goes to inches, so I bought it. It does have some flaws, but it's difficult to tell what was done in manufacturing and what happened during shipping. The stand is simply shipped in a cardboard box. That's it--no padding of any kind. It fits the box perfectly, which means any damage do the box is damage to the unit. The corner of mine has a dent, so I turned it around backward, but the back side has a gnarled edge in the metal. Was it battered in shipping? Maybe. Also, some of the holes in the top piece weren't cleanly cut. So it seems there's a mix of imperfect machining and delivery damage. Nonetheless, it's still the best monitor stand I've found. I'm happy with it even in its slightly damaged state. It's still sturdy and functional.<br/><br/>Note: I just wish it were even a half inch wider at the legs. That would be enough to slip my keyboard beneath it. It's just a tad too narrow, so I can't make use of my desk space for other things when I need to.</span>

<span>This is exactly what I needed to keep both my personal and work laptops together on the same desk without having to put them on top of each other and cause overheating issues. I keep my 15 inch work laptop below this mount and my 17 inch personal laptop on top of it. It is the perfect size for both of my laptops. Now all I need to do to use each one is to plug my docking station into whichever I want to use at the time. It should be noted that I cannot open my work laptop while it is underneath this mount. But that is perfectly fine by me since I have a docking station that I connect all of my periferals to.</span>

<span>Awesome and sturdy stand - Even more awesome company behind it. No really, it's true!<br/>This originally wasn't for using as a monitor or TV stand, but for a different project. Since I still have my old and bulky PS3, I have actually bought that stand which does the job nicely, having the old PS3 under it and my new PS4 on the top of it (see photos).<br/><br/>Since some part under the PS4 tend to get really hot after gaming for a while, this stand was the perfect choice, since it has a metallic and vented surface instead of plain plastic like many other stands I saw on Amazon, so the console's heat can dissipate better, and stay cooler longer too.<br/><br/>Stand came in a nice box, including some 3M foam pads for the feet and some kind of small user manual. Stand looks awesome and is easy to set up. Also, along with the advertised 3 holes settings for each legs to raise the stand to the desired level, it have some convenient fine-tuning adjustment of each legs, which is actually all I needed to set mine and level it correctly, since the table I used it on wasn't super flat everywhere.<br/><br/>Since I saw lot of question about how much load this stand can handle, and according to what's written on the packaging, this stand is reported to be pretty sturdy and could support up to 35lbs (or 16 Kg).<br/><br/>The stand I ordered was new but still arrived with a small dent. But no worries though, the awesome company that made those offered me to exchange it for another new stand in no time. I always love a company that stands behind their products. BIG thumb up for that!!</span>

<span>I needed a monitor stand that could stand off to the side of my desk, that was adjustable in height, and adapted to my small office space. Allsop's Ergo 3 stand was all that I needed. Underneath the stand sits a LG UBKM9 4K Ultra-HD Blu-ray Disc™ Player for when I want to watch or listen to media. A nice space saver depending on how and where it is used. Ready-to-use out of the box, no mounts to deal with, simple and purposeful.<br/><br/>I recommend this stand to anyone who prefers versatility, accessibility, and maneuverability over permanent wall mounts or desk mounts.</span>
