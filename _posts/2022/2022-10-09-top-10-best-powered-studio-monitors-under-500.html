<span>This is my 2nd PreSonus system.  My first was a much bigger speaker system for my studio/band room and works great for both band practice and just vocal singing to backing tracks learning new songs to play out. I have not mixed yet on them but that will come soon. Now on the newest members to my speaker familey my desktop E3.5. Just needed some speakers for my computer room that I have hooked up to my Fractal Axe-FXll Xl guitar modeling preamp. So I can stream music off YouTube and practice new songs for my band or just work on new original songs for my other project.<br/> The PreSonus Eris E3.5 ROCKS my world in a big way. The speakers have great bass response for just small speakers, I can even practice bass guitar playing or just check out new music on YouTube. They are a very good balanced mix on all music and great dynamics too!  I have to say have to watch the output level cause they do get very loud, but keep the music clear and focused with no distortion at all. I just can't believe PreSonus small footprint of desktop computer speakers system can sound this good. Well they hold up, that's still to be seen but so far all my PreSonus speakers are doing great, it's a great company. My drummer own there recording software and loves it.  I will have to say PreSonus, you hit another one out of the ball park with this package. Great Job guys!!  Oh, by the way shipping was killer too, very fast and nice people as always. Thanks Amazon! :)</span>

<span>This would be an amazing set of powered speakers if only there was not constant, audible white noise. The problem gets worse when a bluetooth device is paired, it goes from just white noise to another, crunchier sound that can easily be heard from several feet away.<br/><br/>I have the speakers wired to a UPS outputting a true sinusoidal waveform. I have also plugged it into a power conditioner with the same results. The level of the noise is not affected by the volume knob.<br/><br/>It's a shame because the sound is otherwise great. Unfortunately the constant noise is a bit annoying. I ended up moving the speakers a little further from me (~3' from my face) and raised them so the tweeter is above my head and it's not so noticeable.</span>

<span>First of all, I think it's important to state my usage:<br/>I bought these for my desktop - Music, gaming, youtube etc.. I don't edit or create music/videos.<br/>After 1 day of usage:<br/>Build: Decent. Nothing to write home about.<br/>Bass: Lacking. Good enough for most music genres ,but if you're into electronic , you might feel the bass is lacking. It's there, just not the soft wrapping bass you know sound systems with big speakers or 2.1 (with subwoofer) systems.<br/>Metal/Trance music : I think the lack of bass is very noticeable here. It's missing big sound that makes you zone out.<br/>Gaming: Good. No complaints. I can hear everything loud and clear.  In some racing games more bass would be nice to feel the engines.<br/>Loud volume: The mids and highs are clear, but the bass can't catch up and start to sound like farts.<br/>Hiss: I don't hear any.  I use the original cable connected to an external (USB) Creative sound card. I did order RCA to 1/4 cables for it for better audio.<br/><br/>My first response after 1 hour of use was contacting Amazon for a return.  Then I found out that some some of my music sounds extremely good on these.  I was surprised.  So I canceled the return and now trying to figure out if I keep them or not.  I am starting to see what people like about these speakers.  With that in mind, I would probably recommend others to go with the Edifier R1700BT speakers for non-pro usage. The main reason I don't want the R1700 is because bluetooth cannot be disabled which is quite crazy if you ask me. Anyone in your building can take over with two taps (even while you are using them).<br/><br/>So for now I think I'll keep the Presonus.<br/><br/>Remember: You need sit pretty close , and the speakers should face you (create a triangle with them and your head). Height - around  ears height , but you can just use the cheap stands to create angle towards your ear.<br/><br/>Bottom line - if you care about clarity and you're not a bass-head , these are great. For most people these are an overkill anyway.</span>

<span>Looks 9/10<br/>Materials 7/10<br/>Sound quality 8/10<br/>Bass 7/10<br/>Volume 8/10<br/>Setup 6/10<br/><br/>The sound quality is pretty decent until you go up in volume - it seems a little weak on top and bottom at the highest volume levels.  Overall bass is not bad, but not spectacular.  I wonder how accurate the sound really is.<br/><br/>The overall appearance and construction look pretty good but the materials aren't particularly high-end.<br/><br/>My one big gripe is that there is nothing built into the back or bottom for easy mounting to stands so I have to buy some stands that just grip the bottom like a clamp.<br/><br/>These may not be ideal for recording studios, even the bedroom variety, but overall a pretty good value for the price.</span>

Building on JBL's legacy of high-quality sound performance, the MkII series represents an upgrade of the impressive LSR3 series. These compact, professional quality, powered studio monitors retain the 3 series' image control waveguide for incredible detail and imaging, and the broad sweet spot that means you get optimal sound even off-axis. The MkII series now features updated high-frequency (HF) and low-frequency (LF) transducers, which respectively provide optimized damping for superior transient response and greater linearity that allows impressively deep bass with lower harmonic distortion. Upgrades also include new boundary equalization (EQ), which restores neutral LF response when speakers are placed on the work surface and adjacent walls. Hear for yourself why JBL is legendary in sound performance and quality!

<span>At normal listening levels -- below pain/OSHA hearing damage threshold -- this speaker is fantastic.<br/><br/>On-axis performance measured from six feet away in a room with a hard floor followed a Harman target small room curve. Individual near field measurements of the tweeter and woofer were flat along the Harman down sloping curve. I didn't check off-axis because off-axis performance will follow the design engineering conducted by JBL. In this case, the primary purpose of testing the on-axis performance is to see if I received a product with a manufacturing defect. For example, one of the components in the speaker could have been damaged during manufacturing or transport.<br/><br/>Like all stereo channel speakers, you'd need to add a separate low frequency system if you want complete hi-fi sound but that's a limitation imposed by listening to music inside a room not the speaker. If you don't want to mess with that complexity this speaker will play down to 50Hz to give the impression of full sound for casual listening.<br/><br/>I'm tempted to say this speaker is as good as it gets for residential living space sized rooms. I won't go as far as that because speakers can be designed to produce different sound fields for different applications. But for a regular speaker this speaker is really (really) good. Or maybe I can say it this way: if you listen to this speaker and don't like it you can be sure the problem is not the speaker. Maybe the speaker is sitting in the wrong part of the room (e.g. jammed into a corner or up against a wall), maybe your signal source is bad, maybe you want an entirely different type of speaker, or maybe one of the speaker components has a manufacturing defect or got damaged during transport. Which brings up a point, you could use this speaker as a reference to trouble shoot your system. That's a big deal because speakers are normally the weakest link in a home system.<br/><br/>If you had an expensive stereo system set up by someone else and you wanted to find out if it was actually good you could buy these speakers to compare. There are a lot of very expensive stereo speakers out there that aren't as good as these speakers. Which brings up another point, if you practice listening to these speakers you will be better equipped to identify snake oil. You can use these speakers to teach yourself how to not get sent down rabbit holes by well-meaning audiophiles who don't know what they're talking about. There are some well-meaning audiophiles out there who are unwittingly influenced by aspects of the speaker that have nothing to do with the sound of the speaker. They sell you snake oil without knowing they're selling you snake oil, they're innocent dupes. In the context of audio performance, you would need to have a really good reason to buy speakers more expensive than these and you would need to be sure you knew exactly -- through personal listening experience -- why you were spending that extra money. On the other hand, if you want a pretty speaker that looks beautiful in your room then absolutely spend the extra money. Just make sure the pretty speaker sounds as good as these JBLs. These JBLs can be your reference.</span>

<span>I've had a pair of Rokit 5 monitors on my desktop for a decade. They don't get used very often but have always sounded great when the occasion to use them came about.<br/><br/>Recently one failed; it just started buzzing one day.<br/><br/>I ordered a "Classic" to replace it since it appeared to be an exact replacement for the one that had gone bad. But it turns out that the "Classic" is actually an updated version from what I had, with an incredibly annoying feature: it goes to sleep (probably intended as an energy saving feature) and won't wake up again unless I send a *very* high input level to it.<br/><br/>So now I have this brand new speaker to replace my old one, except that when I need to play audio through the rig the only one that comes on is the old one. In order to get the new one to wake up I have to CRANK the volume from my computer...and then it still has a delay of 5-10 seconds before it comes on.<br/><br/>I get that the idea was probably to save energy when the speaker wasn't being used, but the implementation is TERRIBLE; sleeping is okay as long as it will actually "wake up" when it's needed. Unfortunately it doesn't.</span>

<span>I bought my first pair of the Elevate 5 (Mk I) about six years ago, purely for personal use at home.<br/><br/>I wasn't expecting a lot for the price, but they impressed me greatly.<br/><br/>So I started buying them at work for use in our edit booths, as we have rebuilt the whole post side of the studio building over the past couple of years. I haven't gotten a single complaint about them. I'm an electrical engineer, not a mixing artist. I can best describe the sound as almost completely neutral. They have none of the artificial low-end boominess which seems common in low-cost powered monitors, they just deliver a solid, linear sound across the whole spectrum. With near-zero perceptible distortion even when I drive them up to "this is bordering on uncomfortable" levels.<br/><br/>Fast forward a couple of years. I just bought a new house, and it has a huge kitchen. I decided that I wanted a good speaker system in there, as I tend to rock out on Pandora when cooking, and wanted to upgrade from my old kitchen / yardwork headphones, as they deprive me of situational awareness such as the sounds coming from the stove.<br/><br/>I demoed a few sets of bluetooth-native powered monitors at a local music shop, and just wasn't impressed by any of them.<br/><br/>So I decided that I'm just gonna live with using an external bluetooth-to-RCA adapter which I already had lying around, and ordered my ninth set of these (and second for personal use) yesterday.<br/><br/>Figured that with that kind of purchase history, I owed them a review.<br/><br/>They're just phenomenally great speakers for the price. Are they Genelec 8030s? No, they are not. But they're 90% of the quality for 20% of the cost.</span>

<span>the only reason i knocked off a star is because you have to use 1/4 inch wire to connect them. other than that, i have them hooked up to a scarlett solo and a presonus eris 8 studio subwoofer.<br/><br/>scarlett solo -&gt; presonus 8 inch sub -&gt; these<br/><br/>thats how i have it wired and honestly i cant explain to you how good these are for the price. adjust volume on these and your sub, adjust the low pass filter on your sub till you hit the sweet spot and youre good to go. they are great for music production. i used them by themselves with no sub for a year and i gotta say, having the sub makes all the difference. all frequencies sound better when ran thru the sub's amp. of course the bass is better with a sub, but they pair really well with the presonus in my experience. before you spend $300 on one yamaha or krk, i would say get these. great value. alesis is a reputable brand that has been around a long time. if you dont have money to burn on super high grade monitors, these will do just fine. just remember, more expensive equipment doesnt make you a better producer.</span>

<span>I will update this once hooked up but wanted to mention that the package had a impact hole 4"x3" that went thru outer box, inner box and finally the actual speaker box. Theres just a hint of mark on the speaker itself about 1" long. Interesting is that its not visible from outside because Amazon had taped up the outside hole with 2" black box tape. Update later if decide to return it. NOT impressed with Amazon putting tape over the hole but maybe it was a precaution, IDK but it means you could not see the the box damage from the outside.<br/><br/>Update: No issues with speakers - they are great.

<span>In my experience, I got these (8s), but they did not reproduce the sound as well as my DT 990 PRO headphones. The music just seemed flat on delivery, not juicy, maybe mid was too strong, not sure what it was. While all frequencies seemed to be represented, it just seemed like something was getting lost. Maybe the bass wasn't punchy, although it could be when I turned up the bass on my mixer, but it was still off the mark. Maybe I could get it just right by tuning them, but I figured if I disliked them out of the box, it was better to go with something else. I got the Yamaha HS8, which do a much better job imho. I am a layman, though, and maybe that's just my experience, there are lots of raving professional and user reviews about these.<br/><br/>The build quality and appearance on these is great, btw.</span>

<span>This would have been REALLY nice to know before I went and spent an additional $20+ on a footswitch and cable that I now have no use for. Nowhere on the description or images does it expressly say that a footswitch is included, only that it has a port for footswitch capabilities. I really do hope this review will be helpful to someone who's considering making the purchase.<br/><br/>That being said, everything else I'm very satisfied with. My first speakers were CR3's from Mackie, and I liked those so much I went and upgraded to MR624's, and liked those so much that I decided to purchase this subwoofer. If a company is good to me, I'm loyal and Mackie has been good to me. But dammitall, I spent a good hour doing price points on footswitches and shopping for the right one and buying a cable and all that extra jazz all for nothing just because they failed to briefly say "footswitch included" or even BETTER just include it in the product pictures.</span>

<span>Upgrading from Tannoy 402 Reveal speakers. These Mackies are great. Very good bass response and excellent overall sound quality. I compared to several others in this price range and found them all to have pluses and minuses. The Mackie seemed best overall to my ears, but I don't think you can go with Yamaha, JBL, Presonus or KRK. These are relatively inexpensive speakers and compare very favorably in their category.<br/><br/>The 1 star off for me is that they sound a bit bright to my ears... maybe too much so. This is quite minor. The bass response is better than others and I found this my deciding factor. Competeing speakers have their negatives that I won't mention here... but the Mackie were my top pick - none are perfect.<br/><br/>Overall they are clear, crisp with deep bass and very pleasant to listen to. Would I choose again? Absolutely. They are a really really big upgrade over my Tannoy's that are about two years old.</span>

Rockville APM8W 8" 2-Way 500 Watt Active USB Studio Monitor Speakers in White (Pair)Beautiful finish is matte with a slight shine to it. Our designers spent a lot of time on the color to make it beautiful and elegant looking to improve the appearance of your studio or roomWe developed the Most Optimized Magnet structure, Cone, and Cabinet Space that Reproduces the Sound to Play Back Exactly the Way it was Recorded!Our factory uses the latest Precision Glue Machine (Over 500 meter Tunnel Oven). To put it in simple to understand terms; the glue on speakers is of the upmost importance. If the glue does not hold up, the speaker is done. We use the latest machinery to manufacture these speakers. The SPL of the speaker goes up when you use better glue and a better machine the secure the glue in placeThick &ldquo;Wadding&rdquo; protects inside the speaker cabinet &ndash; Wadding is a white chemical silk type of material that we put inside the speaker cabinet for multiple reasons. It helps to make the sound come out more clear, and it also protects all the parts inside the speaker. This material is also a fire retardant. This is unique to our speakers. Most other brands do not take this step due to the cost of the material, but it is a game changer!World class top of the line audiophile grade components! We use ADAU 1701 for audio processing and TPA3116 for amplification. These are both known to be best in class circuit designs. These components also are amazing and allow us to adjust the sound via soft programing on a computer during the design stage to get the perfect sound.

<span>. Those are only 50w like the 3" as well.<br/><br/>I haven't heard the "static" that others have mentioned in the reviews, (though there is always going to be the "noise" that Class A speakers have) so I just could be lucky I guess. I recommend to others if it's that noticeable exchange them for another pair, they are really fantastic speakers.<br/><br/>I absolutely LOVE these things and they can really put out some noise. They could easily be loud enough for a good sized house party, they just wouldn't have enough bass to give it a real "club" feel. Just using them in my studio I leave them at about 1/4 power and if I'm really jamming I still never get above 1/3 on my mixer.<br/><br/>They sound really crisp as well, they don't distort. They put out a good clean sound - that can also get quite loud as well. The only thing I wish that they had that the Mackie CR3s have is Bluetooth - not for hooking up for producing, but just to jam out with or hook a phone up, something of that nature. But I can easily hook a headphone -&gt; RCA cable up to my mixer (or the speakers themselves), so Bluetooth isn't that big of a necessity.<br/><br/>As far as my credentials for judging/rating these speakers (as opposed to some one who equates volume-that-makes-your-ears-bleed with quality sound) go:<br/><br/>I've been a DJ for 13 years spending over a decade of gigging in clubs around the city - for a good stretch of it every night of the week. As far as pro audio goes, I learned from a guy I DJ'd with. He's a classically trained club owner, musician, and also a promoter in the business for 20 years at the time I began working with him. He (and later I) setup the majority of the city's local clubs' sound and lighting systems. For big shows and events he is usually the one to rent gear from when the clubs needed to rent gear (for the gear that's in the artist's riders). Even if not needed, we generally ran sound for the big events as well.<br/><br/>Seriously, buy these speakers. This is by far the longest review I've ever written (not just on Amazon), but I wanted to make sure I got all the information in here to support my argument as to why I can't recommend these enough.</span>

<span>Let me start by informing you that I have owned only passive monitors with a dream of one day being able to have a set of nice active monitors.<br/><br/>I am really picky when it comes to my sound. With previous passive monitors, I would bring them to the music store, and pair them up with different amps so I could find the best sounding amp that worked with the monitors. It was a fun adventure, but being a parent and not having the free time, I knew I needed to go active for my next set.<br/><br/>I didn’t have the funds to drop $1000+ on active 8inch monitors so I started looking at smaller speakers. The Rockville 5inch caught my eye and found they made 8 inch versions for under $500. I couldn’t figure out why they got my attention (Other than the price point) as I hadn’t even heard them in person or heard of the brand before. I watched these speakers and did 8 months of research (literally started looking up EVERYTHING I could back in June). From how they are made, where they are made, the types of materials put into them, quality control tests the company performs, different vendors that sell their products, countless hours of online videos, cause I couldn’t believe I found a quality active 8 inch monitor for under $500.<br/><br/>Finally, (after approval from my wife of course) I made the purchase. Upon receiving them right on time compared to the estimated delivery date, I unboxed them and let them sit inside for 24 hours before I plugged them in. I started the break in process with listening at low volume for 20 hours, then I started increasing the volume. I still haven’t taken them over half volume and my neighbors asked me if I had a full blown PA system in my house.<br/><br/>They are CLEAN sounding, they get loud without distorting, and they are nice to look at as well. I have ran music through them, electronic drum kit, I used a DI and a pedal to put my guitar through them and all of it sounds astounding. Warm rich tone that isn’t boomy or too full of bass. Just a nice balance.<br/><br/>My only complaint and because I have to nitpick a little. The power switch is on the back which I found mildly inconvenient, they are hooked up to a surge protector/power conditioner now so I don’t have to reach behind them to shut them off or turn them on anymore.</span>

<span>As a DJ with a LOT of equipment (reviews for many of that stuff in my profile), I'm that "you can never have too much equipment" guy.  ONE thing that I was sorely missing, though, was a decent pair of studio monitors to do my practicing with.  My "lab" has subs and PA tops, but these are too loud to practice on and when turned down as low as possible, do not accurately display the musical range.  My recording mix-down are has monitors and a sub, but that's not in the practice area.  So, getting dedicated Monitors for practicing was a no-brainer.  Currently I have all Rockville speakers for my gigs and whatnot, so it was only logical that I purchase Rockville monitors.<br/><br/>In one sentence: they sound great for practicing on.  But why don't they get 5 stars??? See below.<br/><br/>[THE GOOD]<br/>+ Build quality:  The Monitors actually have a great build quality, both the speaker quality and the cabinets.  The cabinets are SOLID with a horizontal port on the upper back of each one of them.  The speakers appear to be made of some type of PU or rubber.  I'd like to think that'd contribute in mitigating the chance of blown speakers, perhaps?<br/>+ Many Source Inputs:  As the pics in the main description show, there are plenty of industry standard inputs on the rear of the main speaker, these being: RCA, XLR and 1/4" TRS.  The XLR and TRS are a combo jack which works great as it saves space.  There is also a headphone "output" so you can connect earbuds or headphones to the monitors for private listening.<br/>+ Sound: Again, they sound really good.  Very punchy bass, especially for being 6.5" woofers.  The mids and highs are crisp and don't distort at louder levels. On the rear of the main monitor are treble and bass boost and limiter.  You can set the switch for -4d (Bass or treble - separately),  keep the switch in neutral for normal range and also +4 for a boost in either.  I have tried it in all positions and for my needs I leave them at neutral, for more original frequency response.  Also, and here is something that MAKES NO SENSE to me, there is a bass clip light...ON THE BACK.  It's nice they added it, however, with speakers that are primarily used for facing YOU, what good is it to have the clip in the rear, especially since many studios have the monitors mounted, etc.  Maybe it's just me, however, I think it's poor design.<br/>+ Price:  For the size and sound of the Monitors you get, I think $150 is a great price, especially since you can spend more than that on other well-known speaker brands that are only 3" monitors and don't have the same frequency response.<br/><br/>Now for the reason I didn't give this Monitor set 5 stars:<br/><br/>THE INSISTENT HISSING/STATIC<br/>*sigh*  Rockville is known for being more of an audio brand for folks on a budget.  I understand that.  Because of this, they have to cut corners somewhere and, in this case, which I think is the case with many of their speakers, they MUST cut corners on the amps.  All of my speakers, even the subs, have a constant hiss when on and nothing is playing or playing at low levels.  The higher powered speakers I have (all over 1600 watts peak/400 watts RMS) hiss LOUDLY...but that's ok because they are for huge events and no one really hears the hissing because the music is so loud and also, because the music is so loud no one dares stand near them for fear of hearing damage, lol.  The hissing on these are no where as loud as my bigger speakers, but it is there, like low white noise.  I never hear the hissing when practicing or performing sets for recorded mixtapes.  Only when I'm listening back at lower levels do I notice.<br/><br/>ALSO, (and this might not be a bad thing for some) the monitors are REALLY big, with a footprint of 10" x 8.25".  I intended on putting them on desktop speaker stands, but am forgoing that now, due to their massive size.  As a comparison, they are about the size (each) of the wireless sub I have in my bedroom attached to our soundbar.  Just a word of caution to the unsuspecting.<br/><br/>Back to the hissing.  Because of the hissing, I would NOT recommend these for professional studios, where you are trying to mix down recordings. NO WAY.  I actually do my mix downs of recordings at my PC which also has 2 monitors and a sub.  But again, if you are using these for practicing on DJ equipment, then they are perfect.<br/><br/>[I WOULD NOT USE THESE FOR]<br/>* Professional level recording mixdowns<br/>* Low volume TV/Movie watching<br/><br/>[I WOULD USE THESE FOR]<br/>*DJ practicing and mixtape recording<br/>*LOUD Video game sessions<br/>*LOUD movie night/Netflix or Prime and Chill<br/><br/>All in all, I do like these speakers a lot and they crank like no ones business when they need to, without distortion.<br/><br/>As a side note, I attached a pic of my practice area for size comparison of the Monitors.  My MacBook Pro is 15.4", my iPad Pro is 12.9" and my pioneer controller is about 27" long....The Monitors are impressively (for some) massive.</span>

<span>These monitors each bring their calibration certificate, done by an actual living person, and the diagram for each monitor shows, simply, a FLAT RESPONSE. I got them two days ago and very quickly did my first mix with a sound engineer friend (I am a musician and composer), and the difference and upgrade from headphone mixing is unspeakable. Black and sober-looking, these puppies deliver a clean and rich sound, and I sense I haven't explored their full potential yet... Now the next topic: the price: you cannot find these high-ranging quality monitors for this low of a price. The pair costs what one feature-comparable KRK monitor costs. I will be the first to advise to hear all the brands of monitors you can first, because in matters of audio, cost, taste and quality mix differently any one's priorities and music genre. In this price range, these monitors are ultra-competitive, and I would go as far as to say that this pair easily compares to pairs costing $500. If you're not on a budget over $500, I can tell you I am very happy with my active B2031's! Get a pair! (If you're wondering about my set-up: I have these monitors hooked up to a Behringer Xenyx 1204FX Mixer, an Mbox 2, and a Mactel Pro, and they're just a beauty to listen to!)</span>

<span>This was a replacement for an older B203A1 (about 20 years old!) whose amp died. There is no reliable Behringer repair shop near our small town, and Behringer does not make its schematics readily available, so I could not attempt to repair it myself. The new one arrived well-packaged and in good working order. On my first gig, I noted that it was at least 6-10dB less sensitive that the older model. which I had to turn down to match the two. I love these monitors! I use them along with the B2092A sub for small venues because of their sonic accuracy. They have substantial bass without the sub, but the bass is impressive with the sub. The sound from these monitors is superb!</span>

<span>These studio monitors are phenomenal! They are very accurate, and they sound like $500 studio monitors. I've been an audiophile for 10 years and have tried a few different studio monitors but none compare to the loudness and the large sweet spot you get with these. I highly recommend the B2031A with the 8.75" woofer. Heads up though, these speakers are 33 lbs a piece and the 8.75" version is much larger than a bookshelf speaker</span>

<span>Searching for the best Active Bookshelf Speakers was challenging. There are a large selection of different brands and just reading the reviews is not enough. The price range also has a large gap difference. So many questions? If your looking for a pair of Active (self-powered) Speakers, hopefully this review will help with your search!<br/>&gt;Price:<br/>The cost was only $100, Great Price for what it offers! The set-up was also extremely easy.<br/>&gt;Sound:<br/>Pros- It’s a two way speaker. The highs and mid range sound excellent. The Bass with the 3”woofer was surprisingly deep but not overwhelming deep, just enough.<br/>(Note: if your using them for a turntable, I noticed that the closer you have the speakers to the turntable, the Bass gets deeper.)<br/>Con- the only one thing I wish it had would be the ability to control the Tones, the Highs and Bass. But for the cost, I can understand why it didn’t have those options. If you pay for more expensive units, I’m sure that option will be available. I honestly couldn’t find any 1 thing I didn’t like about these speakers.<br/>Overall, I am completely satisfied with the Sound Quality and I recommend them to anyone looking for Speakers on a budget.<br/>&gt;Thickness:<br/>The overall size is perfect and truly is defined as a Bookshelf Speaker. The quality is well built. I actually liked the Green Stripe but it would have been nice to have different color stripe options!<br/>I hope this was helpful, if not and you just want more info. Type in the product name (CR3-X) in YouTube and you will find other great reviews.<br/>Happy Shopping!</span>

<span>UPDATE: The "Dreaded" Hiss!!<br/><br/>I love these monitors! Yes, they hiss as so many complain about. But these are budget speakers and the hiss is so slight, it is hardly a detriment. I'll reduce the rating from 5 to 4 for the hiss. Original review below. Again I love these and, for the price, can't complain one bit. Now for the actual hiss data (I've never seen that on any other review):<br/><br/>Listening position: These are desktop a mere two feet from me.<br/><br/>Hiss Volume (subjective): the same regardless of volume setting, any cable configuration, or no audio cables hooked up. VERY quiet. Far quieter than a computer fan. I am playing ANY audio whatsoever, even at the lowest volumes the hiss is inaudible.<br/><br/>Hiss Volume (Metered): My sound level meter's lowest band is 60dB (measures above 50dB). A versus C weighting did not have any appreciable difference. Used the Fast Response setting. NOTE: I HAD TO HOLD THE SOUND METER **ONE INCH** AWAY FROM THE TWEETER DOME FOR THE HISS TO BE LOUD ENOUGH TO MEASURE IN THE 60dB BAND<br/> - Powered Speaker: 53dB<br/> - Passive Speaker: 57dB<br/><br/>Again that's at ONE INCH away from the tweeter dome. It is below 50dB (where my meter stops registering) just 3-4 inches away. I'm listening from two feet away. Now I have a raging case of tinnitus (high frequency ringing) so I'm not going to be as sensitive to the hiss as normal hearing people. I can hear in my listening position at two feet. At four feet I can't, though I'd expect most people could in a quiet room. My meter doesn't do any lower than 50 dB so I can only guess that the sound level is around 40 dB at two feet and probably falls to the 30 - 20 dB range at three to four feet and beyond. Just a guess. Someone with a more sensitive meter can check :)<br/><br/>Still this is a very quiet hiss, these speakers sound AMAZING, and they only cost $90! I really don't see how anyone could complain. If you need perfectly quiet powered speakers for professional recording, why would you be looking at the CRX line?<br/><br/>These are perfect for the bookshelf, computer desk, or mini bedroom recording studio<br/><br/>ORIGINAL REVIEW:<br/>I only just received these (CR3-X, 3 inch, non-bluetooth) as monitors for a little recording "nook" I've setup in my bedroom (approx 10 ft x 15 ft).<br/><br/>I had low expectations for a powered monitor that was this small. I couldn't have been more wrong! Some users are complaining about hiss. UPDATE: I finally confirmed hiss, took a long time because it's so slight - details above.<br/><br/>All I know is these tiny speakers CRANK. Unbelievably loud for such a small setup! And they sound beautiful! They really wake up with a little power behind them. I have no way of evaluating their frequency response other than to just listen. They seem very linear, no booming or blooming as far as someone who's willing to spend only $90 for powered monitors can tell :) If you need ultra high fidelity, why would you be looking at budget monitors?!<br/><br/>They're tiny, inexpensive, and they will definitely be able to irritate anyone within two rooms of you if you turn them up! What more could you want?! I'm already in love with only an hour of listening and I haven't even used them as recording monitors yet!<br/><br/>As I use these over time I will update this review. But out-of-the-box I am tremendously impressed at the quality for the price. I have no idea what the bigger versions are like... but if I needed bigger monitors I'd probably not be looking at a budget line. The 3 inch are perfect (so far) and exactly what I needed. Thank you, Mackie!!</span>

<span>These are a perfect pair of budget speakers. When i first purchased these speakers, i was worried about the “hissing” sound that people were talking about. Upon receiving them and hooking them up, yes, they do in fact have a “hiss”. Now with me not being a vindictive person, I used them as they were for a few weeks and the sound would almost become nonexistent until i stopped doing what i was doing and sat still looking at my phone or something. I then decided that i could probably fix it some myself, having dealt with an abundance of faulty cheap speakers throughout my life.  After using some handy dandy TRS cables and some thicker gauged power wire, i was able to reduce the sound to a minimum. Yes it’s still present, but no where as bad as some of the reviews led me to believe it would be out of the box.<br/><br/>I think before you consider these you should genuinely ask yourself, “should i spend the extra $100 on a better studio quality speaker?” And the answer to that is yes. If you’re looking for studio quality sound, don’t cheap out. If you’re like me and know how to troubleshoot things to making them better, pull the trigger on these if you’re trying to save money.<br/><br/>In closing, they are in fact an excellent set of speakers. Having been in many concert band performances and marching band shows, my hearing is not the most sensitive to sounds like that. So yes, i do recommend these speakers as a budget option and if you’re not gonna scream and cry over a little speaker noise.<br/><br/>Hope this helps with your decision!</span>

<span>These are really compact but pretty loud for being so small. I got these so when I am mixing I can hear my music the way everyone else will. Also like listening to music from them, very clear and good bass. Happy with them.</span>
