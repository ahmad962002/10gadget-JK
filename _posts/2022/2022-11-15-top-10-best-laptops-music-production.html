<span>I rated this a 4 because all the con items are annoying but not deal breakers<br/><br/>Pro:<br/><br/>- This laptop is a delight to pick up with one hand.  Lightest 17" laptop I've ever had<br/>- Comes with 2 1TB drives, the second one of which can be used for backups<br/><br/>Con:<br/><br/>-"All Day" battery is NOT.  Running a browser and email client gives me about 5 hours<br/>-Keyboard backlight is very dim, too dim to be useful<br/>-Speakers are way, way too low in volume<br/>- This did not come with Windows 11 as advertised, and was upgraded during the setup<br/>- Function key setup is not good, with keys like PgUp and Home on the same key<br/>- No hard drive light.  Why do pc makers think you don't need a hard drive light?<br/>- No light for speaker muting on the keyboard (this is so stupid, no way to tell if mute is on visually)</span>

<span>UPDATE AS OF 8/3/2021:<br/>HP has refused to honor their warranty and denied the repairs requested by their authorized service center. I was told it would cost me about $300-350 to fix. I picked it up and took it to a local company that fixed it for $233. I have been in touch with HP to try to reimbursed for this repair, and they are just giving me the run around. It is apparent that this is a KNOWN DESIGN FLAW (very tight hinges, anchored to and pushing against very weak plastic) and I am not the only person with this problem. (Google it) HP is aware of the issue, yet they refuse to do anything about it and have not fixed the problem. DO NOT BUY ANY HP PRODUCT WITH THIS HINGE DESIGN.<br/>.................<br/>Have only had the laptop for about 6 months. It worked great, but then the casing on the left hand side above the ethernet port developed a small crack. It's a very thin section of very flimsy plastic but apparently it holds that whole corner together because after simply opening the laptop, the hinge popped the casing wide open. I couldn't even close it after that! I took it to a local repair shop to see if he could get it back together because I can't afford to not have my laptop for a few weeks. (I need it for work). After looking at it and trying to get it to close properly, he recommended I take it to an authorized HP repair shop since it's still under warranty. I dropped it off this afternoon and they informed me that, while they will try to get permission to repair it, HP does not typically repair this sort of thing. It's an obvious design flaw, but they will most likely blame ME for damaging the casing!! All I did was open and close the laptop. It's never been dropped or mishandled - EVER! It's only 6 months old and has never even been moved or transported anywhere but in my living room. It sits on my table or my lap, which is the whole point of a laptop. I will know in a few days whether or not they are going to repair it. I will update my review then. Hopefully they will step up and do the right thing. According to both of the repair places and a search online, this is a known issue with these laptops. So why doesn't HP do something about it??</span>

<span>I bought this laptop primarily for college. As someone who has dealt with both devils by the name of Apple and Microsoft, the operating system differences don't bother me (although, one thing I did find is that when I go home and I'm not able to do any gaming, it can be a bit of an irritation, but that was never why I bought this laptop to begin with). The screen and battery life on this thing are amazing. My previous laptops had terrible screens and had a max battery life of about two hours. This laptop, between using it for school, doing photo editing, graphic design, coding, and video editing, can easily last me up to two days or even more. The one thing I will say is that frequently in order for me see things most of the time, I need the screen cranked up past 50% brightness most of the time. I like the touch bar, I barely use function keys in most applications and the apps that do use them have the buttons on the touch bar anyways. I will say though unless you care about the touch bar, a slightly larger battery, and a fan being inside this machine (which for the record, with all of my use of heavy exports and edits, has never once turned on), just buy the MacBook Air. For school especially, it will get you across fine. The 8 GB model is also superb in most of the tasks I need to accomplish. I mean, it has similar performance in what I need for compared to my PC with a Ryzen 3700X, and RTX 3070, and 32GB of RAM. There were a couple of times where webpages tried to use more than 8GB of RAM and that caused some trouble, but after turning on an ad-blocker I never had that issue again. macOS has superb memory management, which allows for someone semi-professional like me to get by with it just fine.</span>

<span>Ok, first things first, this is my first gaming pc because in the past i bought a laptop without knowing much about graphics card and stuff like that, and i wasnt great for what i wanted to do on it, with all that, its was an asus machine it lasted for 3 years, its still working but the charging port needs to be replaced, but as you know thats why i went for an asus machine for a gaming laptop because my previous laptop had a intel hd 520 and still i got some games i got to enjoy and never had a system issue, now this machine is premium to me, the way it was built, the design, the spec, this is really what i paid for and more!! to put it in perspective, i just started playing COD MW and Star Wars Jedi Fallen Order, and it goes SMOOOOTH!!! like, MW i play it on Epic and with RTX on and never had a frame dropped bellow 60 fps, and Star wars looks amazing with this screen. The "bad" (Just annoying to me) stuff that i could say about it is that the armoury crate is the most broken app here, it works.....when it wants, controlling RGB light is alright but if you're buying an asus accessorie with Aura Sync, well i just have to say "good luck with that" because you''ll end up like me and just leaving the mouse be on its own whithout syncing it because 70% of the time it wont work, and the last "bad thing" would be the mouse pad, i mean, i use a mouse so i dont really care, but when im using the machine without a mouse hmmm you from time to time will enable the num pad, but i dont really mind, in 2 days of use i believe i've turn it on by accident like 6 times.<br/>In conclusion if you like asus and if u like gaming well buy this, it looks great, and it performs like a dime.....<br/><br/>PS: the fans are loud but not that loud, if you've been living in silence well it could bother you but if you live in constant noise in your work or house you wont mind like me when youre used to general noise, the fans are like a lego jet or something xD</span>

<span>I have been a loyal ASUS owner for many years. I will never buy ASUS again. I have had to go through 2, now looking like 3 warranty claims, in the 2 years I have owned this laptop. This is their top of the line laptop. The second warranty claim they had the computer for several months, sent it back, it would not turn on. They tried to claim it was out of warranty but fortunately was able to get them to fix it. So finally I received a functional laptop after maybe half a year of delays. Then the computer started acting up again within another year. Armory Crate glitches, causing the laptop to run at an extremely high level, which causes it to overheat. DO NOT BUY ASUS PRODUCTS!</span>

<span>Overall Nice laptop for the price and even came with the necessary screws and cable to add the 2.5 SSD later on. Just wish the paper work would give more detail on compatible drives etc and whether or not the motherboard has a TB limitation. Have a 9 year old ASUS gaming laptop and much as changed for the better, however I do wish the power cord was kept the same length.  It seems to have been shortened over years by at least 1.5 to 2 feet</span>

<span>Many laptops in this price range have the 2070 max Q. this one has the full sized 2070<br/> the 2070 max q lighter, more power efficient, more quiet, and allows for a much thinner build then the 2070.<br/>however, the normal 2070 has ~35 percent better performance.<br/>when you launch a game on this laptop, the cooling fans spin up and the laptop sounds like a fighter jet taking off. make sure you buy headphones too because the sound of the fans will drown out sound from the built in speakers.</span>
