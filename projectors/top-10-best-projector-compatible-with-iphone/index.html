<span>For a simple, inexpensive projector this isn't too bad. Don't expect great sharpness and/or rich colors, but it does whatever it needs to. I had some issues with my unit but I'm not sure if they were the result of manufacturing or shipping: part of the lens was pushed in, so the image would be warped on one side and it would smell of burning plastic almost immediately after being turned on.</span>

<span>I'm using the projector for art projects, but if you're looking to enjoy movies, you might not be happy, particularly if viewing movies during the day.<br/><br/>1. NOT as bright as advertised. You'll need to black out windows considerably to view movies during the day.<br/>2, KEYSTONE correction is limited and only for vertical axis.  I wish this had been stated in specs.<br/>3.  C+/B- for colors.<br/><br/>But...it's under a ninety bucks.  So...either spend $190 or spend $90 for this projector and get what you paid for.</span>

<span>Purchased this for the ability to have movie nights with the kids in the backyard.  It's very versatile, I liked the built-in phone screen sharing over USB with the EZcast app.  It works well once you connect it to the proper USB port (5v out).  Unfortunately you can't play copyrighted content like Amazon or Netflix via the USB screen sharing.  We used a Roku stick connected to the HDMI port instead, Netflix and Amazon worked perfectly.  The built-in speaker is a nice touch, but the sound quality is mediocre.  It's bright enough to watch movies outside, but only after sundown, at dusk you should be able to start watching. Resolution is acceptable for an affordable projector, it supports 1080p input, but the projected resolution is reduced to what appeared to be 720p. Colors are bright, it has manual adjustments and presets.  The lens is glass and seems to be nice quality, it's easy to focus and adjust keystone, it only has vertical keystone correction.  The cooling fan seems to work well, it's a sturdy unit and seems to have good build quality.  The 1/8" aux jack is nice, we connected an external amplified speaker and it sounded much better.  I tested it with my PS4 and gaming was very smooth.<br/><br/>Pros:<br/>Lots of inputs, including EZcast for phone via USB<br/>Bright, works well outdoors at night<br/>Built-in speaker<br/>Aux output<br/>Remote control<br/>Good resolution (720p)<br/><br/>Cons:<br/>Output NOT 1080p<br/>Speaker is small and sound quality isn't great<br/>Foot height not adjustable<br/>With EZcast can't watch copyrighted content on apps like Netflix, Hulu, Amazon Prime, etc.<br/><br/>I'd recommend this to anyone looking for an affordable projector for occasional home use.  I don't think you could do better for this price and this is way better than one of the pocket projectors if you can tolerate a slightly larger unit.</span>

<span>I mostly like it for the size, contrast, brightness. I use it almost every day.<br/><br/>The colors had to be tained down to about half of the default which makes the picture a little pail<br/>nut more reasonable because the default is too "punchy" alot of saturation , which makes the reds really pink and glowing...<br/><br/>it sounds like an old laptop on high performance mode. you definetly hear the fan, but with the movie in the background you forget.<br/><br/>if you want the projector to attach subtitles to the movie it doesn't work. subtitles in english are unreadable, and other language such as hebrew doesn't work.<br/><br/>I think the price is good but you have to know the downsides.<br/><br/>PROS:<br/>size , contrast, brightnes, good white color. sharp if you nail the focus ring by the milimeter. no lag. nice tripod. price. remembers last settings.<br/>good standart light even with battery but for 30 minutes- eco mode is longer. (buying an extrenal battery for outdoor use as it draws only 25W)<br/><br/>CONS:<br/>color too harsh. red is pink. no subtitle support (very important for traveling if you are not english native - now i have to buy a player..),<br/>a lot of light is spread around the picture (like a 20% frame of dim light). no keystone on the device bottons (have to keep the remote with you).<br/>handle gently with focus ring to nail exact focus.<br/><br/>update :<br/>loses focus after few minutes. needs to be refocused after about 5 minutes. and than stays in focus</span>

<span>I normally don't write reviews for products but this little projector blew me away in terms of what it was able to do.  Even though it is small enough to easily hold in one hand, I have come to the conclusion that the P300 Neo is the perfect projector for my entertainment at home and it can probably be excellent for business use, assuming a dim room.  It's extremely simple to connect to other hardware as long as you have an HDMI cable and I was able to connect a thumb drive with pictures and videos and play them off the projector as well.  As long as your files are in a file format the projector can read, you will have no issues!  I reached out to customer support with some questions because the projector was not reading the first thumb drive I tried to connect to it and got an answer pretty quickly!  All I needed to do what make sure I was using a thumb drive 32GB or less and to make sure the thumb drive was formatted to FAT32, so once I switched to an 8GB (was trying with a 64GB at first), I had no issues!<br/>Do not hesitate if you've been thinking about getting this -- I'm glad I did and I'm sure you will be too!</span>

<span>I have had this little projector for over a month.<br/>PROs<br/>It is compact, when it works well, it works mostly very well.<br/>The speaker is "nahhh" but you don't expect great speakers in projectors. It does its job well.<br/>It has batteries although they don't last much unless you have the light source in Eco.<br/>It isn't heavy and mostly delivers.<br/>CONS<br/>1. At least mine has some issues connecting correcly to the cable box. The image is fine, but sound works sometimes, and some other times it does not. The same HDMI source, when used on my old OPTOMA HD projector or on my LED TV always works fine. So the issue is the projector. I took the time of writing to AAXA before writing this review. We exchanged emails with a nice guy called Michael. Most of the time he tried to explain how everything worked and the problem was just mine. After going back and forth 9 times, I finally gave up. He was very nice to apologize but then again, he said that there must be a compatibility issue between my Cable box and the unit (again, the problem was mine and not the unit's). As I explained to him in my last email before giving up, I get sound, another days I don't...on, off...if it is incompatible, it just does not work since the software cannot "work out issues" (it is  not a programmer, it is just a program), so it will not work out what is wrong. If it works sometimes, and sometimes it does not (while everywhere else the connection is always fine), then it is either an issue with the HDMI imput or with the projector's software. That's it. So we agreed to disagree.<br/>2. Other annoying little issues:<br/>a. I put the lamp in BOOST mode, and the projector, on its own, brings back brightness to Standard within 10 minutes. It will just not stay on BOOST (brightest)<br/>b. Focus is very annoying. It is just a short wheel. So if you miss the exact spot, you are off focus. ALSO, if you have it working with the tripod it comes with and listening loudly with the onboard speaker, it will shake enough to move it and to get it off focus. I have to get up every 20 minutes to refocus.<br/>c. This is common of all these small projectors, the interface works but it is awful, and the remote is just garbage.<br/><br/>OVERALL: It is still a nice little projector and it delivers a lot for your buck. It is just full of little nagging issues which very much detract from what could be an enjoyable experience. Their service department is responsive but I wish it tried to solve issues instead of, very politely, trying to convince the user that there is nothing wrong with the unit...<br/><br/>Just because it works, and it is bright (although very often only when it feels like it) and has sound (again, mostly when it feels like it)... 3 Stars.</span>

<span>I debated getting a projector.  Did I really need one? Would it get used?  I finally purchased it to use for a group of teenagers doing public speaking honestly not knowing if I would use it for anything else.  I used for a slideshow at my daughters graduation.  Great picture quality.  We have use it for outdoor movies.  Used it to project a background for my daughters band.  I love it!  It connected easily with the OFFICIAL (important) Apple HDMI adapter.  Picture quality is awesome!  The size is perfect for portability.  Battery life is surprisingly good.<br/><br/>My one and only minor complaint is the sound that comes out of the built-in speaker.  I can't imagine a scenario where that would be close to adequate and it didn't seem to respond to turning up the volume on my phone.  We found other ways to connect sound though.</span>

<span>Picture quality is okay.. a lil fuzzy on fast scenes but does okay.. family enjoyed it. However, I had to plug in my brothers sound bar for volume. With nothing plugged in.. the sound is so faint and you have to sit by it to hear anything.. so don't eat loud food like chips or popcorn. I tried the Bluetooth to my portable Bluetooth speaker and it connected but sounded so very low.. as if it were far away. So I charged up my speaker thinking that was the problem, unfortunately I was wrong. So then I thought maybe my speaker is broken, after all it had been a long time since I had used it. So I went and bought a new one, keep in mind I bought a new speaker that cost $25 plus tax. It was the cheapest the store had at the time. So I took it home and connected it through Bluetooth, unfortunately, it had the same results. So then I realized it's the projector with the problem. I went to visit some family and I tried Bluetooth into their speakers, exact same results. Very very very low. Like you literally have to hold speaker up to your ear to hear anything. So then my brother brought out his soundbar. He plugged it into the projector, and what do you know.. it worked finally. Only thing I hated about that is that I had to keep the sound bar plugged in next to the projector. I wanted to use Bluetooth to put the soundbar behind us as if we were in a real theater.  But luckily with the sound bar the volume worked very well. Worked like it was supposed to. Second thing I didn't like was since I couldn't use Bluetooth option .. That meant more cords and things to plug in. It's an eye sore. And more to deal with. The 3rd thing I didn't like was each time I turned the volume up or down a super loud female robot voice would announce it during movie.. "VOLUME UP!"<br/>"VOLUME UP!"<br/> "VOLUME DOWN!"<br/>" VOLUME DOWN!"<br/>it's annoying.<br/>And the last thing I did not like.. was having to adjust the picture quality every time I put in a new movie or when I had to go to menu settings. I could be watching a movie just fine with good quality, but if I paused it and clicked on menu settings, sometimes I had to adjust the quality in order to read the menu settings clearly. But it's not a big big deal because it's not hard to clear it up.. it's very simple to adjust.. just a few seconds. Other than the Bluetooth not working, its  not a bad purchase.. picture quality is good.. I displayed it on the side of my brothers trailer.  Everyone loved it. I played every famous Christmas movie on Christmas for the whole family to watch outside and play Christmas games outside. It played the Grinch with Jim Carey very clear and the Grinch in cartoon very good. Bright quality.</span>

<span>We recently purchased this projector for outdoor summer movie nights.  I bought the projector because it allows direct use of a DVD (versus hooking up to a separate machine).  The color and picture were clear and crisp on a white screen.  The sound was good, but we chose to connect to a stronger speaker to allow a higher volume of sound.  For the price, it is an excellent machine.  My one complaint is that it is not compatible with Blueray discs.</span>

<span>This projector is definitely not worth more than the lightning price of $118. I only received this a couple of days ago, so I can't speak to the longevity of this projector, but I can share my observations regarding it's performance. So, the things that I like are the built-in DVD player, the lens cover and the carrying bag. The things I don't like are the zoom feature - if you use it whatever ratio/zoom setting you put it on it is then projected onto your screen, with NO way to remove it. I've checked the menu and settings page and written the seller with no answer or resolution provided. The only work around I have found is simply to not use it and move the projector closer or further away. The bluetooth feature has worked, but the sound using it and when plugged into the headphone jack resulted in a buzzing sound. The other thing to note is, if using it with a firestick or roku, when looking at the menu features built into those, it is impossible for all the text to be in focus. If the bottom part of the screen was in focus then the upper portion was not. I guess this is why it states in the description that it is not recommended for PowerPoint presentations. I also found it interesting when looking up this company that Fangor actually comes up on the page. If you've been shopping on Amazon for a projector it's quite likely you came across this brand. Apparently, they are one in the same. Now, what I found most interesting is they don't even show BIGASUO projector anywhere on their product page and they only have two projectors listed. Just seems odd to me. Anyway, that's the good and the bad based on using it once.<br/><br/>Update: The company has reached out to me after becoming aware of my dissatisfaction and I have to say their customer service has been great; albeit a little slow. I have increased the rating of this product.</span>

<span>My wife and I spent almost an hour trying to get this machine to work, and she is very good at setting up electronic equipment.  We were trying to get it to project single photographs off an iPad.  I was using an HDMI cord.  I could not get the projector to respond, no matter how many buttons I pushed, or how many connections I tried, or how many other ideas I tried.  After plugging and unplugging it several times we finally got it to project the photographs.  What a pain!<br/><br/>One suggestion: when you think the set up is correct for the cords, follow the instructions for pushing the buttons, which is weird, and then push the button for each step, and WAIT.  Wait for a few seconds because the projector does not respond quickly or well.  Make sure you push the whatever out of the button when you push it down.  A quick or light tap will not trigger the machine to react.  Once the menu is projected and you are clicking the small arrows up down and sideways, wait until the unit responds on the screen.  Try to make sure you hit the button firmly.  Another pain is, if you wait too long to hit the buttons after the menu is on the screen the menu goes away.  It actually goes away fairly fast.  If that happens you have to start from the beginning.<br/><br/>Once your picture is on the screen, wall, or whatever, there will be a series of buttons along the bottom of the screen.  So, make sure the projector is adjusted so you can see the bottom of the projected picture with the buttons.  I found that trying to move along the bottom buttons was a chore because the machine did not respond to many of my clicks.<br/><br/>IF you are projecting from a micro SD card you will see a button along the bottom that allows you to reduce the size of the picture.  I was able to reduce the size below what I could achieve on the iPad.  You would have to transfer your photos to a micro SD card before projecting them, but that may  be a necessity if you need smaller pictures like I do.<br/><br/>The projected photo is good enough quality for my purposes.  You can see the picture without all the lights off and curtains closed.  I can see the picture in the daylight without any lights on as long as my blinds are closed.  Compared to other photo projectors I have used, which contain a huge lightbulb and a prism to throw the printed photo, this one is quite strong.<br/><br/>Getting the picture small enough to fit on an 11 x 14 area is impossible.  The smallest picture I could get was about 18 x 24.  As a result, projecting an entire photograph from an iPad, and getting as close to the wall or canvas as possible, even the smallest picture will be blown up to a large size.  It would be OK if you were trying to crop a photo or pick out a small area of a photo, but that is about it.<br/><br/>While the artograph prism projector does get a much smaller photo projection, it is also much weaker.  The artograph prism has a big bulb that gets the projector extremely hot.  You can actually burn yourself on it.  The artograph is also far larger unit, and a person must work from a printed photo because it is not digital.<br/><br/>This Bigasuo projector is small, stays cool, and the picture is bright.  A lot brighter than the artograph prism.  The sound isn't loud to me, but the projector noise was irrelevant to my use.  I have heard others that were much louder.<br/><br/>Other problems with this projector include, but are not limited to, the buttons are the same color as the projector, and the symbols telling a person what the button does are very small, mysterious, and not raised above the button much.  The small, same color as the machine, buttons make it hard to adjust the projector.  The amount of focus is slim.  If the lens was able to focus closer the user could make the picture smaller, which would be useful for people like me who want a small bright image.  The HDMI cord is a problem, plus the manufacture gave us two HDMI connections.  And they are not labeled number 1 and number 2.  Why?  Why not another USB port or a full size SD slot?  The micro SD slot is a pain.  The micro SDs are so small I cannot handle them well.  I keep dropping the things.  Why not use a full size SD slot and allow the user to put the micro SD into an adapter to use the micro SD?<br/><br/>I have not tried to use the streaming or video/movie functions.  I have not tried to use the CD functions.  I cannot say how long the projector will last.<br/><br/>Overall, I think the projector is worth the price and should work well for family use.<br/><br/>AD2</span>

<span>For the price, I've found this to be a solid little projector.  Image is very bright, and I like the placement of the controls: focus using the dial on the side, and keystone correction using the jog dial on the back.  The wifi interface works well, but the password dialog doesn't accept long passwords, a minor issue that likely won't affect most users.  My main setup is using an AppleTV device via the HDMI port and everything looks great.  Again, for the price and features, I don't think you can go wrong with this device.</span>

<span>This projector is very bright, quiet when it runs and has the ability to play Dolby Audio (with a license built in), instead of not being able to play it. Everything is perfect, and with the newest release of firmware the picture is so clear, it's an amazing deal...</span>

<span>So we decided to give this a try over a new tv for our gaming and movie nights. Got to say this is perfect for smash bro's with all of my friends. The built in speakers are a great volume for that. When it comes to watching something together it's just lacking a bit. So we went ahead and figured out the bluetooth (had to look up a video on it as it is not mentioned anywhere in the manual). There is just enough of a delay on the bluetooth audio where it drove all of us nuts. So we're going to have to get something that'll use the aux. Not end of the world but would have appreciated knowing that confidently before buying.<br/><br/>Overall I'm already suggesting it to friends. It's really convenient and a lot easier to move around than a tv. If your the type that likes to have people over for any kind of screen time, this is an official need in  your life.</span>

<span>Very good projector for the money. Well-made and relatively easy to operate. The only problem with it is the very low volume of the speaker. You definetely need to buy a good dolby soundbar or else stick your ear to the projector to hear anything. The provided screen is totally worthless; it's just a flimsy transparent veil. If you don't have a smooth large white wall to project on, buy yourselves a good 200 inch screen. But this projector is very bright and responds good to the remote. It mirrors Android very well, and the Bluetooth works fine,too. It's compatible with Dolby sound. I'm very happy with it and recommend it. I had bought a different one of similar price, but had to return it for not supporting Dolby. Also the remote on that one was slow and erratic to act. This one is much much better. After using it for two weeks, I like it even more. I've found out, the hard way, that most problems with the quality of the image are actually caused by a defective screen. After tweeking my low-price screen a lot, I've been able to improve the image to where I feel satisfied. The best screen of all, in my opinion, is a smooth, flat-white wall. Fabric screens present a lot of problems; some are too translucent, others wrinkle easily. But this projector itself renders a very good image, plenty bright (even with one light bulb on in the room).</span>
