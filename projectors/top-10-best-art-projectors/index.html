<span>This is my first review ever with Amazon, and I've purchased many items from them over the years.<br/>Well first of all, when I opened the box, I discovered much to my disappointment that it was a USED PRODUCT!!! I paid for a NEW PRODUCT!!! I Expected a NEW PRODUCT!!!<br/>Secondly, it would not give a sharp image on tracer paper (just purchased at Dick Blick) of the item I was trying to copy in a "low light" room...  It's cheaply made and overpriced!  Absolutely Not worth the Investment!</span>

<span>My wife enjoys making stain glass and got this projector to add art to her templates.  She really likes this purchase because it does what it says it will do. She was up until 3:00am enjoying this thing. She does say that the bulb gets extremely hot and that she plans to change it out with an LED. I think that this projector will get a lot of use and bring great value to my wife and her hobby.</span>

Picture is clear and onboard audio is ok.  Purchasing a speaker to help boost that.  I use my iPhone which plugs in to the projector and plays what ever I want.  I haven't played around with other settings but this does not do Bluetooth or wireless streaming which I thought was ok as all the other's claimed they did but didn’t.  Would suggest for anyone looking for a side projector to do small moves gear and there.</span>

<span>Picture quality is okay.. a lil fuzzy on fast scenes but does okay.. family enjoyed it. However, I had to plug in my brothers sound bar for volume. With nothing plugged in.. the sound is so faint and you have to sit by it to hear anything.. so don't eat loud food like chips or popcorn. I tried the Bluetooth to my portable Bluetooth speaker and it connected but sounded so very low.. as if it were far away. So I charged up my speaker thinking that was the problem, unfortunately I was wrong. So then I thought maybe my speaker is broken, after all it had been a long time since I had used it. So I went and bought a new one, keep in mind I bought a new speaker that cost $25 plus tax. It was the cheapest the store had at the time. So I took it home and connected it through Bluetooth, unfortunately, it had the same results. So then I realized it's the projector with the problem. I went to visit some family and I tried Bluetooth into their speakers, exact same results. Very very very low. Like you literally have to hold speaker up to your ear to hear anything. So then my brother brought out his soundbar. He plugged it into the projector, and what do you know.. it worked finally. Only thing I hated about that is that I had to keep the sound bar plugged in next to the projector. I wanted to use Bluetooth to put the soundbar behind us as if we were in a real theater.  But luckily with the sound bar the volume worked very well. Worked like it was supposed to. Second thing I didn't like was since I couldn't use Bluetooth option .. That meant more cords and things to plug in. It's an eye sore. And more to deal with. The 3rd thing I didn't like was each time I turned the volume up or down a super loud female robot voice would announce it during movie.. "VOLUME UP!"<br/>"VOLUME UP!"<br/> "VOLUME DOWN!"<br/>" VOLUME DOWN!"<br/>it's annoying.<br/>And the last thing I did not like.. was having to adjust the picture quality every time I put in a new movie or when I had to go to menu settings. I could be watching a movie just fine with good quality, but if I paused it and clicked on menu settings, sometimes I had to adjust the quality in order to read the menu settings clearly. But it's not a big big deal because it's not hard to clear it up.. it's very simple to adjust.. just a few seconds. Other than the Bluetooth not working, its  not a bad purchase.. picture quality is good.. I displayed it on the side of my brothers trailer.  Everyone loved it. I played every famous Christmas movie on Christmas for the whole family to watch outside and play Christmas games outside. It played the Grinch with Jim Carey very clear and the Grinch in cartoon very good. Bright quality.</span>

<blockquote><em><div class="a-row a-spacing-small review-data"><span class="a-size-base review-text review-text-content" data-hook="review-body">
<span>My wife and I spent almost an hour trying to get this machine to work, and she is very good at setting up electronic equipment.  We were trying to get it to project single photographs off an iPad.  I was using an HDMI cord.  I could not get the projector to respond, no matter how many buttons I pushed, or how many connections I tried, or how many other ideas I tried.  After plugging and unplugging it several times we finally got it to project the photographs.  What a pain!<br/><br/>One suggestion: when you think the set up is correct for the cords, follow the instructions for pushing the buttons, which is weird, and then push the button for each step, and WAIT.  Wait for a few seconds because the projector does not respond quickly or well.  Make sure you push the whatever out of the button when you push it down.  A quick or light tap will not trigger the machine to react.  Once the menu is projected and you are clicking the small arrows up down and sideways, wait until the unit responds on the screen.  Try to make sure you hit the button firmly.  Another pain is, if you wait too long to hit the buttons after the menu is on the screen the menu goes away.  It actually goes away fairly fast.  If that happens you have to start from the beginning.<br/><br/>Once your picture is on the screen, wall, or whatever, there will be a series of buttons along the bottom of the screen.  So, make sure the projector is adjusted so you can see the bottom of the projected picture with the buttons.  I found that trying to move along the bottom buttons was a chore because the machine did not respond to many of my clicks.<br/><br/>IF you are projecting from a micro SD card you will see a button along the bottom that allows you to reduce the size of the picture.  I was able to reduce the size below what I could achieve on the iPad.  You would have to transfer your photos to a micro SD card before projecting them, but that may  be a necessity if you need smaller pictures like I do.<br/><br/>The projected photo is good enough quality for my purposes.  You can see the picture without all the lights off and curtains closed.  I can see the picture in the daylight without any lights on as long as my blinds are closed.  Compared to other photo projectors I have used, which contain a huge lightbulb and a prism to throw the printed photo, this one is quite strong.<br/><br/>Getting the picture small enough to fit on an 11 x 14 area is impossible.  The smallest picture I could get was about 18 x 24.  As a result, projecting an entire photograph from an iPad, and getting as close to the wall or canvas as possible, even the smallest picture will be blown up to a large size.  It would be OK if you were trying to crop a photo or pick out a small area of a photo, but that is about it.<br/><br/>While the artograph prism projector does get a much smaller photo projection, it is also much weaker.  The artograph prism has a big bulb that gets the projector extremely hot.  You can actually burn yourself on it.  The artograph is also far larger unit, and a person must work from a printed photo because it is not digital.<br/><br/>This Bigasuo projector is small, stays cool, and the picture is bright.  A lot brighter than the artograph prism.  The sound isn't loud to me, but the projector noise was irrelevant to my use.  I have heard others that were much louder.<br/><br/>Other problems with this projector include, but are not limited to, the buttons are the same color as the projector, and the symbols telling a person what the button does are very small, mysterious, and not raised above the button much.  The small, same color as the machine, buttons make it hard to adjust the projector.  The amount of focus is slim.  If the lens was able to focus closer the user could make the picture smaller, which would be useful for people like me who want a small bright image.  The HDMI cord is a problem, plus the manufacture gave us two HDMI connections.  And they are not labeled number 1 and number 2.  Why?  Why not another USB port or a full size SD slot?  The micro SD slot is a pain.  The micro SDs are so small I cannot handle them well.  I keep dropping the things.  Why not use a full size SD slot and allow the user to put the micro SD into an adapter to use the micro SD?<br/><br/>I have not tried to use the streaming or video/movie functions.  I have not tried to use the CD functions.  I cannot say how long the projector will last.<br/><br/>Overall, I think the projector is worth the price and should work well for family use.<br/><br/>AD2</span>

<span>I ordered one of these on Prime day, unboxed it, and the DVD player didn't work.  I plugged it into another DVD player and got it to work, but that really defeats the purpose of this projector.  I exchanged that unit for another one, which appeared to be brand new.  However, it was beyond the return date once I got around to trying this one out.  I discovered that not only had it already been set up (in another language), but the image is super dim and the DVD player doesn't work in this one either.<br/><br/>Edit: I thought I was out of luck and then their customer service department contacted me.  They took extremely good care of me and third time's a charm, this one works just like I had hoped it would.  We've used it in out back yard a couple times, and we've even taken it camping with us!</span>

<span>Our family loves having movie nights outside. Feels like your at the drive-in but without all the other people and it’s in your own yard! We just hung a twin sheet against our house and it worked out great. The picture is really nice especially when it is dark out. Two negatives so far: the sound is very low and it doesn’t play blu-ray (which we knew when we purchased, however it limits what we can watch). We can live without it playing blu-rays but thankfully we had some old speakers that worked out really well. Plan on buying some if you don’t have any already. We haven’t tried hooking up our Roku yet so we plan on trying that next. Very reasonable price and highly recommend.</span>

<span>This is a comparison review with the Yaber V3 and Yaber V6. At first I purchased the Yaber V3 and that projector is an amazing projector, my favorite actually, but because it was defective with the update, I returned it and bought this Yaber V6. The Yaber customer service is excellent though, and gave me an extra 10% discount for the inconveniences. Thank you Vicky, you are amazing!! Now for the review.<br/><br/>The pros:<br/>The menu is user friendly and has a better interface. At 7500 lumens it is bright enough to see in a fully lit room. The colors are vibrant and more true to reality than other projectors. The speaker levels can be manually adjusted to increase bass, treble, pitch, background, to help with whatever you're using it for which is great! After adjusting levels to my preference, I compared the speakers to my JBL handheld bluetooth speaker and the on Yaber V6 speakers were better! (Which was really surprising). The focus focus ring keeps the focus from the center to the edge of the screen. Even when the 4-point key function isn't adjusted to be a perfect rectangular screen, the picture isn't distorted at all, which is nice.<br/><br/>The cons:<br/>It's large, measuring at 9"x10". It's a little heavy. The height adjuster doesn't help that much because it is so big, so you may need to put a book or object under the front like I did it you aren't using a ceiling mount. It isn't a short throw projector, so in a 10.5 foot room it can only project a 90"x 49" display, compared to the Yaber V3 that can project a 120"x 60" display from the same distance. The fan is loud, but isn't annoying. It sounds like one of those large square floor fans that cost $20 on high speed. When you turn up the volume though it drowns out the noise of the fan. You can't manually adjust the colors. You can adjust brightness, contrast, sharpness, saturation, yet not the red/blue/green colors. It's a tiny flaw that could easily be changed, but it's just a tiny flaw. The picture quality is pretty good, but you need to alter the picture quality to adjust for the pixelation. With the Yaber V3, I hardly needed to adjust the picture quality at all and it was true FHD1080p. The Yaber V6 isn't FHD, but it is probably 1080i. When I play my PS4 games, the quality depreciates dramatically to nearly 720p which is unacceptable. It can only track 30fps (frames per second) and not 60fps so motion is glitchy and detracts from the experience. The Yaber V6 is more expensive that the Yaber V3 with the Yaber costing $210 with a discount, compared to the Yaber V3 that costs $80-$90 with a discount. The quality of the Yaber V6 does not match it's value.<br/><br/>Like I said, I had a phenomenal projector (Yaber V3) before buying this Yaber V6 so this one is the "2nd place brother" in my opinion.<br/><br/>Overall, If I didn't have a better projector to compare this to, I'd think it was a great projector. Honestly, I'd suggest the Yaber V3 over this Yaber V6 any day. You'll save more money and have better picture quality, short throw distance, and versatility in a projector.</span>

<span>This is my second projector. I purchased another one here on Amazon. And I returned it because the keystone was limited and the picture would get blurry on the outside edges of the screen. It also wasn’t as bright and sharp as I wanted. This projector basically resolved all those issues and it was around the same price.<br/><br/>PROS<br/><br/>- 4D Keystone adjustment makes it easy to adjust the screen to the exact size and corners of your screen without getting blurry.<br/><br/>- Projector doesn’t have to be placed in the center. Because of the 4d keystone you can place this projector in a corner and just adjust the keystone to make it a perfect rectangle from an angle.<br/><br/>- The sharpness or picture quality is amazing and HD. There is no blurriness when adjusting the keystone like you find with other projectors.<br/><br/>- Loud speakers. Although I can connect this to my AV receiver using a Bluetooth adapter or wire, the projector internal speakers are extremely loud on their own. You really don’t need any external speakers if you don’t want or have them.<br/><br/>- Easy to set up. I didn’t even bother reading the manual and I was able to figure out how to set up everything.<br/><br/>- Works great with a tv stick like a roku.<br/><br/>- All the ports are on the back so your roku or Amazon stick don’t stick out on the side and look unsightly.<br/><br/>CONS<br/><br/>- The remote isn’t back lit so it’s hard to see what you’re pressing in a dark room.<br/><br/>- The fan is a little loud but eventually you forget it’s there as you’re watching your shows.<br/><br/>- Bluetooth works but there is a slight delay which became annoying. You’re better off using the internal speakers of the projector or using a hardwire.<br/><br/>- I noticed that HBO max and Disney + sound stopped working. I had to change the sound setting of my roku to stereo to resolve it. All the other streaming services seemed to work without having to make that adjustment.<br/><br/>- You won’t be able to properly mirror certain streaming services using your device because they are blocked by those services for projectors. So be sure you get a roku or amazon stick to fix this.<br/><br/>- I wish when you turned the projector turned on it would just default to the last input. But instead you will be brought to the main screen where you need to select the input again. It feels like an extra step that could be fixed with a software update.<br/><br/>All and all I’m happy with this projector. The price is right and the quality is high. I don’t know if I’ll go back to using my 65 inch tv at this point. Lol</span>

<span>I bought this projector to replace another cheaper one from Amazon. The Yaber V6 has greater brightness than the other brand, for only a few dollars more. I used it primarily in my garage which has one normal-sized window behind the projector, and smaller windows built into the garage door. During the day, with daylight shining through the windows, the projected image can be seen on the white-painted brick wall. At night the image is bright and clear. I can't wait to see the image pop when I install my retractable screen.<br/>As for features, the V6 is simple in design. Two HDMI, A/V, and USB input to choose from. The remote is simple lacking dedicated feature buttons like other brands. I mostly use it to power on/off, input selection, and volume control. I use an Amazon Firestick with the V6 and it works flawlessly. The sound volume and clarity are very good for a single speaker unit. The sound stays in sync with the picture, no refresh necessary.<br/>One of the biggest features of the V6 is the four corners digital keystone correction. You can install the projector on an angle then pull or push the corners of the image to the size you want. Very easy to use and adjust. Unlike the cheaper projectors that don't have digital keystone, those you have to place the projector exactly in front of what you are projecting onto. Another reason I returned the cheaper one.<br/>This Yaber V6 has greater illumination as you can see from the photo taken at night in my garage prior to the return of the other projector. The brightness and quality of the image are apparent, even when seen on a brick wall. The left image in the picture is the V6 with a 130"ish projection. Getting closer to the wall you can see the pixels of the V6 are closer together than the cheaper projector. This results in a way better image quality, as you can see. Even though both projectors are 1080p capable, the V6 has a better LCD with less pixel spacing and obviously a brighter image. This brighter LCD does come with a small price of a little more cooling fan noise and heat being pulled. The fan noise is negligible over the program sound.<br/>The V6 has wifi included and I used it to upgrade the firmware. The cheaper projector didn't have the capability.<br/>This projector comes with a nice backpack case which I don't plan on using since I will be hanging the projector from the ceiling. I would've liked to see another accessory instead, maybe batteries for the remote?<br/>This V6 projector from Yaber is a great buy and value for the price when using the promotional coupon. I recommend getting one or gifting one for a large living room, workroom, play room, or even used outdoors at night. For a small bedroom, for example, this might be overkill since you can only reduce the size of the image to 60%</span>

<span>My projector has become old and gotten a brown spot on the screen I reached out to yaber and they sent me a brand new projector. this is the best customer service I've ever gotten and I would highly recommend buying one but based on their customer service.

<span>Been playing around with this thing for a couple months and I can say with all honesty I love it.  Mind you I wasn't expecting a truly high-end projector for the price I paid, so one could say I am just easily impressed since my expectations were not that high to begin with.  But in all fairness this thing works as advertised and meets all of my needs, so I feel I should give credit where credit is due.<br/><br/>Some people have complained about the flimsy build, subpar speakers, short battery life, flimsy tripod and connection problems, but to those I say in order of listed complaints:<br/><br/>1) yes it seems to be cheaply made of plastic, but hey its a projector.  Not something you're supposed to toss up in the air &amp; play catch with while walking down the street.  I advise being careful with it.<br/><br/>2) External speakers are cheap and can be bought with rechargeable batteries, so if you really need better sound you can get a mini powered speaker to carry with you.  I like that it comes with a headphone jack so I can listen to it outdoors in the pool area of my condo complex at night without having to worry about disturbing any neighbors (it's so cool, it's like reliving you drive in movie days from when you were young).<br/><br/>3) Yes the battery life is pretty short and it can be a problem showing full length movies on it.  But short films as well as movie clips or youtube clips or music videos or episodes of TV shows are just fine for this thing.  I use it mostly for anime showings with small groups of friends when we are out instead of having to meet at someones house.  And the fact that it has a built in media player means I don't have to go out and buy a laptop and drag it around with me along with a bunch of cables and whatnot.  This is truly a portable solution for what my needs are.<br/><br/>4) The included tripod seems sturdy enough to me.  True if you're using outdoors on a particularly windy night you might want to keep one finger on one of the legs just to make sure the wind doesn't topple it, but other than that I haven't had any problems with the tripod continually tipping over.<br/><br/>5)  Yes the HDMI port is a mini HDMI, and truth be told I haven't tried to go out a get a cable and tried hooking it up to my Blu-ray player or anything, but the fact that it can run off a simple flash drive is plenty for me.  I have an SD card too but so far haven't even needed to try it as the flash drive option already works great .  A cheap $5 4 gig flash drive will hold more than enough video for an hour or hour &amp; a half showing or presentation, which is all the battery can handle.  And I especially love the fact that as mentioned above I don't have to carry a separate laptop or PC and a bunch of cables &amp; extension cords.  I just whip this out of my shirt pocket and pull out the tripod &amp; a flash drive from one of my other pockets &amp; BOOM...I have an instant set up for a mini showing with friends at most any meeting or private banquet room when I'm out with any special interest group.<br/><br/>Of course the projection quality is not true HD, but unless you're a big videophile or home theater enthusiast you should find the quality pretty good.  Heck it's downright silly to expect the same quality video image from this thing as you get from your multi-thousand dollar home theater system.  I can watch videos with subtitles and read them just fine with this even in just dim light settings (not the greatest choice for a setting with bright lights, but then again that's what the more expensive high end projectors are for).<br/><br/>Most all my friends to whom I've shown this to have all been impressed with it as well and I would highly recommend this for anyone needing a cheap, no frills solution to portable video needs and as an alternative to gathering around a laptop screen every time you want to show something cool.</span>

<span>I bought this projector thinking I didn’t need extra adaptors or cables because it wasn’t mentioned! I have a iPhone 12 Pro Max and I later found out I needed a HDMI CABLE AND a Apple adaptor before I could even use it. I didn’t want to rely on a usb micro chip to store all my pics on, I wants to go from my phone to the projector…..nope not that easy!!!  I thing was mentioned about getting all the stuff till I started to read the reviews on the product, guess I should have done that first 🤦‍♀️ lesson learned. So I’m going to get a “Apple” approved adaptor and if it doesn’t work, it WILL be sent back ASAP!! I’m so frustrated!!<br/><br/>Saturday I went spent another 30.00 on a “Apple” adaptor and it works! So, don’t bother with the after market ones, it won’t work.</span>

<span>I bought it without expecting much, but got more out of it than expected!<br/><br/>I have been busy for a while now with budget LED projectors, and this one by far beats all competitors.<br/>For one, it has a built in video decoding capability!<br/>Two: Extremely low power consumption.<br/>And three, I don't think I should mention portability, battery life, and ease of use, as it may be obvious...<br/><br/>It's very basic Linux one; RM files not included in the decoding, but regular AVI, MKV, MP4, OGV, and other most common containers play back well; as well as audio and image files.<br/><br/>So far I only tested upto 720p video, and it works fine!<br/>Good, because, most my vids are 480p anyway.<br/><br/>The cons of this device:<br/>The projection is rather small, so you'll have to place it quite far away from the wall to get a decent sized screen.<br/>About ~10ft of distance gets you 70in of screen estate; very roughly estimated (I may be off + or - 10").<br/><br/>It's pretty hard to angle the device correctly, and it doesn't have a keystone correct.<br/>Generally I dislike digital keystone correct settings, however it takes only very little to add a small tiltable lens, to get an analog keystone correct.<br/><br/>In a pitch black room you can get a decent 80in screen displaying on a bright white or matte light grey wall.<br/>In the slightest ambient light, the screen size should be reduced to a mere 30in screen max due to image wash out.<br/>In broad daylight (Sun light), the screen can be no bigger than a netbook screen of 10".<br/><br/>So the light intensity is good enough for a dark room, but that's about it!<br/><br/>The speaker is barely 6-9dB louder than the fan, which can be annoyingly loud sometimes for it's size; and especially during silent moments.<br/>They should equip these kind of projectors with curved bladed fans instead of straight fans.<br/>The device is so small, about the size of a remote control, or a bank card; only a bit thicker; that the fan has to be so small, that it needs to rotate full power to keep it cool.<br/><br/>The internal speaker is barely loud enough to be heard in anything bigger than a small bedroom.<br/><br/>In a minor way you can see the rainbow effect when shaking the projector and image a bit.<br/>But when not moving, you won't notice the effect at all (which is, how you usually would watch TV anyway)!<br/><br/>Pro's:<br/>I can literally plug in a 32GB MicroSD card in the device,<br/>plug in speakers or headphones,<br/>and start watching hours of movies.<br/>It's all the device needs. No need for massively large hardware. Just the projector, a USB flash drive plugged in, a micro SD card, or a Google chrome, and your micro projector theater project can all fit in the palm of your hand!<br/><br/>The image quality is very good! I had to add round about 25% of color contrast (from 50%; as stock (50%) the image is somewhat grey-ish), but the colors at 75% contrast look excellent!<br/>Setting it to 80% and it looks somewhat a bit oversaturated.<br/><br/>The resolution is very good as well!<br/>Playing back HD 720p files looks very good! Much better than any DVD player I remember playing back standard DVD's on any TV!<br/><br/>It comes with a tripod stand with flexible legs, but really,<br/>unless you are planning on tilting the projector only in the slightest way, the tripod is pretty useless to me.<br/><br/>My 4yrs old adopted son loves the gadget, and spends countless hours watching his Sponge Bob and Veggie tales episodes on it!<br/><br/>It is cheap, and small. And won't break easily, as it's lightweight, and the plastic housing is adequately strong to prevent the device from breaking from a 5ft fall on a concrete floor.<br/><br/>I usually plug in a micro USB charger cable into it, rated 1500mA, or higher, and the battery hasn't gone dead on me yet.<br/>I heard others say that stock USB power ports do not keep up with the device (stock = 500mA).<br/>I recommend 5V 2000mA or 2500mA ac adapters for continuous playback; if you don't want to drain the battery.<br/>That way the projector can play back from AC, while charging the battery as well.<br/><br/>For a sub 10W projector system, I'd say this is probably your most economic way to watch TV, video, Netflix, and so on.<br/>Oh, BTW, it works well with google chrome (didn't try my Roku on it yet).<br/><br/>Overall I'd say it's an excellent device, perfect for the very dark bedrooms and movie theaters of upto 5 people.<br/>The least bit of ambient light will wash out the picture though.<br/>Great resolution, and best bang for the buck online!<br/><br/>More questions?<br/>Feel free to ask!</span>

<span>This thing is far from perfect, but I’m keeping it anyway.  Hooked up to my Android phone via micro USB to HDMI/MHL it stuttered so badly it was unwatchable (Same setup hooked to my TV works fine).  On my laptop (Micro HDMI)  I didn’t get a picture.  On my Surface Pro (Mini Display Port) I also could not get a picture (although it flickered and tried).  Obviously all these combinations were through a variety of adapters or docks with the only common component being the HDMI to Mini HDMI cable going to the projector itself.  So if you plan on hooking it to something, I’d have a hard time recommending it, although you may have better luck.  Also, the speaker is so poor they may as well have saved themselves the 76 cents worth of parts and left it out.  So why pray tell am I still giving it four stars?  It’s because this cheesy little projector has a micro SD card slot and a full size USB, that coupled with its built in media players make it the coolest little gadget I’ve played with all week (granted it is only Wednesday).  I fished my USB thumb drive out of my pocket and it picked it right up which surprised me since the thumb drive was formatted NTFS.  Anyway, I loaded the thumb drive up with misc. media and plugged it back in to see what it would play, the answer was.. not much. It plays flash files which I thought was amusing, it played QuickTime files without issue which surprised me since Apple doesn't seem to license that much.  It played MKV files, but without sound.  A bunch of cartoon AVI files were hit or miss, it didn't much like the DivX encoded AVI files but liked the XviD ones.  So I grabbed a couple of large XviD movies thinking I had found the holy grail and it choked on those as well.  I seemed to have the best luck with MP4 files so I jumped online to see what the easiest converter tool was.  I snagged “Format Factory” a freebie for PCs and installed it (watch out for the ad-ware it wants to install).  Pointed it at all sorts of different media and told it to output it as “MP4 Medium Quality”.  Loaded the resulting files back on the thumb drive and it plays everything just fine now.  Loaded a micro SD up with some kid friendly fare and now I have a self-contained theater for next time the nieces are in town.  The picture is surprisingly good.  I was a bit skeptical about the reviews, but like others I was pleasantly surprised.  The on-board media player is a bit rudimentary, I’m guessing if I ever get the HDMI portion working the picture will be even better. The sound is abysmal but the audio out jack works fine.  I have a JBL Micro Speaker (available here on Amazon) that I use with my cell phone, it works great on this projector as well.  I plugged the projector into one of those USB battery packs and it keeps it running well past the 80 minutes advertised so it must charge on the fly.  All this mentioned gear, plus the included tripod fits in a medium sized camera bag.  For a geek that likes playing with new toys, it’s pretty hard to beat this for just over a C-Note.  I have some additional cables/adapters on order.  If I find a combination where the HDMI works for me, I’ll update this.  Sorry for the run on sentences and plethora of acronyms, but I figured there may be someone else out there on the verge of sticking it back in the box and returning it (like I was).  Keep playing with it, you may also find a combination that works for you.</span>

<span>I wasn't expecting much for a mini projector under $75, but I'll admit I'm impressed. The wireless streaming feature works very reliably without any hassle or complicated setup. This is definitely not an outdoor projector and should not be advertised as such. But in a very dark room it has a pretty decent picture. There's no way to adjust the size of the picture as far as I can tell, other than moving the position of the projector back and forth, so keep that in mind. It might be better to throw on a white wall instead of trying to make a perfect fit on a screen.</span>

<span>I love that it’s compact and easy to store, the picture quality is great once put into focus. However, it struggles with connecting to my devices via wireless screen sharing/airplay, which is really a downer but I guess that’s what I get for the price I paid 😅 overall it’s nice to have, I’ll try wired connections, maybe I’ll get lucky there</span>

<span>For a simple, inexpensive projector this isn't too bad. Don't expect great sharpness and/or rich colors, but it does whatever it needs to. I had some issues with my unit but I'm not sure if they were the result of manufacturing or shipping: part of the lens was pushed in, so the image would be warped on one side and it would smell of burning plastic almost immediately after being turned on.</span>

<span>I have a Samsung Galaxy s9. I put the EZcast app onto my phone. Then I had to turn off my wifi in order to use the USB tethering that allowed me to see images from my phone on the projected screen. Using my mobile data to watch a movie isn't cool. Then once I gained access to the EZcast app, every time I tried to look at anything else other than the home movies on my phone, it would kick me off of the EZcast connect and I would have to connect again. Some people said that you can watch Netflix, Vudu, and Amazon using their smart phones and the USB but this wasn't the case for me. Not being able to use my wifi at the same time as the USB tethering was the biggest turnoff followed closely by kicking kicked off of the tethering every time that I tried to go anywhere else but the contents of my own phones files. Now I am not the most tech savvy human on the face of this planet but I really think that something as simple as hooking up your phone to a projector and being able to watch movies that I have already purchased through Vudu and the such should be really that....simple but this was not. Also, when my daughter was trying to have a slide show at her birthday party, we couldn't get it to understand any device that we plugged in until we pulled out a laptop. Then when we finally got the slide show to function there wasn't any sound so that had to be played through the lap top as well. Very annoying. Then we got out our blu ray player and connected it through the HDMI cable without success. We had picture but not sound. Someone show me to a projector that let's me plug in my phone, use my WIFI, and let me watch the movies that I have already purchased. Please. (PS. I know that I am repeating myself but this is just so danged frustrating.)</span>

<span>Update:  I purchased an Apple adapter to try before sending back and it worked with the HDMI cord provided.  My son is able to play Netflix now.  Unfortunately, Apple’s adapter is $54 vs 3rd party less then $20.<br/><br/>1st Review:  It is what is is, a cheap little projector.  Purchased for son to give as gift and while testing to make sure it worked, we figured we could not get it to work with lightening to hdmi to play netflix from phone.  Tried a HDCP cord and still no luck.  It would play amazon video, youtubetv but no Netflix.  If  you don’t think you will ever use with an iPhone to play Netflix, it is not a bad little cheap projector.  Sound is nothing special, maybe try Bluetooth speaker with your phone.</span>

<span>This little tiny projector is absolutely perfect for camping.  I was skeptical that a projector at this price point would have a decent picture but the picture is good, it is SUPER compact and with an apple to HDMI adapter, it could not be simpler to play movies from my iphone.  We also have a huge outdoor movie set up for more elaborate backyard movie parties....speakers, 15 ft screen and all the wiring that goes with it.  This is sooo much easier...I love it!  Bang for your buck and convenience, this was a solid purchase for my camping arsenal.  I read some reviews where users were upset that it didn't come with different cables they needed and complained about getting it to play on different devices.  It works as it's intended to work and you're buying a projector...not an electronics and cable all-you-can-eat buffet.  Do your research on specs and buy any necessary cables to work with your devices of choice and you'll be golden.</span>

<span>This projects a pretty dark image.  EVen in a blackout room.  That's all there is to it.  Not bright enough.  It also is not very clear all.  EVen when you "focus wheel" it in, and at a 40 inch screen you cannot read anything from you Window's screen.  You can read subtitles if you have the screen large enough and dialed in.  It also doesn't have anyway to square the screen.  So you better be able to mount it perfectlt straight line.  Also, the colors are just weird.  Its like they tried to overcompensate for the lack of brightness by making colors to strong.  A sceen that has a slighly blue tint (like a dark movie sceen) will be 100% dark blue with black shadows - nothing more.  Same with all the colors, red, yellow everything is over compensated.  Now, can you watch a movie on it?  Sure, it just looks dull.  The problem is that you can pick up a cheap TV now for very little and even the cheapest TV will have a much better quality presentation.  So, this was a fail for me.</span>
