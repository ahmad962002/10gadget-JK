<span>So far looks like a real good product it comes with a remote control which is great but I don't like the other box that it comes with because you cannot remove it if you do not want to use it takes up room but installs very easy I used one of the packing material that it came with as a template for my drywall screws stuck two screws in that measured it with the existing screen screwed it right up in about 3 minutes and installed my screen easy to install</span>

<span>This projector screen is hanging from my ceiling and works perfectly whether I am using the remote control or the attached controller. The remote control comes with a plastic sleeve and screws, so I attached it to my headboard so I can easily push the button and lower and raise the screen. The picture quality is projected nicely and clearly. I can also easily remove the projector from the 2 hooks I am hanging it from and move it to a different room. I have hooks hanging in 3 rooms, so I can move it around depending on the occasion, such as putting it in the living room when I have friends over. I put it in my guest bedroom to entertain my family's kids when they come visit. I do wish I had gotten one just a little bit wider, but that is just a personal preference. My projector is 7 feet away and it fits perfectly onto the screen. If I were to go back further it would be too wide for this particular screen.</span>

<span>I JUST took this out of the box. My initial impressions:<br/><br/>Perfect.  It's exactly what I need.  I have the 50" model.  It's about 44" long closed. It weighs nothing. It'll be [almost] perfect for my travelling sales job, where I give presentations to prospective partners on a regular basis.<br/><br/>Pros:<br/>1. Lightweight<br/>2. Compact<br/>3. Nice size that will easily pack into my work car (an Impreza) without sticking out or being cumbersome in any way.<br/>4. You can open it part-way; no need to open it all the way if you don't want to.<br/><br/>Cons:<br/>1. It will need to sit on a table.  It would be nice if I could park it on the floor and raise it to viewable height. It would require about 20" of black "screen" be added to the bottom.<br/>2. I tried to see if I could park it on a stool (a perfectly flat/level surface) with the ends hanging off, and have it balance itself on the center lock lever/"leg" in the rear. It will *kinda* do it, but it wants to fall forward. It would be great if there were a couple of molded-in flat spots in the center to prop it up if it has to hang off an edge somewhere. I'll need to buy a portable table for this just in case my client destinations have no such thing available.<br/><br/>All in all, it is perfect for what I need it to do - although a simple alteration (or two) to the design would be worth paying an extra $15 for. The lightweight/compact qualities also might make it &lt;seem&gt; a little bit "cheap". Whether or not it actually is cheap will be determined by how it holds up for me on the road.  Bear in mind, at the end of the day the unit was a grand total of fifty bucks, shipped. I'll be happy if this thing holds up to 20 uses at that price.<br/><br/>Conclusion: At the outset, I'm impressed.  I'll update this review if anything goes terribly wrong.</span>

<span>I love this projector screen! I bought it for my daughters play room and it’s perfect. It was easy to hang (I just hung it on a screw that was already in the wall from a picture frame), and it stretches perfectly.<br/><br/>My favorite part it how portable it is. I can literally take it down, roll it up and it takes up no room at all. This is a way better option than mounting a tv.<br/><br/>Overall, I definitely recommend!</span>

<blockquote><em><div class="a-row a-spacing-small review-data"><span class="a-size-base review-text review-text-content" data-hook="review-body">
<span>I bought this screen because I was speaking in a small venue without projection equipment. I used a small projector and an iPad to run the on-screen presentation. The screen fit perfectly in a mail tube that I bought at Office Depot. All in all, it was a great system, and it got the job done in a fairly bright room.<br/><br/>I was able to place the screen on an easel, which the venue already had. If I were placing this screen on a table, I would use a clamp on the foot to keep it from tipping. The foot is narrow, but that makes it more portable. A clamp is a solution that is cheap and easily available.<br/><br/>For the money, this is a great screen. It raises and lowers very easily, and it is bright. It is light and small. We often travel to stay in a cabin over the Christmas holidays. This year, I will take this screen, along with the small projector, and we will be set for "movie night."</span>

<span>PRODUCT VERSION REVIEWED<br/><br/>ELITE SCREENS MANUAL B 100-INCH MANUAL PULL DOWN PROJECTOR SCREEN DIAGONAL 16:9 DIAG 4K 8K 3D ULTRA HDR HD READY HOME THEATER MOVIE THEATRE WHITE PROJECTION SCREEN WITH SLOW RETRACT MECHANISM M100H<br/><br/>QUICK REVIEW: [TL;DR]<br/>HIGH QUALITY – VERY AFFORDABLE MOVIE SCREEN – NO FRILLS NEEDED – EASY SETUP<br/><br/>FULL REVIEW:<br/>ELITE SCREENS MANUAL B- M100H was exactly what I needed.  I was going nuts looking at every projector screen on Amazon and other sites (for several months), and kept working my way up to $500-$1000 automatic screens.  I finally took a step back, and thought about what I really needed / wanted.<br/><br/>MY NEEDS:<br/>- Simple, idiot proof operation, for myself and guests<br/>- No hunting around for remotes<br/>- Lightweight for easy 1 person installation<br/>- Black Background for light blocking from background devices<br/>- High Reflection Rate (but not too bright)<br/>- 100 inch overall diagonal size<br/>- Something good enough for my 1080p / 3D projector<br/>- Attractive enough for my unfinished basement / rec. room<br/>- Nothing so expensive that I will get upset when my rowdy nephews break it<br/>- A good upgrade from a stretch fabric screen (that my nephews already got pool table chalk on)<br/><br/>UNFOUNDED CONCERNS FROM OTHER REVIEWS:<br/>- Well packaged, no dents in boxes or case<br/>- No Strong Odor<br/>- No Wrinkle in the Screen<br/><br/>SETUP:<br/>In my case, my basement is unfinished so I wanted the screen mostly tucked out of the way into rafters/ceiling joists.  My ceiling is also on the lower side, so it was easy to hang / install myself.  I ended getting some adjusting projector hanging brackets ($14) to make it a little easier to level.  I also needed to mount the screen between the joists so I needed the brackets to move the project away from the wall.  I have a 65” TV for everyday TV and Gaming.  I needed the screen far enough out so that I could pull it down in front of the TV when I want a more immersive experience.<br/><br/>TIPS:<br/>Maybe it goes without saying, but I was very careful to make sure the screen was as level as I could get it, and perfectly square with my projector and the wall behind.  This way it stays in focus across the entire screen.  I also had to move my projector to make sure it was centered on the screen.<br/><br/>IMPRESSIONS (so far):<br/>I LOVE IT.  MY WIFE LOVES IT.  MY SON LOVES IT.  We have already elevated our family movie nights, and I’m loving watching NFL Playoff games on a 100 inch screen while I write this review.<br/><br/>It has met or exceeded my expectations on every level.  I could not be happier with this purchase.<br/><br/>RECOMMENDATION:<br/><br/>Skip all the bells and whistles of other screens, get something that works right every time.  Stop making yourself crazy and just get this screen.</span>

<span><br/><br/>I purchased this screen three weeks ago and so far I must say I like it quite well. I purchased it to replace my original 100" DIY screen which I had constructed from some instructions I found on a popular projector review site; it consisted of a wood frame covered in black felt with white seamless background paper (used in photography) stapled to the back. It did me well for six years or so, but unfortunately over time the paper sagged and developed large wrinkles which caused some distortion and "waving" of the image, especially during static scenes and scrolling film credits. I have some of the background paper left over so I could have replaced it, but instead I thought I should look at a better solution.<br/><br/>I purchased Elite Screens model M106UWH which is a 106 inch 16:9 AR manual projection screen.  Before I made the purchase I read many reviews, both positive and negative on many of Elite Screen's products.  Most of the negative reviews had to do with problems with the retraction mechanism jamming or breaking. Since there were far more positive than negative reviews, I figured I'd give it a try.  I paid $125 for it including my state sales tax and since it was Prime eligible, I didn't pay anything for shipping.  When it arrived the box had a couple holes in it and a few serious dents and I was certain the screen had been damaged during shipping, but on inspection there was a enough spacing with the foam packing spacers that it was fine.<br/><br/>Pros:  I  was surprised to find the main housing was metal; for the price I thought it would be plastic.<br/><br/>I have found the retraction mechanism to be very smooth; I had no problem pulling down the screen, locking it into several positions, and then releasing and having it retract. So far the mechanism seems pretty solid.  Since I'm going to be leaving my screen down this isn't a big deal to me, but having read many other customer reviews it's important to a lot of other purchasers.<br/><br/>The contrast and overall sharpness are better than my original screen.  It's not a huge difference, but enough to be noticeable. I think it is a bit more neutral in color balance as well. It is also a bit brighter, but that wasn't really an issue since my home theatre is in a darkened basement; I have to turn DOWN the brightness a bit to get the image adjusted correctly.<br/><br/>Cons:  The included documentation is terrible! It consisted of a Screen Material Disclaimer sheet, which told me about "memory lines", a 'Universal Projector Mount' rebate form, an 'In-Wall Switch Rebate' form, an 'Elite Screens' brochure AND a single sheet about the 'On-Line User Guide or Download'.  Since the User Guide is all of eight pages, and the Dimension sheet just a single page, would it have been that difficult to include?  Evidently  so; you'll have to go to their website to get that info.<br/><br/>While the Dimension Table sheet is quite extensive in giving you just about every measurement you could want or need about their product, to me there were three major problems:<br/><br/> 1) The most important dimension, the distance between the wall mounting holes on the end caps was not even included! The measurement you need to determine where you are going to put the screws in your wall so you can mount the screen doesn't exist; you'll have to measure (or calculate) that yourself.<br/> 2) The Dimensions Table is in Decimal and not Fractional inches. Excuse me? The vast majority of us that have a tape measure don't have one that is graduated in tenths and hundredths of inches; I know they are available but most people don't own one.<br/> 3) The end cap measurements on the Dimension Table sheet are in Metric and not US/Imperial  measurements - even more math that will have to be done to get mounting screws aligned correctly.<br/><br/>Installing it by myself was a little bit of a challenge; after I measured the placement of the drywall anchor screws (see the Cons) and installed them, it took a bit of effort to lift and align the screen with the screws to attach it to the wall.  Even though the screen weighs only 21 pounds, lifting that above your head and trying to get two small holes on either side of the housing to line up with the anchor screws in the wall is difficult.  I managed it after a few tries, but I'd recommend having someone else handy  to assist you mounting the screen.<br/><br/>Overall I'm very happy with this screen and I have no problem recommending it.  The edge curls and "waves" others have complained about with the various models of the Elite Screens I have not experienced with mine.  Also the smell others have complained about in other reviews I have not experienced.  Initially there was a smell similar to a vinyl window shade, but it dissipated within a day, so I can't complain.</span>

<span>We bought the 150" manual pull down screen, and I tell ya, it checks all our boxes. So far so good. We've been using it about a month, pulling it up and down with no issues. Not perfectly flat on the edges (they curl a bit, but that was to be expected, not noticeable when watching.  Ours has a little alignment issue, but again... I think we get what we pay for with the screen.<br/><br/>Not great in daylight environments, but again not it's intended purpose, and it still works, just not as good as at night. :-)<br/><br/>overall very happy and looks great with our 4k projector</span>

<span>I am using this screen with 11 feet viewing distance. The first one i got had a visible line at the bottom. Called Amazon support and they helped to return and replace with a new one. This one was packaged well and the screen is near perfect with no noticeable wrinkles or scratches. Enjoying the screen so far and hopefully it works like this rest of it's life.</span>

This is almost a 5 stars for me but if you are picky and are into cinematic experience you probably need to spend $700 in a professional screen, otherwise for ocasional view this is a great value for the money.</span>
