<span>I travel to many different churches and senior homes for ministry work, and do video presentations in my music programs. Because every building has different types of lighting, I needed a projector that was EXTREMELY bright to work in all lighting situations.<br/><br/>And WOW, is the Ben Q MH760 ever BRIGHT! It’s default settings start off quite quite bright, but I love how there are so many different customizable options in this projector to make it even brighter. Multiple lamp modes, along with adjustable brightness, color, and contrast settings allow you to keep making the picture brighter while choosing what you want to trade off in the brightest of rooms. It even works well with a tremendous amount of outside ambient light coming in through windows.<br/><br/>This is my third projector, unquestionably the best one I have ever used, or have ever see anyone else use. I’m 100% satisfied!</span>

<span>Great projector.  Stay away from the cheaper models.  I’ve tried a few and none lived up to watch the preached.  This is great we use it for outdoor movies.  Picture is clear and onboard audio is ok.  Purchasing a speaker to help boost that.  I use my iPhone which plugs in to the projector and plays what ever I want.  I haven't played around with other settings but this does not do Bluetooth or wireless streaming which I thought was ok as all the other's claimed they did but didn’t.  Would suggest for anyone looking for a side projector to do small moves gear and there.</span>

<span>Our trusty Epson PowerLite 3010 projector died after almost 10 years of heavy use. Since we'll be moving to another house within a year and don't know what kind of space we'll have there for a home theater, we decided to the get the least-expensive decently rated projector we could find. The Epson Home Cinema 880 at $600 seems to be the entry-level equivalent of the 3010, which was $1,400 in 2012 (which was a bargain then). My five-star rating is based on the value for the price and isn't meant to compare it with more-expensive projectors.<br/><br/>First, the 880 is a lot smaller and lighter than the 3010. The team that installed the 3010 used a universal ceiling mount, so swapping out the projectors was easy. The 3010 was attached by four bolts, whereas the 880 uses three. If you're replacing a projector, make sure your existing mount will work.<br/><br/>The zoom range is much longer on the 880. We have a 120" projection screen, which is about 12' from the projector. At that distance, the maximum image size of the 3010 was 120". When I turned on the 880, the image would have covered a 150" screen. It took me a while to adjust the zoom and keystoning, but I eventually got it right.<br/><br/>The 880's fan seems slightly louder than the 3010's. I've gotten used to it, but I was aware of it for the first couple weeks, whereas I don't recall being aware of the 3010's fan unless nothing was playing on the speakers. Projector mode is set to ECO, which I read makes the fan quieter.<br/><br/>The 880's brightness is 3300 lumens, whereas the 3010's was 2200. Here's the catch: In Bright Cinema mode, the image is easily viewable in a well-lit room, even during the day with the curtains open. However, the fan is EXTREMELY loud -- almost as loud as our microwave oven. It's unusable for us. In regular Cinema mode, the brightness seems comparable to the 3010's brightness -- beautiful in a darkened room, but washed out in a fully lit room.<br/><br/>The color is gorgeous. I think the image is sharper than the 3010's. At a 12' viewing distance, I can see the pixels, but it's not so much as to be distracting. I couldn't see the pixels on the 3010.<br/><br/>The 880 doesn't do 3D, if that's a concern for you. We have a handful of 3D Blu-ray Discs, including a couple of spectacular ones like Avatar. Moving up to to a 3D projector would have added several hundred dollars to the price, which wasn't in our budget. That also would have gotten us a 4K projector (the 880 is 1080P), but our system is wired with HDMI 1.4 cabling, which doesn't support 4K.<br/><br/>In short, the 880 is a solid choice if you're looking for a low-priced projector. In our next house, we'll probably upgrade to a 4K projector that includes 3D, and of course we'll need to have our system wired with HDMI 2.1 cabling.</span>

<span> We had an Optoma HD20 for 7 years that finally stopped working. We use our theater room every night and love it so I decided to stay with Optoma since our last one worked so well. Things I love about the new one HD28HDR (1) the projector now has sound and that’s a nice addition. (2) Fan noise is almost nothing compared to our HD20 (3) Has 4K to work with our Roku Ultra (4) Picture is even better great contrast and incredible sharpness. it’s just beautiful we have a 100 inch screen and it’s just awesome!<br/><br/>Update****So I had my first problem with this unit and it's not even a year old I did get an extended warranty but my unit is still under manufactures warranty so I had to talk to Optoma on the phone my unit started for no reason going to a blank screen it would still have the sound but no picture the power button turned red and the lamp indicator was flashing red. The Tech on the phone said well that sounds like a lamp failure. ( Total Hours on lamp 300 and in eco mode) it's rated for 15,000 in eco and 4000 if not so no reason to be having a bulb failure. He said you should unseat the bulb and reseat it I said I would but I see no directions for this and the sticker on the side says it voids the warranty. He said no it doesn't and I'm sure it says how to replace the bulb so he looked it up only to see I was correct the directions say nothing about bulb replacement. Then he said well maybe the company only wants our Tech's doing it on this unit.....( I replaced my bulb on my old one 2 times super easy) So I definitely would not have purchased this if I knew I would have to mail it in or bring to them to do a simple bulb replacement. So he told me to use direction for another unit that has the same set up to open and reseat the bulb. He said don't worry it won't void the warranty if that doesn't work send it in to us.  I inspected it and it still very clean and mine hangs from a mount so it never gets moved around no signs of any dust build up which is the usually enemy of these units. So now I have to decide if I want to take it apart reseat the bulb or mail it into them. If I knew that this unit may not have been made so the owner can replace the bulb I definitely would have purchased something else and I would probably now say that to anyone looking at it for the simple fact bulbs break and blow and it always seems to happen at the worst time like the day before the Super Bowl (yes I had that happen) also why I like to keep a spare one. I would even give serious consideration to a unit that has no bulbs if your in the market they cost more but in the long run you may be happy you spent the extra money because if every time this one breaks if I have to mail it in and wait to get it back I will not be happy customer.<br/><br/>Update #2 Optoma has had this unit for 1 month I had to keep emailing them asking when will we get it back? Finally yesterday they emailed me saying it’s a bulb failure but they don’t have any bulbs right now and don’t expect any until September. So now I am looking at 2 1/2 months with no projector. I emailed them and offered to buy a better model if they would credited me for the cost of this one just let me upgrade and get my theater room back up and running and I was told no my only option is to wait on the part. DO NOT BUY! Also if shopping for a projector know this Optoma has one repair center in the USA it’s in California so to ship this to them was around $60 since I am on they east coast.<br/><br/>Update October 3,2021 So we just received our unit back today from it's failure that started in the middle of June so around 3 1/2  months to get it back and $60 in shipping. It's been fully tested and they replaced the bulb. For those who may need one here is the part number SP7G901GC01 It's cost is around $150 mine was covered under the warranty. I also have an extended one so now I have to determine if I should keep this or sell it. Since we use our theater room every night we purchased a new LED projector that we really love and as I mentioned before with the delays in factories and parts over the last 2 years you may also want to consider LED as they have no lamps to go bad and have much longer life spans 10-15 years but they do cost more or consider getting a spare bulb immediately as you will need one at some point.</span>

<span>I bought this unit to replace the HD 26 that I bought in 2016. That was a very good projector I had purchased a new bulb for it and very recently the color went out on it and it was only in black-and-white. The funny thing is when I was reading the reviews for this one the remote control only had 3 1/2 stars but on the HD 26 it has five stars after unboxing I compared the two and they are the exact same. I haven’t heard mounted to the ceiling in the place of where the HD 26 was about 15 feet from the screen I am at the max and there is no adjustment for focus. Where the HD 26 had a zoom in and zoom out as well as focus and fine-tune</span>

<span>Husband and I bought this to replace a similar Optoma DLP projector that we had for ~6 years. For the same price point now, this one is way brighter. We used to have to wait until dark to see anything properly on a projector, but this one is still super clear in the middle of the day (barring direct sunlight of course). That aspect alone is worth the upgrade for us, because we can get way more use out of it. The picture is very good; colors are bright and accurate. I also love the focus knob; since it's so big, it offers very fine control and it's easy to get it focused perfectly.<br/><br/>The only cons I have are small: (1) It takes a really long time to turn on and switch inputs compared to other projectors I've had. Not a big deal, just a little annoying. (2) No dust filter! I don't know why Optoma doesn't think dust filters are necessary. Apparently they only include them in "dusty climates," whatever that means. Without one, dust will collect in the projector and make it more likely to overheat and have parts break down (that's what happened to our last one multiple times). If you are tech savvy enough, you can open the projector up every so often and vacuum the dust out to make sure the projector lasts a long time. Also just make sure you place it in a well-ventilated spot / not right up against a wall and definitely not in an enclosed space like a cubby shelf. Don't just rely on the projector telling you when it's too hot, something could be damaged or starting to melt a little before the built-in sensors go off.<br/><br/>For future reference, if something does go wrong, don't be afraid to fix it yourself. The most common issue I've had with DLP projectors is a bad color wheel. If your colors start flashing weirdly and you hear whirring/clicking from the projector, it's probably the color wheel. You can get a new one online for &lt;$30 and replace it yourself. Just look up a video.</span>

<span> I've had this projector for over 6 months now, so I think my review is pretty objective. I LOVE this projector!! Read below for more.<br/><br/>My Setup<br/><br/>I set up this projector in my very bright living room. I have 5 7-foot windows perpendicular to my screen, so we get lots of natural sunlight during the days here in Texas. Even with that, the picture is quite clear and not washed out, at least IMO(first two pics).<br/><br/>I paired this projector with a CineGrey screen. I highly recommend using the light absorbing screen material if using in a bright room. It really helps with daytime picture quality. I think I spent another $120 for the CineGrey.<br/><br/>The next two pictures and video are with my window shutters closed to block out as much light as possible. You can see a marked improvement in picture quality. However, this projector really shines at night or in darkness. It's theater quality and a bright, crisp picture.<br/><br/>Pros<br/><br/>1. Bright picture, even during the day.<br/>2. The sound is quite clear, especially if sitting below or near it. I have a sound system, so that feature is muted on mine. But during initial install I did test that out.<br/>3. Lightweight...easy to handle.<br/><br/>Cons<br/><br/>1. Ceiling mount options are limited. I purchased a universal mount and had to shimmy it to make it work.<br/>2. Limited keyhole adjustment. I spent too much time trying to get it perfect.<br/><br/>My overall advice for anyone thinking about using a projector in living rooms or bright rooms is to get the highest lumen projector over 3000lm you can afford. Obviously 4k projectors are better, but you can't beat this for a 1080p.</span>

<span>Purchased may 2021, and a week ago the projector died on me. Doesnt want to power up, at first I thought it could be the bulb. But read that it has an indicator for the bulb replacement. It still should power up but with out an image. Check cord, check receptacle, it simply wont power up. Warranty is 1yr I figured. 1yr and 3months its gone. Cant complain of image quality cuase was great but maybe more quality in internals could really help for years of service. Sorry Viewsonic but I move to another brand.</span>

<span>The instruction manual is really brief.  Most functions are self explanatory but I could not get the #$*% wake on hdmi signal to work.  I had the wake on hdmi option to on and set power off timer to 10 minutes (which is correct).  Finally realized that when the projector shuts down it cools for about a minute and the green power light flashes repeatedly while it's cooling.  When the light finally goes off THEN the projector will wake up when it receives an hdmi signal.<br/><br/>Great picture, put it in gamer mode and tried some eldon ring and there's not really any perceptible lag at all, I'm impressed.</span>

<span>I waited for a while to pull the trigger on a 4k projector - 1080p on a 200" screen just wasn't cutting it anymore. I got tired of being able to see the scan lines, plus my old projector was only like 600 lumens so it only worked in basically total darkness.<br/><br/>This projector is a quantum leap from that 1080p machine. I've been in this game a very long time. I used to refurbish 3-gun CRT projectors back in the day because despite being big, clunky, and maintenance-heavy, they put out the absolute best picture money could buy back then.<br/><br/>Soon LED and DLP technology got better and better and it just didn't make sense to have a 300 pound projector built into a coffee table anymore whenever something that weighs less than a pound can put out a picture that's nearly as good.<br/><br/>So there we have it - it's taken technology thirty years to finally catch up to the 4k analog days of CRT projectors, but boy have they ever and in a huge way. This projector is a bargain and it blows away anything else I've ever owned. The brightness levels are insane - actually a little too much - I recommend using Dynamic Eco Mode as it is still plenty bright and will increase lamp life dramatically.<br/><br/>The picture that this thing puts out is outstanding. Do I wish the keystone controls were a little better or that the optical zoom was better so that I didn't have to relocate my projector to the back of the room? Sure I do, but projectors that do that cost twice as much and don't put out a much better picture.<br/><br/>This thing is absolutely the best bang for the buck out there in home theater right now. My only real complaint is that sometimes on white lettering I can see the chromatic aberration "rainbow effect," but it doesn't happen a lot and I've learned to ignore it.<br/><br/>If you're on the fence and have a large enough room to support the long throw on this projector, I wouldn't hesitate a bit.</span>

<span>We recently purchased this projector for outdoor summer movie nights.  I bought the projector because it allows direct use of a DVD (versus hooking up to a separate machine).

For the price, it is an excellent machine.  My one complaint is that it is not compatible with Blueray discs.</span>

<span>I’ve had this projector for 11 months and I have had time to “get to know it” pretty well in that time. I give it a solid “C+” and my score includes features, price, functionality, and quality.<br/><br/>Features<br/>- it’s got a “gaming mode” which is the only way to get the ultra low latency which drops your resolution to 1080. So it’s 4K gaming at high latency or low latency at 1080, not low latency at 4K. This was not clear to me at the time of purchase.<br/><br/>- also with gaming mode, it removes any screen adjustments you make. So if you have some digital zoom or keystoning going on, forget about it. You’ll be gaming at an odd angle.<br/><br/>- brilliant colors are also pretty useless as I have found, they tend to just put a halo around things or blow out certain colors. A prime example is if I’m watching a video of someone and the sky is in the background, it puts a while halo around the person. With brilliant color turned off, it goes away. So I keep that at as low as it goes.<br/><br/>Let’s talk fire. If a scene has a fire in it or a red, to yellow, to white gradient, it’ll blow it out and you get this odd effect where it looks glowing. I can fix it by changing the color gamut and temperature and putting the brilliant color to 6, but then I get the halo on blues. So I can’t balance it. It works for one but is broken for another.<br/><br/>Picture<br/>It does get a great picture at times, it does better with certain scenarios over others.<br/><br/>It does seem a bit dark at times. I have to up the brightness is some situations and I have found that with how an appletv processes an image, a dark movie is just about unwatchable.<br/><br/>Unless the room is pitch black, you won’t enjoy it. I bought a mid level screen and unless it’s totally dark in the room, you won’t see details in dark scenes.<br/><br/>Functionality<br/>It is a bit loud. Granted, my projector is over head and I’m about 5 feet from it. Not a huge problem but adds to my list.<br/><br/>Finding a source between switching from non-hdr to hdr content takes a bit. Maybe 10-15 seconds? It’s just annoying to turn an app on and then wait 15 seconds. Or if you watch a trailer, it’ll kick in to hdr mode. That’s annoying.<br/><br/>The remote works well and the UI, while functionally fine does feel dated. I’m 2020 I bought a state of the art projector and it feels like a UI from the 90’s.<br/><br/>There are no smart capabilities with the projector. I am ok with this, but it’s worth noting.<br/><br/>Quality<br/>This is where I am the harshest on this projector. I got this because I was told I pad lens shift. The lens shift is a joke. It’s a single direction and the range of motion is hardly noticeable.<br/><br/>Recently, and what brought me back to do this review is I have dead pixels. White dots on the screen that are always present. Also, if I do the full white screen test pattern, I have black pixels as well. I presume these black pixels will turn into white pixels at some point, but I am 3,000 hours into it and to have dead pixel is no good for me. I’ll be sending it back in the hopes that I get a refund and can buy something else. For what I paid, it’s just not a quality product.<br/><br/>I would not buy this projector again and I would suggest others do the same. It hits on a small handful of things but misses on many many more.</span>

<span>review with updates over course of a year.<br/>But basically I love it, and it works out the box, but also has plenty of room to tinker the picture to your liking.<br/><br/>Day 1:  I opened up the box and plugged it in, just power and hdmi. Aimed it at the wall. It took a few seconds to warm up and then, even in broad daylight with no curtains, on pukey apartment tan/gray/green paint, there was vivid color and bright whites and a perfectly legible 9 foot playstation screen. This just feels magical. I adjusted the keystone to undo the distortion from the angle I had it at, played with the focus and zoom for a few seconds, and started playing some games. Even without extended game mode it was responsive enough to play some resogun, so I turned game mode on (not just the color setting, the low lag) to try it out. The keystone undoes, so my quick setup ran the top of the screen into the ceiling, but it was so smooth, so pretty, so big. Like I feel like a kid and this is magical watching black screens look like wall then in slides a logo or loading screen and then it's a game on my wall. Is it a little washed out in daytime? Yeah, the blacks aren't super deep around noon, but perfectly watchable even if you don't close the curtains, and your eyes adjust better than it can look in a photo to make the blacks look black next to the amazing whites. Is it amazing in the dark? Yes. Even after around 4pm with no curtains, when you don't even need a room light on yet, blacks look deep black next to the brights and everything is rich. Is it magical? Always. Is it good for gaming? Yes. I am very very impressed. Been gaming for decades and I never want to use a tv again, the brightness on this and the size make a rich deep picture with a wow factor even just on an off-color wall with no prep. I bought a sound system in expectation that the built in speaker would suck, but it's about on par with decent tv speakers and serviceable. Great volume actually, I have yet to turn it above 3. I got this to treat myself and holy **** it's amazing. Highly recommend. Just do it. It weighs so much less than a tv and is so magical. Great color and brightness and good for gaming and watching Netflix or whatever. I am so excited to play everything on this I feel like I just bought a second childhood. It has no business looking so good in the daytime.<br/><br/>Considerations after a few weeks: use "game" or "hdr sim" in daytime, it blows out the whites but the contrast and brightness is so much better. The dynamic brightness is supposed to give you 15,000 hours of life, that's like 10 years of 4 hours a day, but you can hear the fan speed change, and the brightness ramp up can be noticeable and distracting when brightness changes on screen back and forth: not usually noticeable on games, but on some shows where dialogue cuts back and forth. If you want 240hz and atmos, good luck. You would need the right dual outputs on your pc to go straight to the projector and av receiver, as the projector only has stereo out, and I don't think there is an a receiver or splitter on the market that can do 1080p240hz, best I can get is 1080p120hz or 4k60hz, which is still exceptional. Those considerations said, I still highly recommend this, it's amazing.<br/><br/>After a few months: still loving it. I think the only complaint is that on dynamic brightness the whites get crushed a bit on hdr from my PS4, this can probably be solved by switching to the non dynamic bright mode. On hdr in general, the dynamic black ramping will occasionally create banding and white blowout on transitions of dark to bright content too, the response time of the lamp and pixels seem to differ, this could probably be solved in a firmware update. Still highly recommend. It's a 4k60,1080p240hz projector with gaming speed and insanely good brightness and color. Nitpicking aside nothing compares to this. Pair with a surround or Atmos sound system and it's a perfect home theater.<br/><br/>1 year update: still loving it and highly recommend it. I run my PC at 1080p120hz for movies upscaled with svp, and PS5 at 4k60. I stopped using HDR because the picture looks better without it, as it crushes whites and blacks on dynamic brightness mode. Overall the only downside is that around noon the picture is washed out, and you need to either pump the contrast up to about 30, or close the curtains. Best display I've ever used, don't even need game mode it's not laggy.  Possibly the best purchase I've ever made.<br/><br/>I eventually found the setting that was blowing out the whites in dynamic brightness mode, in the image settings screen scroll, to the second page and there's some trademark sounding color menu like tru color or vibrant color or something, it's basically a second contrast scaler. I still usually leave it on the default setting for the brightness boost for a clearer image with lights on, but if you're doing movie night with the lights off, setting it lower will give you a better reference image, which of course there's an image preset for anyway.</span>

<span>TLDR:<br/>Low Quality Projector - Stay away if you want a 4K projector with low input lag - Keep Looking or Save your Money<br/>Gamers : Don't buy this if you want 4K HDR with low input lag.<br/>Movie Fans: Look elsewhere if you want proper 4K image quality.<br/><br/>Product flaws that all buyers should be aware off before purchasing.<br/>1) The low input lag in 4K Mode is a lie.  In my own testing, the best I've ever gotten was 52-59ms of input lag at 4K 60hz.  The advertised low 25-30ms at 4K 60hz is not correct. I tested the input lag with a direct connection to a XBox One X, PS4 Pro, PS5, XBOX Seriesx X, NVIDIA 2080Ti and a NVIDIA 3080.  Do not purchase this projector for low input lag at 4K.<br/>2) This is not a good HDR projector. The peak brightness is much too low.  Look elsewhere for proper HDR.  This is worse than HDR400 on PC monitors.  Color output also doesn't encompass the full Rec2020 range.  I bought this projector specifically for 4K HDR with low input lag at 60hz.<br/>3) The projector literally has 0 ways to adjust the picture quality.  Even basic options such as brightness, contrast, gamma cannot be adjusted from the menus.<br/>4) The projector is extremely loud even when mounted on the ceiling.  The fan noise, is extremely distracting when watching a movie or playing a game<br/>5) The projector gets extremely HOT, even when mounted from the ceiling with lots of air flow.<br/>4) HDMI 2.0b port has major desynching issues.  The projector will lose signal very often.  The screen will turn blue and it will try to re-establish connection, often failing. The user will have to manually press the HDMI buttons on the remote.  This is not a HDMI cable issue. I used 3 different brands of Fiber Optic HDMI cables and 5 different standard Premium HDMI 2.0b cables.  All of the cables worked fine on a LG C9 and LG CX TV so the cables are not to blame.<br/>5) Half of the screen will flicker and be darker than the other side at random times.  You can read about this issue on AVS Forum.  The firmware update available on the product webpage does not fix this issue.<br/>6) If you MUTE the audio on the projector you will have an ugly MUTE icon on the top right of the projector that doesn't go away.  To get around this you have to leave the projector unmuted but turn the Volume all the way down to 0.<br/>7) The remote is very cheap.  Most of the buttons on the remote don't work because the projector doesn't expose any of the functions that you would normally find on a projector.<br/>8) Poor Warranty - Optoma refuses to pay for any shipping for repairs even if product is within the warranty window.  Warranty service is severely lacking. The RMA process will take 1-2 months as well.<br/><br/>I am extremely dissatisfied with this product.  I have never had this much buyers remorse with any other product ever.  In retrospect, I should have immediately returned the unit once the desynching issues started.<br/>Learn from my mistake, look at other projector manufacturers.  In comparison, my ancient Epson 8350 1080p projector still works flawlessly.<br/><br/>Historical Information:<br/>After 6 months of lots of video synching issues at 4K or 4K HDR, the HDMI 2.0b port on the projector is now completely broken, refusing to accept any 4K signal from any device.<br/><br/>When I first received this receiver I had major desynching issues right away.  The picture would randomly disappear, the screen would turn blue and then it would begin the signal searching process. Sometimes, it would detect the signal but many times I had to manually force the projector to search for a signal by pressing the HDMI button on the remote control. This would happen multiple times during a normal 3hr movie or gaming session.  On the day the unit broke, I used the device for about 4hrs with my PS5 and ROKU Ultra.  It took about 20 minutes of retrying until the desynching finally stopped.  Then after ~3 hours of playing games and watching a movie, the projector lost signal completely and now refuses to output any 4K signal any longer.  The HDMI 2.0b port appears to be completely broken now.  I checked the cables and they all work fine on other devices.  I have started the RMA process with Optoma.</span>

<span>Not cheap, great image and very bright.  The combination of 3000+ lumens and WXGA, with a very light unit makes this my top choice.  I've compared many projectors, and this is by far my preferred traveling projector. Larger than those mini-sized, yes, but I can project in well-lit rooms and still have plenty of brightness where those cheap mini projectors would be nearly invisible onscreen.<br/><br/>Used extensively for travel and presentations, a good resolution for photo/video, and does a great job of self-focus.  I very rarely have to tweak anything, except when I'm in a bad room with steep angles and poor projection surface.  Even then, it gets pretty close on its own to squaring up the screen.<br/><br/>The auto-adjust is a little sensitive to movement, say if someone bumps the table hard enough.  It will sense the change and readjust, which is distracting at times.<br/><br/>The remote is effective.  This allows USB as a video hookup, but this was unusably laggy in my experience, and also caused stutter in my video/audio output. (Windows 8 Pro, Lenovo laptop of 2016 vintage.) I switched back to HDMI, and all problems ceased.<br/><br/>One thing to be aware of, if this needs repair, you may have mixed results with Epson.  On a previous projector (same model), I was forced to check my bag on the airline, and found that when I got it back later, the corner of the projector had been cracked where the leveling leg is.  Epson sent me to an authorized repair center, which could not fix the issue because Epson did not supply those parts.  The projector functions fine, just does not have the screw-down leveling leg working any more.  So, good example of how tough it is, I guess, still works after a good smack, but would love to have some repair option besides a DIY epoxy fix.</span>

<span> UPDATE 8/20 - Just spent 1 hour with Epson support to hear that "Wireless connections are not guaranteed" ..."Did you try another computer". I have attached a video of a stream through the projector, the audio and video on my computer are in perfect sync.<br/><br/>I am a consultant and professional trainer and in a constant search for the perfect presentation combination.  I use a Surface Pro (latest version) with an I7, 16G RAM and 500G storage. I own 3 Epson projectors, the 9200, the 1751 and now the 1795F. All 3 of these have decent pictures, the reason I purchased the 1795 was the size and brightness, it gains about 1000 lumen from the 1751 and is HD (a little bit lower than WUXGA so the 9200 has a better picture).<br/>I had high expectations with  this projector and again I am disappointed by the under performance. The wireless is useless, terrible lag, video is VERY choppy and the audio wasn't even recognizable, just hissing and crackling. Switch to Miracast (another reason for purchase), I was using an Actiontec ScreenBeam 750 for wireless to the other 2 projectors, as far as connectivity it has been flawless. The Miracast on the 1795 is good, not great, connects up quickly but there is some slight choppiness on video (I wouldn't attempt watching a video on this), this chop is prevalent on local video (streaming from the Surface Pro) as well as if watching a youtube video. I've called Epson on this and they can offer nothing, seriously even a 20mps wireless connection should be able to handle streaming video smoothly and they have no answer why the video is choppy. If you want a semblance of decent video, hardwire to HDMI (still not flawlless).<br/>Lets boil this down, if you want a compact, light, easy to pack, bright projector that has Miracast and don't embed videos in your presentations, this will work but its overpriced and loaded with features that don't work.<br/>Hope this helps...</span>

<span>Great projector, very clear, bright, and easy set up.  Auto screen sizing and auto keystone works well.  Remote easy to figure out if you want to use it (also has buttons on projector for setup).  Fan noise is noticeable, but not bad unless you're in a really small room. Needed to cool the bright bulb.<br/><br/>So far have connected it to my laptop (usb connection is laggy so use HDMI if you can) and wirelessly to my iPad.  Direct wireless connection to iPad was really easy, took about 1 minute to download app, projector shows QR code, pointed my iPad at it and bam it was connected.  Could project my iPad pictures just like old school slide projector.<br/><br/>Very small light projector so it's easily portable.  A bit pricey but you get what you pay for.  The included soft-sided carry case has some padding, but a hard-sided case would probably be a good idea if you transport it a lot to protect your investment.  Wouldn't want to drop it in the soft-sided case.<br/><br/>I recommend this if you are looking for a good quality projector and can afford it.</span>

<span>I did not expect such an amazing product for so (relatively) cheap. I've been eyeing up a new projector for several months now but could not justify pulling the trigger on a $500+ projector.  The value presented by this projector is immense, specs on paper put it close to or at those projectors that are 2 or 3 times its price.<br/><br/>I've had this projector for about a week and immediately set it up on a ceiling setup in my basement connected to a surround sound setup that I had previously used with a TV. I was looking at a projector because my basement is a nice dark environment with an area allowing me to push a very large display onto the wall. I'm going to be giving my take on this projector in three categories: picture quality, audio quality, and the controls and ergonomics of this deceive and then I'll give some negatives that I've come across while using it.<br/><br/>OK, beginning with the video quality of this device. I've played around with many movies and have connected a play station to this to see how that went. The brightness of this device was touted as pretty bright compared to competitors at this price and above and I can attest that projecting onto a white screen that I have in my basement the picture is bright, crisp and the colors are pretty decent.  Of course, the colors aren't perfect by any means but there are some options that you can mess with in order to correct that. Movies came out great on this device, even with the large projection size, the picture is sharp and colors still pop. Moving on to hooking up a play station. Once again everything with the picture was high quality, and luckily, the response time seems near nothing when gaming on this device. Overall, the picture quality is great, not perfect out of the box, but with some adjustments can be improved. For a 1080p, $200 projector, there's nothing more that I would want.<br/><br/>Next, audio. This device does have a built in speaker but of course that is not going to be good enough for everybody. I did use this for a little before I connected external speakers and well, they work, they're clear, and can put out a good bit of sound. I do believe that hooking up external speakers is the best option with device to make it more of a whole package since the picture quality is so good.<br/><br/>The build quality of this device is pretty great. Removing it from its own carrying case (that came with the device) I immediately liked the look and feel of it. I wasn't sold on the look of the device through pictures but it does look great in person. The ports that came on this device are adequate, having two USB and two HDMI ports is a plus for sure and switching from device to device is a breeze. It even has an old VGA port if you're into that kind of stuff. The on-device buttons are illuminated and easy to see and use but of course I'd rather use the controller. The controller is small and suitable to adjusting settings and using for whenever. The build quality, and the ergonomics of this device and remote are great. Nothing really to complain about.<br/><br/>And just a couple of notes and things that I thought might bother some people. First off, obviously, the built in speakers. I really recommend using external ones in order to have the complete package here. Next, the same with many projectors, the fans can put some noise out. Luckily, loud speakers solves this issue :). Really anything that I think about really doesn't bother me when I remember that this projector ONLY COST $200! And I really can't stress that enough. This device is insane value for the money and I really would recommend anybody looking to get into projectors to take a look at this product, I have no doubt that you will enjoy it.</span>

<span>Getting it set up with the wifi was a bit of a process so I'd give that a 3. It is super quiet I'd give that a 5. Picture quality I'd give it a 5. Over all I'm very happy with it!</span>

<span>This battery powered pocket projector perfectly meets my needs when I do Sidewalk Astronomy. The battery lasts about 90 minutes but I have plugged in a power bank to keep it running longer.<br/>Lamp is bright enough for short distances. The focusing knob is smooth and brings images into a good focus.<br/>For me, a good purchase.</span>

<span>The Audio on this is nuts! So good and loud if you need it! I love I can use a 10 foot usb cable and random power brick to bring this to life. Took it camping but It was packed and the audio was just too loud for me.</span>
