<span> My family loves going to the movies because well all love movies more than tv shows. Going to the movies was getting a little expensive so we thought it would be a good idea to get a projector. Not just any projector but a high quality one that makes us feel right at the theater but at home. This projector supports up to 4K output making the image edge as clear as center. Unlike other low-brightness 1080P projectors, this video projector can present bright, vivid, and highly restored images even in a light room. This wifi projector is equipped with advanced Wi-Fi technology and supports 5G +2.4G dual-band wifi. It takes only one simple step on the mobile app, the video will be playing off the projector while freeing your phone/pad to do anything else like chatting, gaming, working etc. It also has 50% ZOOM function while supporting a max 300'' display, so you can easily be reduced to the size you need without moving the projector. The Bluetooth function can also wirelessly connect to your remote control and soundbar, speaker, headphone etc. The OSQ projector comes with a tailored bag. At home it can be used to store the projector &amp; accessories, when you go out, it can be also used as a backpack.</span>

<span>I’ve been using this projector for a couple weeks and it never went into any problems. The quality of this projector is way much better than the one I previously owned. I only use the projector indoor so not sure how it performs outdoors, but with the 800ANSI I’m very sure it can provide high quality pictures no matter indoor or outdoor.</span>

<span>In a market where the cost of these things ranges from $79 to many thousands it was tricky for me to gauge the correct price range for my needs.  I didn't need spectacular image quality to run the golf simulator that I'm building in my garage, and I have a lot of space so I don't need a short-throw projector, but I do need it to be reasonably bright because there has to be a certain amount of ambient lighting in the room. I took a chance and went with this model because its brightness specs looked to be a bit higher than the competition at this price-point.<br/><br/>The picture quality is very good and the brightness is certainly adequate, though I think I might be disappointed with less. The unit pairs easily with my Android phone and iPad (via wi-fi) easily and never glitches.  It's relatively light and mounts easily with a standard aftermarket 4-screw ceiling mount.<br/><br/>In the nits department I have it mounted just a few feet off-center and though the alignment feature works adequately it's quite rudimentary with only two values to compensate, and you have to align it by eye. If mounted any more than a few feet off-center (maybe 10 degrees - I experimented) it becomes very hard if not impossible to get a well-aligned picture.<br/><br/>Bottom Line, I'm quite pleased given my needs.</span>

<span>Good low-cost entry projector for dark rooms environment due to low ANSI lumens. LED lighting life of 80,000 hours can’t be verified if actually true. Most non-LED lighting is around 3,000 hours. If the LED light does fail early figure this could just be a “throw-away” projector.

<span>This projector is surprisingly good considering it is a budget/entry level type projector.  I had purchased primarily for a Halloween projection show last year, but find myself wanting to have frequent movie nights using my garage door as a screen.  Over 11 months of ownership, I have not had any issues whatsoever.<br/><br/>Picture: This is a native 1080p projector which can project up to 300 inches, but I often don’t go beyond 200 inch due to my space limitation. Software allows for reductions to fit most spaces well.  I purchased a 200 inch screen and placed it against my garage door which works very well.  Clarity and focus remain even when the picture is very large.  Colors appear accurate and vibrant, with little loss of detail when brightness is increased. I observed no crushing and blacks are decent, especially in dark environments, where it works best. Even in daylight with the shutters closed, minimal ambient light doesn’t kill the picture.  The manual focus and keystone are easy to use and once dialed in.<br/>Sound: Surprisingly good and useful. Menus allow for base and treble adjustments. Not like a surround system but just as good as most built in tv speakers, this one can fill a space well and even be too loud at max.  I recently returned another newer projector with fancier specs who’s internal speaker was worse than a cell phone(Nexigo PJ20) from 10 years ago and who’s Bluetooth was useless due to lag.<br/><br/>I suspect many of the Amazon bargain projectors are sponsored by their manufacturers as the videos online seems to grossly exaggerate their products , but I can say that this one is a great projector  and a worthy purchase.</span>

<span>I purchased this unit about one year ago.  The price seems to have gone up by $100 from when I purchased it.  I don't know if this is the result of inflation or whether the unit has been upgraded since I purchased mine.  I have not used this much so I can't comment on bulb life.  I purchased the unit to use at a large family event that took place in a medium to large casino motel event room in Las Vegas.  The unit performed very well.  I projected photo slide show with sound on to the large screen in the meeting room.  The image was very visible even in dimmed light.  I was able to quickly and easily plug the audio from the projector into room's sound system, and it worked very well.  The unit has many features to adjust the picture to fit the screen and maximize the quality of the picture.  My only concern was the USB input.  Unless it has been upgraded recently, it did not recognize some of my flash drives containing the photo slideshow.  I haven't tested it enough to know whether this has to do with the make of the flash drive or its connector.  However, I suggest trying a USB 2.0 drive and not try to use more current USB 3.0 drives.  Overall, I have been very happy with this projector.</span>

If yours is like both of mine, one day it'll just decide to stop working.<br/><br/>Update: After posting this review, TMY reached out to me and sent me a new upgraded projector for free.

<span>This is a really nice, lightweight projector. Easy to setup and use and has a bright picture. I use the HDMI input from my bluray player and tap the headphone jack to my boombox and away we go. It's more of a straight-on projector though which is the only thing I miss from my old projector. You need to mount it on a tall tripod and have it set for the middle of your screen. I use a 16' wide inflatable screen (about a 10' diagonal 16:9 image on the screen portion) in our back yard and I found a nice 75" tall tripod that does the job nicely. There is a keystone adjustment knob so you can be off a little but be advised you will not be able to focus the top and the bottom if you adjust it one way or the other. It doesn't get hot, barely warm after a 2 hour movie which is a huge step up from my old projector.  And it doesn't have to run to cool down like my old projector either. I got it for a great price during Prime Days and invert happy with it. I can transport the whole setup to a friend's house with ease for our monthly get togethers. I haven't purchased a Fire Stick or other similar device to try the network streaming capability yet but I might in the near future.</span>

<span>A Review of the TMY PT-06 2022 Projector Model with a comparison to the TMY V08 2019 Projector Model<br/><br/>This review consists of two parts, 1) an unbox and feature set review, and 2) and a review of side-by-side images between the two models.<br/><br/>Unbox review:<br/>The TMY PT-06 projector comes in a very compact, neat little box. I continue to be surprised by how lightweight these projectors are for what they can do, which is no different with this new projector. I am pleased that TMY does not waste a lot of packaging (being environmentally friendly) while still ensuring the projector is well protected during shipping.<br/><br/>As can be seen from the images, everything is neatly packaged. Within the box are:<br/>Projector<br/>Power cable<br/>HDMI cable (this is a nice add-on)<br/>AV to RCA cable (nice add-on, but will probably never use)<br/>Remote control<br/>User Manual<br/>FAQ booklet<br/>Quick connection information sheet<br/>Projector lens cover<br/>Cotton swabs, microfiber cloth, and a small screwdriver<br/><br/>The projector comes with standard features:<br/>1 HDMI port<br/>1 USB port<br/>1 VGA port<br/>1 TF (SD) card port<br/>1 AV output port<br/>1 HP (headphones) port<br/>1 female screw mount (on the projector bottom)<br/><br/>Taking the projector out of the box and setting it up took minutes. A nice plus is that the projector supports 100-240V, which given its small size and light weight makes it a perfect travel companion even on overseas trips.<br/><br/>The pictures show the difference in size, parts, and overall projector enclosure of the 2019 V08 model and the 2022 PT-06 model. The 2022 projector is just a bit larger (not by much). The layout of the top menu buttons has changed a bit between the models, but all features are still easily accessible. I am surprised that the labels have not been updated, as I would have expected new Bluetooth and WiFi icons to be added to indicate the new features.<br/>The number and layout of the boards have not changed between the two models. The enclosure of the newer model has some changes to the cutouts/air vents, probably due to the improved fan and the built-in speaker.<br/>Lastly, the remote controls between the two models have not changed and are interchangeable.<br/><br/>While the size has changed a bit, the projector still fits nicely within any small projector carry-case, including the TMY bag that was included with the 2019 model (and is now an optional purchase for the 2022 model).<br/><br/>The menu feature set of the projector is straightforward. Through the menu you can:<br/>Select Setting - change your projector configuration (Display, Bluetooth, WiFi, Language, projector mode, firmware update, etc)<br/>Select Media (Video, Audio)<br/>Select Miracast, iOS Cast, DLNA<br/>Select Source (HDMI, VGA, USB, SD)<br/><br/>Devices used for testing:<br/>Galaxy Samsung S21+ UW Android phone with a separately purchased USB-C to HDMI cable (if the Smartphone industry could agree on a standard here, it would be nice to have a single cable included for phone hook-ups to HDMI) and using Miracast<br/><br/>WD Passport drive connected to the USB port<br/>Amazon TV Fire Stick connected to the HDMI and USB port for power<br/><br/>External Bluetooth speaker using the Bluetooth option (new 2022 model feature) and my home WiFi (new 2022 model feature).<br/><br/>Review of Features and Testing:<br/>Bluetooth 5.1 - connecting was flawless and took only seconds for the devices to pair. The audio was great and without latency on the external speaker. This is an excellent option if you take the projector outside or even in a large room and use a stereo speaker setup.<br/><br/>WiFi (AC 5GHz) - similar to Bluetooth connection, found various SSIDs in my area and using the remote control I was able to quickly connect to my home WiFi<br/><br/>HDMI (Phone) - setting up my phone took just a moment. Using the USB-C to HDMI cable, I could connect the phone easily. I had to select the projector's HDMI source (it would be nice if the source were auto-detected) and disable Samsung’s Dex feature. If you do want to use Dex, it works fine as well. But, I was looking for a straight video display to test a movie. The movie display was not an issue (more on colors, etc. in my second review) and audio was played over my Bluetooth speakers through the projector connection. I could have also connected my phone’s Bluetooth to the speakers and lowered the projector volume using the remote control.<br/><br/>Miracast (Phone) - using Miracast (Samsung calls this feature Smartview), I could again easily connect my phone to the projector and broadcast my phone’s screen without issues. There was no latency in the video or audio, and the image quality was great (more about overall display quality in my second review).<br/>HDMI (Amazon TV Firestick) - this connection was again easy to set up. I used the projector’s USB port to provide power to the Firestick. At first, the Firestick popped a message about the power source, but I ignored it and could fully use all its features. Some of the images in my second review use YouTube videos on the Firestick.<br/><br/>USB - I plugged a WD Passport drive into the projector’s USB port. Switched the source to Media Video and navigated through the WD file folder structure using the projector’s remote control. I could start/pause/stop video on the WD drive with the projector’s remote control. Video playback was smooth as with all the other sources I had tested. I don’t know how much power the USB port provides. Therefore other external devices (including HDs) may need an additional power source or powered USB hub to connect.<br/><br/>Lens Cover - putting on and taking off the lens cover requires moving the lens in/out during the process. This is not a problem and nicely secures the lens with the cover on when retracted into the enclosure<br/>Keystone - The projector has a manual keystone correction ring on the lens itself (rather than an electronic correction). This worked well in the testing I did, and I could get a good vertical screen display by adjusting it.<br/><br/>Setting - adjusting the projector's setting through the settings menu was easy. For the display, several presets can be selected, or you can select to make custom adjustments.<br/><br/>Firmware update - if you are connected to your home’s WiFi, the projector provides an option to update it’s firmware. The firmware on my projector was the latest version, so I did not get to test how well the WiFi (remote) update feature works. Of note, the firmware update feature does need a bit of fixing by TMY. My projector indicated a new firmware update was available but failed to download it since it was already running the latest version (as I confirmed with TMY support). This can be a bit confusing and concerning since the messaging is not accurate. In their next firmware update, TMY will hopefully fix the messaging for the firmware upgrade feature.<br/><br/>Recommendations:<br/>TMY should include the projector carry case (which would make for good protection in the box), as I can only highly recommend having one to keep the projector clean and dust free when not in use<br/>TMY could include a soft cloth projection screen in the box to get you up and running even faster<br/>One note (which I will cover more in my second review), the brightness of the projector is acceptable in a dimmed room for movie watching or presentations. I wish the projector brightness could be further adjusted (or factory improved) so that it could also be used in an office meeting setting for presentations without having to dim the lights too much.<br/><br/>Summary:<br/>Setting up and getting any source to work with the TMY 2022 projector model is quick and easy. The menu layout and controls are intuitive and easy to navigate. The small size and weight make this a perfect travel companion. The projector costs around $120 on Amazon (often there is a discount of $30 available, and Amazon prices are known to change daily) which is a reasonable price given the features and quality of this mini projector. My family has been very pleased with this projector, and I purchased a second one for my daughter’s college room.</span>

<span>I bought this projector for my sister's son's school. They needed something affordable but that would work well to teach the class.

My sister even told me that if they needed another one, they would definitely go with this one as it is not only good, but also affordable.</span>

<span>I was excited to get this projector to replace an old lamp one.  I'm gonna start with the bad stuff first, which isn't really that bad:<br/><br/>- No auto-focus.  Didn't read that but not a huge issue.  It's staying in one place so set and forget.<br/>- Manual screen adjustment to change that trapezoid to a square.  Doesn't have a lot of range so projector has to be pretty close to straight ahead level with the screen.<br/>- HUGE picture!!!  No image size adjustment, or I haven't found it yet.  Had to bring it pretty close to the screen to get the picture small enough.  Not really a negative, but it just means it can't be behind your viewing area unless you sit 3 ft from the screen.<br/>-The included tripod is kind of flimsy and useless.<br/><br/>Now for the good stuff:<br/>- Really amazing picture!  I put on a Nat Geo documentary and I felt like I could've jumped on that whale and ridden it across the ocean!  Nicely visible during the daytime also.<br/>- Roku ready.  Connected my Roku Express directly to it.  No power issues with the USB power supply.  Included HDMI cable works flawlessly.  Ready for Boba Fett!<br/>- Remote w/ volume control!  Really great feature, especially with Roku where some streaming channels are quieter than others.  The last projector didn't have one so maybe not a big deal for some.<br/>- Built-in speakers are actually pretty good.  I connected external ones pretty easily, but the sound from the unit isn't that bad.  Haven't done Bluetooth speakers yet.<br/>- Makes kids happy!  My two kids were definitely excited and happy about it.<br/>- Quieter than the previous lamp projector we had.<br/>- Decent carrying case if you wanna take it with.<br/>- Pretty simple, straight-forward, practical design.<br/><br/>Overall, so far, it was an excellent purchase for the price.  Read lots of mixed reviews on other projectors.  100% recommend this one.  Not crazy fancy.  It's not gonna make you scrambled eggs in the morning, but it will bring back movie theater night!  Hmmm, we might have to get a bigger screen.</span>

<span>I've been using this projector, frequently, for months, it does the job.<br/><br/>What I hate the most?  Those hard touch buttons on the projector topside.  You'll never learn a proper way to touch them.  The presses will be too soft and unresponsive, or harder than you think is necessary for a key press. The key presses will be annoyingly ignored, or frustratingly doubled.<br/><br/>The image is bright enough; you'll need to be in a darkend room, naturally.  The single speaker is plenty loud enough for classroom use, and the quality is pretty good.<br/><br/>The remote has glow-in-the dark buttons, a nice feature, but the arrangement isn't intuitive.  The sound volume buttons should be more prominent and in a location where you'd naturally expect them to be.<br/><br/>The software interface isnt every intuitive.  Your non-technical coworker may struggle to setup a presentation.<br/><br/>Yup- it'll connect easily to your wifi and airplay.  I use my iPhone as a source, but I find it puzzling that the connection will frequently timeout,  and leave me hanging (and fumbling) in a presentation.  Also, there's no memory, so your wifi settings will be forgotten when you unplug.  Your projector and device must be on the same wifi.<br/><br/>I was impressed with the prospect of the little compartment on the side.  You can place your streaming stick inside, and the projector will adopt all the abilities of your Roku.  I have a couple different models of Roku sticks, and none of them fit well in that compartment. That hdmi port should have been placed a little higher (or lower), to allow room for the Roku's usb power cord; they don't fit well, consequently, for me, the compartment goes unused.<br/><br/>The projector has a single mounting point, so I use my camera tripod to support it.  The mount isn't IN the case, it's ON the case, and by itself is very weak- Im waiting for it to break off.  I made a gasket to surround the mount point and increase the contact surface, to stabilize the projector on the tripod mount.  It's a weird design mistake that just puzzles me.<br/><br/>The included case is nice.  The tripod is... well, not very substantial-  it's garbage, really, and you'll still need the aforementioned base contact gasket.<br/><br/>Would I try to talk you out of buying this?  Nope. Its very good for the price point, but you should know about the weirdnesses.</span>

<span>So I have used 3 times once indoor and twice outside. The first use was with the roku stick and had no issues at all, second time was outside with the laptop connected via hdmi cables. The first time no issue everything went perfectly second time it took me a while to get sound apparently this device accepted the WiFi signal from my fridge so be sure to turn the WiFi off if your not using it. Once I finally figured out the problem i had sound but it was too low to listen to with all the cars in the neighborhood and other outside noises.  The third time I watched outside we sat a bit closer to the device and it went well without any issue besides remembering to cut the WiFi off so we could hear. Then this time it was too loud so I had to turn the sound down so I wouldn’t disturb my neighbors. You will definitely need some speakers to connect if you want to enjoy this outside, maybe ones with a remote so you don’t have to keep getting up.  The remote didn’t work from far away so in order to adjust the picture when it got dark I had to get up and walk close enough to the remote for it to pick up. I image I was 20 feet away and had to walk 10 feet closer to get it to pick up. The remote has a lot of picture adjustments though so I was able to watch a movie in the daytime by adjusting the picture.  I had to readjust after dark though as the picture started to look bad with the decrease in lighting after dark. My neighborhood backs to the woods so besides squirrels deer rabbits and birds, it’s not too noisy just the normal outside white noise. Otherwise picture is good adjusts well sound is good when you can hear it. Also just an FYI you definitely wanna get something to tie your projection screen down if it’s windy out. I backed mine up against the shed and jammed the legs under the shed to avoid the wind blowing it away. I also adjusted the screen so the wind wouldn’t hit the screen. You definitely need a fire stick or Roku stick with this otherwise I couldn’t get it to mirror the movies from my iPhone 10 with sound and picture it was one of the other. My own videos and pictures from my phone played without issue. The laptop movie  was ok but it showed the box around the picture and bottom of the screen even while in full screen mode. The best picture I’ve gotten so far has been from the roku stick. I ordered a fire stick especially for the projector just waiting for it to arrive. I’ll keep it in the bag so I’ll have no issues later. I love that it comes with all the wires you need except the audio aux cord for the sound, I’ll buy a long one that will work for my patio setup outside. Great device I’m hooked!!</span>

<span> In short, this is an inexpensive fun projector that has a picture quality which punches above its price would suggest.<br/><br/>Pros:<br/>I paid $135 for this project. It feels and looks like a $135 project but the picture quality feels more like a $300-$500 Projector. Prior to this I have owned two high end projectors, a JVC and a Sony, each costing over $2000. This $135 projector is obviously not as good as a the Sony and JVC, but what I find amazing is that the Sony and JVC are not 20x better than this. So my point is this projector is great value.<br/><br/>In a dark room you can easily get about 75 to 85 inch enjoyable picture with this projector. Once you start pushing larger sizes its still usable but a little dim for my liking.  With a small amount of ambient light you can still watch the 75-85 display. If you are using it for presentations you can use vivid picture profile that is brighter but not as colour accurate.<br/><br/>I found the built-in speakers to work really well in a quiet room. For two people watching its adequate. Certainly way better than my laptop speakers but not as good as  your standard TV speakers. The Projector does allow for bluetooth connection so I'll have to try it with some bluetooth speakers at some point in the future. I was able to connect the projector to wifi but unfortunately was not able to mirror my Pixel 6 phone screen because google uses chromecast mirroring. I have a suspicion that the projector would work with samsung android phone but I don't have to test with.<br/><br/>Cons:<br/>-The screen that came with the projector just felt like a cheap white bed sheet. I didn't bother using it.<br/>-The black lens outer ring fell-off right out of the box. It is only there to hold on to the lens cover and doesn't have any other function so I'll just glue it back, but it was a bit disappointing.<br/>-The power cord that comes with the projector is way too short in my opinion so I would recommend getting a longer one. Thankfully its a standard two prong power cord. I'll link one below that should work.<br/>- The specs are bogus. Even if you spent $10,000 you wont get a projector with 9500 lumens brightness and 10000:1 native contrast ratio. Its fine, don't believe the specs, the projector is still worth buying.<br/><br/>https://www.amazon.com/Listed-2-Prong-Samsung-Monitor-Console/dp/B005C5ENLA/ref=sr_1_2_sspa?crid=M29F5R7GWXNZ&amp;keywords=two+prong+power+cord&amp;qid=1661104413&amp;s=electronics&amp;sprefix=two+prong+power+cor%2Celectronics%2C191&amp;sr=1-2-spons&amp;psc=1&amp;smid=A3RPN0HBLXDN8Z&amp;spLa=ZW5jcnlwdGVkUXVhbGlmaWVyPUEyQ1RaUVdEVzVWSkZIJmVuY3J5cHRlZElkPUEwODIzMzcxMVZDRlRUR1dTUEdTTyZlbmNyeXB0ZWRBZElkPUEwMzY3NDU3M1A0OVpQOVgyV0dTWSZ3aWRnZXROYW1lPXNwX2F0ZiZhY3Rpb249Y2xpY2tSZWRpcmVjdCZkb05vdExvZ0NsaWNrPXRydWU=</span>

<span>I have bought three projectors and they are about the same price. This is by bar the sharpest, brightest, and best looking projector on the market in this price category I can find.

None of these projectors are watchable with the lights on, BUT THIS ONE IS! It's very fast compared to other projectors and I couldn't be more satisfied. Are there better projectors? Absolutely, if you are just starting out a home theater on a budget and you want something that will give you a solid start and a bang for the buck at the same time look no further. If you can get this projector $150 or under, I think it would be a nice choice. Highly recommend!</span>

<span>I’ve been wanted a projector for years but hesitate to do so because I don’t know which parameters to be consider for a projector. Finally I decided to get a cheap one for our movie nights. The projector covers our basic needs including Wi-Fi to cast the movie from phone, Bluetooth to connect with speaker for better sound. The pictures projected on the screen is good. But the thing is the projector could not support horizon alignment but I think only expensive projectors support that. Another thing frustrated me a lot is I couldn’t project from prime video. Other apps and websites work. Everytime I tried to connect prime video to projector, the projector got auto disconnected out of the mirror screening.</span>

<span>Either the lens came with tiny chips in it that you can only see when the screen is fully black where there's dust inside I can't get too to clean. It's not an issue when literally anything on display. Picture quality and brightness seem great, you have to tinker with the settings to get the picture nice and sharp. The sound quality seems better than most say, not a lot of bass but clean and loud</span>

<span>What an amazing quality for the price. Tried many projectors but this one absolutely eleminates corner blurry which I have problem other projectors. I would highly recommend as you witness in the pic...go for it if this is in your budget</span>

<blockquote><em><div class="a-row a-spacing-small review-data"><span class="a-size-base review-text review-text-content" data-hook="review-body">
<span>There are a few reasons why I don’t give it 5 stars. First things first the fan isn’t necessarily softer than my previous projector it’s just on the right side versus the left. Secondly, the sound problem was very frustrating in the beginning because I have a fire stick and an Alexa so you have to make sure to change your audio settings in your fire stick to “gaming mode” when using the projector or it will not play sound. Lastly, I hate that when I turn it on I have to manually go to “hdmi” it’s not just automatically selected, definitely my least favorite thing about this. Also, when it’s on you might hear a soft ringing sound from the projector when sound isn’t playing. The picture quality is great after you turn it off and on a few times when you first get it because when I’d focus the center the edges would get blurry and vice versus. I spent $100 bucks more on this projector than my previous one and for the most part worth it. I enjoy the sound when streaming.</span>
