<span>Pros:<br/><br/>- You won't find anything in this size that's cheaper<br/>- The picture brightness and quality is excellent<br/>- No wrinkles aside from the extreme corners<br/>- Compared to other vinyl screens, the smell is quite low and goes away after 24hr.<br/><br/>Cons:<br/>- Their assembly video is for an older model that uses riveted holes instead of the tension rods. Please post a video that uses the updated model.<br/>- Mounting hardware can only be mounted to studs on on side of the two screw tracks as studs are ~2in wide and the screw holes exceed this. I put both screws vertically aligned on opposite screw tracks and it mounted fine.<br/>- Tensioning. Oh boy this was difficult. On the second attempt, I aligned the frame down the millimeter on every corner and made sure to attach springs on opposite sides in pairs to prevent the material from shifting. Even after doing all of this and spending two hours doing it, ended up with two minor ripples in the top left and right corners. I did the suggested massaging of the corners as stated in the manual, however this did not improve it. These are fairly minor, but I feel like the company should address this. It seems the screen is ever-so slightly too small and the material is not getting pulled tight enough on the corners compared to the rest of the screen.<br/>- The middle bar needs to be better secured as even lifting the final screen from the top aluminum frame is enough to dislodge it.<br/>- The company needs to tighten the manufacturing tolerance of the black border as it's a few mm too big and is slightly wavy.<br/><br/>Overall, while this was a pain to assemble, the results are great. Again I have to state that it's a bit unfair to knock this screen too much as for the price and size, it cannot be beat. With such a low price I think you have to ultimately accept some things.</span>

<span>There is way too much screen fabric included in the 100" screen size (I suspect they include the same amount of fabric for a 110" screen), and the tension bars aren't long enough, which is just bizarre. This results in the screen not having enough tension to create a fully flat surface *and* the screen material bunches and sticks out at the corner. Also the felt/velvet/whatever frame that you snap on the end is a pain to install and doesn't produce a clean, straight line.<br/><br/>Finally, you actually *want* a thicker frame because of how projectors work - they tend to throw light a couple of inches outside of the screen image, so with this screen, if you use the entire screen, you end up illuminating your wall outside of the screen.<br/><br/>I don't recommend this screen. There are kterntives at a similar price point, which, I'm hoping will correct these issues when I eventually buy a new screen and invest the 2-3hrs in assembling it.</span>

<span>I put this together by myself. Took two days and a lot of empty space. I actually enjoyed making all the measurements and building it. Best instructions ever!! Whoever writes these instructions needs cloned so they can write instructions for every company. I cant express it enough. If everyone wrote instructions like this, the world we be a greater place.<br/><br/>It definitely rejects ceiling  light....but some shadows hitting it perpendicularly still show. I used this with the Optoma Cinemax P2....which is one of the brighter projectors at 3000 lumens. I had no issues watching shows in daylight with a window right next to it, open blinds and all. Regardless of how bright it is, it still looks better with the blinds closed and lights off.<br/><br/>Great screen for the price!</span>

<span>Husband and I bought this to replace a similar Optoma DLP projector that we had for ~6 years. For the same price point now, this one is way brighter. We used to have to wait until dark to see anything properly on a projector, but this one is still super clear in the middle of the day (barring direct sunlight of course). That aspect alone is worth the upgrade for us, because we can get way more use out of it. The picture is very good; colors are bright and accurate. I also love the focus knob; since it's so big, it offers very fine control and it's easy to get it focused perfectly.<br/><br/>The only cons I have are small: (1) It takes a really long time to turn on and switch inputs compared to other projectors I've had. Not a big deal, just a little annoying. (2) No dust filter! I don't know why Optoma doesn't think dust filters are necessary. Apparently they only include them in "dusty climates," whatever that means. Without one, dust will collect in the projector and make it more likely to overheat and have parts break down (that's what happened to our last one multiple times). If you are tech savvy enough, you can open the projector up every so often and vacuum the dust out to make sure the projector lasts a long time. Also just make sure you place it in a well-ventilated spot / not right up against a wall and definitely not in an enclosed space like a cubby shelf. Don't just rely on the projector telling you when it's too hot, something could be damaged or starting to melt a little before the built-in sensors go off.<br/><br/>For future reference, if something does go wrong, don't be afraid to fix it yourself. The most common issue I've had with DLP projectors is a bad color wheel. If your colors start flashing weirdly and you hear whirring/clicking from the projector, it's probably the color wheel. You can get a new one online for &lt;$30 and replace it yourself. Just look up a video.</span>

<span>Not going into length on this. But after 2 years, white dots are beginning to take over the screen. This is a failing DMD chip. Contacted technical support who informed me the chip was $400. Then there's a $110 cost, right out of the gate. Plus shipping and I'm sure other fees. To fix a chip will cost the same as a new projector. Not to mention the part is not in stock. I informed them that this will prevent me from ever purchasing another Optoma product. And that I'd share my experience. Didn't seem to matter. I would encourage you to steer clear.</span>

<span> I've had this projector for over 6 months now, so I think my review is pretty objective. I LOVE this projector!! Read below for more.<br/><br/>My Setup<br/><br/>I set up this projector in my very bright living room. I have 5 7-foot windows perpendicular to my screen, so we get lots of natural sunlight during the days here in Texas. Even with that, the picture is quite clear and not washed out, at least IMO(first two pics).<br/><br/>I paired this projector with a CineGrey screen. I highly recommend using the light absorbing screen material if using in a bright room. It really helps with daytime picture quality. I think I spent another $120 for the CineGrey.<br/><br/>The next two pictures and video are with my window shutters closed to block out as much light as possible. You can see a marked improvement in picture quality. However, this projector really shines at night or in darkness. It's theater quality and a bright, crisp picture.<br/><br/>Pros<br/><br/>1. Bright picture, even during the day.<br/>2. The sound is quite clear, especially if sitting below or near it. I have a sound system, so that feature is muted on mine. But during initial install I did test that out.<br/>3. Lightweight...easy to handle.<br/><br/>Cons<br/><br/>1. Ceiling mount options are limited. I purchased a universal mount and had to shimmy it to make it work.<br/>2. Limited keyhole adjustment. I spent too much time trying to get it perfect.<br/><br/>My overall advice for anyone thinking about using a projector in living rooms or bright rooms is to get the highest lumen projector over 3000lm you can afford. Obviously 4k projectors are better, but you can't beat this for a 1080p.</span>

<span>Originally I rated this a 3 star projector. But, the execution here is truly phenomenal. The complete package comes in at one extra star. And, I've updated my prior review. After even more testing I found that the black levels are... acceptable.  It has good traits. It has bad traits. The good do outweigh the bad.<br/><br/>In short: if you intend to replace a TV with this projector, then by all means pick it up. I was sporting a 10ft screen (120" diagonal) and at first glance, with some ambient light, I was very impressed. The color is truly excellent, as others have noted. It is so excellent it shines in bright ambient light, catching the eye and filling in the image. The color is what makes this LED projector shine (pun intended). It is lovely.<br/><br/>The problems begin when you lower the lights for a bit more clarity because... well, there isn't any. The exact same image you saw with ambient light? That's nearly what you are getting when the lights are low. There isn't any extra dark hiding in the shadows. It's going to be good color and only acceptable dark forever.<br/><br/>In its favor this projector sports 30,000 hours of lamp life. This is near-TV levels of lifespan for the light source, normally the trouble area for projectors. It touts being rainbow-effect free, though I oddly thought I caught some here or there. Did I mention it has magnificent color? It has LG's WebOS built in and can capably stream many, many wonderful apps in full 4k (not Disney+ or Hulu at this time). It is light. It is svelt. It has the back-lit magic remote.<br/><br/>But, it has poor, poor black levels, requiring you to wash out the picture to bring them up in HDR (far better performance in SDR). It has decent, but not great, input lag for gaming (40+ ms for 4k, 50+ ms in SD). It isn't the greatest optically (mine had minor focus uniformity issues). It isn't truly all that bright, despite the incredible color brightness. Strangely, that will affect you more in the dark, it seemed to me, than in the daylight. Also, the brightness is more an issue with the desired size of my screen (120"). At a smaller size the brightness may be far more tolerable.<br/><br/>Like I said, it has good and bad traits. This projector is good. I preach the black levels, especially with HDR content. But, it is by no means the worst projector I have ever used.<br/><br/>4 stars,</span>

<span>I've had this projector for a couple days now and it has blown me away. I upgraded from an old optima hd20 because I wanted 4k hdr and this LG projector delivers both. As long as this projector gets the rated 30k hours usage, i'll be completely satisfied.<br/><br/>Setup was quick enough, I used an existing ceiling mount from my old projector. When I first turned HU70LA on, it recognized it was upside down and flipped the image automatically, that was a nice touch.  I'm projecting from about 15ft away onto a 133in screen and the image is plenty bright, even with some ambient light in the room things are still watchable. Something really noticeable, especially in HDR content is how vivid everything looks. The colors are really vibrant. The throw distance i'm using is about as far away from my screen as i can while not making the image too large for my screen. If you have a longer throw distance you are going to need a bigger screen. I did have to use the keystone alignment, it only adjusts vertically and not horizontally (but i only needed vertical keystone).<br/><br/>LG's webOS is integrated just like their TV's. The magic remote is just that. Magic. I really like the motion control cursor and the smart features of the projector. I didn't think i would use them a lot, but it is just really convenient rather than turning on my xbox or apple tv. It is also really easy to have different image presets and swap between them (for example a gaming preset and then a movie preset) CEC works to turn on my receiver so with the one remote it is all I need if i'm streaming things from webOS. If you have used webOS on any of their recent tvs, no surprises here.  its the same great experience.<br/><br/>Normally i don't like the smooth motion image interpolation when watching tv or movies, but on a projector and screen this large i've become a quick fan. Everything about it just feels better. (Not for gaming though, only for video content consumption)<br/><br/>Being able to play pc games at 1080p and 120hz is pretty amazing. One of the reason i selected this model was for pc gaming on a big screen and not having to sacrifice high refresh rate is absolutely awesome. The input lag on game mode (while i'm not sure what it is) was not noticeable to me.<br/><br/>My only image complaint is the black levels aren't super great. They are decent, but when you go watch something darker like Batman the dark knight or Mr Robot, i found I had to turn up the brightness setting on the projector to actually see details in the dark. Doing this washes out the image a little bit, but it still is a great improvement over my old projector. I just made a preset for darker things and switch to it when needed.<br/><br/>It would also be nice if the power supply was internal so it used a normal plug to the projector from the wall rather than using a power brick, but i feel like that is really nitpicky. In my situation i just zip tied it to my ceiling projector mount arm and called it good. It isn't as clean as an install though as just plugging a cable directly from the outlet into the projector.<br/><br/>Also wanted to make a quick note, make sure that you get cables rated for 4k@60hz (18Gbps). I first tried with an old high speed cable that was only rated for 4k@24hz (10.2Gbps) and I couldn't push 4k content to the projector. Just keep cabling in mind when getting a projector like this.<br/><br/>EDIT: After using this projector for a little over a month I tried to get the Disney+ app on it but it is not supported. This projector is running webos 3 instead of 4 (you need 4 for the more recent channels like disney+). My LG TV bought in 2017 has been updated with webos 4 and can get Disney+ so i'm hoping that LG updates the projector as well at some point.</span>

<span>Placed the projector in the dedicated movie room. I can control the light in the room very well and the brightness is perfect for that environment. If you wanted to place this in a living room or in a room that has more light it may not work since the brightness is not the best. The picture quality is great and the user interface as well as the menu is very easy to use and the projector was basically set up ready to go immediately. Overall it's a great deal for what you get in my opinion.</span>

<span> Best short trow 4k hdr projector you can get for sub2k.<br/>It’s about 9 and 10 feet from lens to screen wall and pic size of 130”.<br/>It’s not bright enough for Cali sun on a day, like at all, but with blank out curtains working as a sharm. Nice colors, crisp picture, really bad qs01 android stick, decent speaker ( i got alexa studio for my small aprt) thry hdmi to optic converter.<br/><br/>One minus it’s can be loud i got projector right on top of my bed and can hear it with full lamp power on. But you used to it quite fast.</span>

<span>TLDR version: Heaven for PC gaming and movies alike. Long version below.<br/><br/>I use this projector for PC gaming (I run an RTX 3080) and as a home theater for steaming movies and shows (right now, primarily the latter, but that more because of my schedule, and I hope to change this soon).<br/><br/>The picture quality (to include brightness and HDR) on this thing is top notch, so let’s get that out of the way. Frame rates at resolutions that are pretty competitive with high end PC gaming monitors give you a lot to love about this monitor for gamers... oh and at 100 inches. The price for performance on how this thing functions as a gaming monitor is pretty incredible at this size. Also, for the picture quality at the size you can easily get out of this thing, it beats the snot out of paying 5k + for an 80ish inch OLED TV. This thing compares favorably in terms of brightness, resolution and color with all but the highest end OLED TVs for a FRACTION of the price. Picture-wise, this thing is nothing short of amazing. I do not have this set up in a completely blacked out room, and I would say that the issues I have with natural lighting while using the projector during the day are different but equal to the issues I have watching a TV in a similarly lit room (light dilution vs glare, etc.). That’s a solvable problem; consider a window blackout solution if that’s a concern. Also, if you’re going to go in for this beast, I highly recommend a dedicated screen. Don’t debase the amazing picture quality of this beautiful machine by projecting onto a painted wall, that’s just silly.<br/><br/>The Meh: Sometimes the projector seems to get confused with input devices; when I want to use the projector as a computer monitor, sometimes I need to power cycle one or the other. Not sure what this is about, but it’s barely a minor inconvenience, and the couple of times it’s happened it has been when I am deliberately messing around with display settings pretty hard. It may very well be entirely on my PC. The remote that comes with the projector is… mixed. The Android TV dongle that comes with the projector and the way the remote controls both projector AND the “smart TV” ish functionality is pretty great, the remote just isn’t the most responsive. Slow, spaced-out and very “deliberate” button pressing seems to be the key. This is not a big deal in itself; the finicky remote is particularly annoying when adjusting projector settings and the volume on the onboard speaker (which functions but isn’t going to win any awards). So, while the android TV dongle and it’s seamless integration with the remote is a really, really nice touch, it isn’t perfect. Beyond some of the remote clunkiness, there isn't an organic solution for Netflix, and in general, I found that a 4K fire stick it more responsive as a streaming device… the great news is that you can pop a fire stick into the same HDMI slot AND power source on the monitor that is intended for the android TV dongle. Right now, that’s what I’m doing, and the biggest downside seems to be that I have another remote in the mix (but I like the Amazon one better anyway). When I’m feeling brave I’ll see if I can figure out how to power on the projector through the Amazon remote, but it hasn’t bothered me enough to try yet. Anyway, to me this is more of an option than a real complaint, and the fact that the projector comes equipped with what is essentially an organic smart TV functionality should be seen as a bonus… especially at this price point.<br/><br/>EDIT: I definitely recommend a sound system that matches the quality of the picture on this projector to do the experience justice. Finding a sound bar that worked with this set up was a BIT of a challenge. At the end of the day, something that has eARC/HDMI functionality is the key, but I also recommend something with a wide variety of input format compatibility. My initial review was pretty heated because I fought a Klipsch Cinema 600 for 2 weeks with missed results - after all that it turned out it was the soundbar (I’m fairly tech savvy, but the problems and solutions to them when they worked were way bizarre, and the soundbar was theoretically compatible). I went with a Samsung HW-Q800, and that was easy to set up, and HDMI ARC worked with the normal amount of setting fiddling, and it sounds great. I edited my review to hopefully save someone the headache, and to correct my mistake in thinking the issue with connectivity was on the projector - it was not.<br/><br/>Bottom Line: this projector is…. Amazing. The price per performance on a projector that delivers most of the functionality you’d expect out of a high end gaming monitor (for a similar price on a WAY smaller screen) at up to 120 inches is just. Plain. Dumb. In the best way possible. If you have a stereotypical “man cave” game room and you want to add a screen that is just stupidly big and beautiful for both a quality gaming and home theater experience, look no further. As a point of comparison: Next to a top of the line OLED TV (my original option for down here) that could perform in gaming at the same level, you might say that the OLED looked better- but for 83 inches you’re going to pay something like 4 times the price of this projector (my reason for taking the plunge and buying a projector for the first time). To me, this projector offered 85% of the experience I wanted from an OLED TV at 25% of the price- that math was easy. I personally feel that by almost any other metric, this projector matches or wins in all categories against any remotely comparable TV.</span>

<span> Great project with native 4k, awesome to pair with Xbox x, really like the throw, got about 140” @ 14ft.<br/>Projector doesn’t have any built in OS and it makes me sad after using XGMI halo with “smart TV”.<br/><br/>Projector has poor quality sound and doesn’t support any Bluetooth transmission, my home theatre doesn’t have 3.5mm (aux) so it one of the reason of returning.<br/><br/>Also I got “used” condition and it has some blurry circles, I tried to wipe leans but didn’t help, quite afraid that it’s gonna be more noticeable after some time.</span>

<span>This projector is marketed as a gaming projector…  And it kills it in that department.  The picture is awesome, the response time is awesome for a projector, and the brightness is great!  The picture pops in gaming mode and it is truly epic to play games on a 120” screen!  It’s not bad for watching movies, but you will not have the blackest blacks.  You’d want to check out a different projector if that’s all you care about….  BUT, it’s still a fun watch for movies, and has a very clear picture.  I’m happy with my purchase.  I’d give it 5 stars for gaming and 3.8 (lol) stars for movies.</span>

<span>The projector is 15ft from the screen and I can't get the the image to be at 130".  It's only 100" at 15' away from the wall.  I'm going to return it and get an Epson</span>

<span>This is my 2nd Optoma Projector. The projector itself is fantastic. I was however very disappointed in Optoma’s tech support. I was having a problem with the picture pixelating and cutting out. I called Optoma tech support and was forwarded to a waiting line where a recording told me how important my call was. Every 20 seconds or so it gave me the option of staying on the line or leaving a message. After 30 minutes I gave in and left a message with the re-assurance that they would get back to me ASAP. They never did! Fortunately I was able to figure out that the problem was with the HDR setting on my amplifier. I’m not sure everyone will be able to figure this out, so if you buy just be aware it is a great projector but tech support is terrible.</span>

<span>There weren't very many reviews on this particular projector.  We were looking to upgrade to 4K, but didn't want a super big price tag.  This was decent priced for what we were looking for.  I compared the UHD38 and UHD50X to this projector.  The only thing that I noticed a big difference was the lumens and the price.  This was only 400 lumens less than the UHD38...and everything else they had the same exact features on it.  The UHD50X difference is it's easier to fine tune the image alignment with 5-15 % vertical lens shift and wider 1.3x zoom.  I pretty much had my previous projector set (1080p HD projector) and it was easy to set this projector up.  I didn't need to adjust much at all.  The UHD35 is a bit cheaper than the UHD38 and it probably because of the lumens difference. I purchased the 2021 model.  I have a screen made to work well with ambient light, so we don't have lighting issues...picture is phenomenal as it is very crisp and clear even during the day.  You will not be disappointed....we definitely are very pleased!  I didn't have the issues that some reviewers said that they had.  It was very easy to set up and we are very pleased with our purchase.<br/><br/>11/24/21 - I wanted to give my experience with this projector after having it for some time.  Still amazed by the beautiful picture it produces.  The details and color when we watch movies are fantastic.  My kids have their Nintendo Switch connected and they love having their friends over to play on the big screen (we have a 120" screen).  Again, picture is great in daylight and shades are down, but light coming in doesn't affect the picture. The only thing is this does not have blue tooth connection for a speaker so we purchased a device we connected to the speaker jack that lets us connect a blue tooth / wireless speaker to it...works great!</span>

<span>Upgraded from my 3-yrs-old optoma HD27e, I don't regret to buy it. The 4k picture density is unbeatable in a 100" screen when compare to normal 1080p projector.<br/><br/>It's brighter than HD27e. So in bright mode it is a little bit too bright for movie and the fan noise is quite obvious (but just like hd27e, it is still acceptable). When playing movie, it is good to turn the brightness mode to dynamic. The contrast would be enhanced. In this mode, the projector become very quiet. Since I don’t need to adjust the keystone correction, the enhanced gaming mode is perfect for me. It provides real 4k gaming with very low input lag. Comparing the input lag of my dell s2721dgf gaming monitor, I don't feel any different. No downsampling this time, the 4k picture quality remain the same under this mode. It's the real deal for me since I'm looking for a 4K projector which is good in response time so that i can enjoy both, watching 4k movie and playing game.<br/><br/>The HDR quality is quite acceptable within projector compatibility. According to my research, I think optoma has made some adjustment in HDR remapping so it is better than previous models. The only drawback is that it has some wired bug to set it in non-HDR mode with google Chromecast. If I turn the “Match content dynamic range” off in chromecast, the color wash out. So I need to keep this function on to avoid the bug . That means I can’t turn off HDR content in chromecast.<br/><br/>Overall, I’m very satisfy with this purchase.<br/><br/>Pros:<br/>Amazing 4K picture quality<br/>Sharp focus<br/>Enhanced game mode improves input lag quite obviously<br/>Enhanced game mode can output real 4k@60hz, no downsampling.<br/>Dynamic eco mode is useful to enhance contrast and lamp life.<br/>HDR quality is quite acceptable.<br/>The projector size is small and light weight.<br/><br/>Cons:<br/>Enhanced game mode don’t allow keystone adjustment<br/>Some wired bug in non-HDR mode with google Chromecast. (fixed)<br/>No Len shift. Only digital.<br/>Some bug in remote control when HDR is on.<br/>No ARC/eARC<br/><br/>-------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>Updated May 3, 2021: Chromecast is updated the firmware and the bug is fixed. Once you’ve installed the new software,  you’ll be able to dig a little deeper into video settings than was previously possible. In the new “advanced video controls” area of settings, you’re now given the ability to choose your preferred dynamic range format. You can always stay in SDR mode now.</span>
