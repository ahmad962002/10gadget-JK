<span>Good speakers overall and decent sound. Not as much bass as others describe but decent for the price.</span>

<span>Amazing sound, crispy and loud enough for the size. Very happy with the purchase. I was a little reluctant by having the amp in one of the speakers but this is great, space saver and no difference with having another device outside.<br/>I changed the equalizer in Spotify (pic attached) and you can get a lot more bass from the speakers.<br/><br/>The only complaint is the power cable, I wish they make one long enough to facilitate installation.</span>

<span>I purchased these on July 23, 2021, but am only leaving a review now on August 10, 2022. I've had them for just over a year. The speakers have been fantastic and in my opinion sound great. We installed these on 4x4 posts cut very low to the ground (bottom of the speaker sits about 4" or 5" off the ground), mounted low and a few feet from the edge of our pool. They are at ear level when inside the pool.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, the Bluetooth functionality began to fail about three weeks ago and finally failed completely this past weekend. I had registered for the 3-month extended warranty after purchasing the speakers, but I never received a confirmation and I never bothered to follow up (my mistake). I've reached out to Pyle through their website. Waiting on a response. Will revise my rating appropriately based on how responsive they are and whether they resolve the issue.<br/><br/>I paid for them with my Chase Amazon Prime Visa, so if Pyle does not come through, my Amazon Prime Visa automatically extends the warranty coverage for an additional year. Just a lengthier warranty process I'd rather avoid if Pyle can come through for me. Either way, I'll get this fixed and will definitely purchase another pair.<br/><br/>By the way, we liked these so much, that we bought a second pair for our outdoor fireplace. Those get much less use, but are still working well.<br/><br/>Highly recommended despite the failure I experienced. Hopefully it is a one-off. I have not read others' reviews, so I don't know if this is a common occurrence or not.</span>

<span>So as you can see I mounted these under my eve. I filled the space between the birds mouth on the end of the rafters with 3/4 inch plastic sheet I had. So as not to squash the soffit. They are about 30 ft apart so I angled them in a bit to fill the patio with sound. They do that beautifully. I powered mine by adding a split receptacle behind the master speaker under the eve. This way with flip of a switch they power up. Now there are many other ways to power them, such as Bluetooth cords and so on. Or just plugging the master into a hot receptacle. I'm a little anal and chose this. The other side of the split receptacle will control strand lights she wants down the road from a neighboring switch. The only bummer if I have a bitch is the supplied speaker wire appears to be 16 or 18 gauge. It was too short for my purposes and in my opinion undersized. So I used 14 gauge stranded copper wire I purchased separately from a local hardware store. The speakers are very easy to install. If you are not familiar electricity, hire an electrician for custom power supply as my install shows. I am not suggesting just anyone play electrician...</span>

<span>The speaker connected to my Samsung TV just fine using the HDMI cable. It comes on automatically when I turn on the TV. It helps with the sound depth and the dialog. It's narrow, so there is no speaker separation to give a stereo effect, or to make the sound move with the characters on screen, but I'm willing to give that up because the soundbar fits neatly under the screen. I think the woofer works just fine for my tastes—the balance is good. I connected to my iPad with the aux cable in order to have better fidelity. I haven't tried the bluetooth connection yet.</span>

<span>**BACKGROUND**:  After Years of waiting ( mostly to see when micro-LED Technology would be firmly established and the price not too insane ), we got ourselves a 75QNED90 LG Living Room TV.  Awesome TV, but just so-so sound.  Dialog wasn't sharp enough ( for my old ears ) and often buried by background noise/music.  Anything with any significant Bass sounded "rubbery".  I thought we could go all discreet components ( AV Receiver and at least three somewhat decent speakers, no sub ), but my lady didn't want to see all that, so no joy there.  I had Never heard a Soundbar that I thought sounded decent before, but it seemed to be the only way to solve our sound problems.  **SHOPPING**:  Started reading and reading and stumbled on VIZIO's V51x-J6, after reading dozens of on-line articles, blogs and Amazon Reviews.  I had started looking for a 3.0 or 3.1 soundbar, but kept coming back to the VIZIO V51x-J6.  The reviews ALL seemed to REALLY LIKE THE CLEAR DIALOG CENTER CHANNEL, which has it's own level adjustments !!!  That and the Really Great PRICE had me "looking at it hard".  I kept trying to find anything better for under $300 and I could not, so I bought one.  **SETUP**:  Set it up last night.  Easy Setup.  TV feeding the VIZIO via ARC, the VIZIO pretty much did everything, all by itself.  I had to press the two power buttons, to sync the wireless sub with the sound bar, but that was about it !!!  Our ROKU Ultra Remote ( which had been controlling everything in the room ) still did !!!!  *****RESULTS*****:  It started out-of-the-box Way Better than the TV Sound.  A little fiddling using the VIZIO Remote ( IT is Excellent, with LOTS of adjustments ) and we soon had a Brilliant Soundscape !!!!  We spent several hours listening to all sort of music, tv, movies and YouTube videos, adjusting a bit here and there.  AWESOME SOUND !!!!!  ...especially for the Price  -  Sound Way Better Than I could have Hoped For, at a Price that made us both Very Happy !!!!  The only ( tiny ) flaw is the sub, which is a bit "thumpy" on certain rock music tunes, and altogether Too Present above the rest of the mix.  We turned it down to the lowest setting, and it's fine...  Pretty good actually.  Listening to stand up bass on Bluegrass, then electric bass on some Albert King+SRV tunes, you could actually Clearly Hear every bass note being played ( versus the usual clumps of mushy, muddy, pounding bass that come out of most Subs ).  SWEET SOUND, GREAT PRICE.  Should have done this a long time ago !!!  Will post again if anything new happens, but on day-two, WE ARE REALLY, REALLY HAPPY !!!!!!  - Don&amp;Deb -</span>

<span>I spend more on a TV to get a great picture without any stuttering or motion blur.  Sound is second to me.  This system sounds nowhere near as good as my brother's multi-thousand-dollar setup.

<span>Got this for my theater projector room. About a 15x25 room with a 120 screen 4K projector. I mounted the speakers to my ceiling and left the subwoofer center stage on the floor under the projector screen. The sound quality is crisp with good mids and highs, and the bass is thunderous. It rattles the upstairs floor when I and the family are watching movies.<br/>The speaker line is decent however, I went with a thicker guage as I have some custom lengths to run to get the speakers where I wanted them. I'm driving the audio with a simple Asus gaming laptop on a single 3.5 mm audio connection. Future plan is to build a small form factor media PC and drive the audio system via optical.<br/>Overall, I could not be happier with this system. Logitech makes great products.</span>

<span>04-24-2013<br/><br/>My #1 attraction to this was the lack of a bulky, heavy receiver that would have all manners of features like video switching capability, where the only thing I would ever use is the volume knob. Having given this a rough test (everything will eventually be wall mounted), I was insanely impressed with the sound quality that I expect from Logitech, especially in the 2.1 desk speakers that I've been using and loving for years. My expectations were met and exceeded by the lack of space this takes up compared to other systems (for a similar power output).<br/><br/>With my setup, the subwoofer is under a rear speaker, and the attached control unit sits nicely on the nearby corner table between my couches so there is nothing on the main wall except the projector screen and speakers (projector is fed HDMI video from a desktop computer) and the system volume is literally within arm's reach. The remote does feel extremely lightweight--I would wager to say that the batteries compose roughly 75% of its total weight--but it has only the buttons it needs (I believe seven total) to be functional and not a thousand others like I sometimes see on remotes. Its small size makes it possibly easy to lose, but that's a user error.<br/><br/>Feeding SPDIF in right off my motherboard, it decoded DTS on DVDs without any problem. There are little speaker icons that light up to reflect which ones are active with the current audio format it's being fed, which seems to be similar to the LG HTIB system at my family's house where a little icon on the screen would display the audio format. During things like intro sequences, where you go from the menu to various copyright warnings and studio logos and whatnot, it tends to change a lot, and that might irritate someone who is easily irritated. Although once the movie starts and the format stops changing, those icons go off and the only ones left are a small number of status lights which is the same as any other piece of electronic equipment.<br/><br/>The metal plate around the inputs/outputs on the subwoofer got VERY warm to the touch. Not sure I would say hot, but it should definitely be considered when placing this that all of the magic is happening inside that enclosure.<br/><br/>Speakers felt very solid, not huge but not tiny, and a set of basic universal wall mounts will let me put them up on the wall.<br/><br/>The settings for how to handle 2 channel input is really useful if you're like me and have a lot of video files, or plan on using it to play music--one mode just treats it as a 2.1 (standard stereo with subwoofer), the other is to use 4.1 where the back left/right mirror the front left/right, and one is a 3D mode that uses all 5.1 for some kind of 3D effect. I imagine I'll be able to get a better idea of what it sounds like once everything is positioned.<br/><br/>If you buy this based on the description, you won't be disappointed, but if you're an audiophile used to $5000 sound systems then I suppose you might hear a difference. The only setting that seemed unusual to me was the speaker level settings--this one adjusts the front left/right as a pair, as well as the back left/right--I've only ever seen level adjustments done individually, but when you think about it, you should be positioning the speakers in the proper places anyway, especially horizontally. In that case, you're probably going to adjust front and rear pairs the same anyway, which requires two steps instead of one. Ceiling mounting rear speakers would put them farther away than they might be on the wall, so you might have to adjust the collective level to make up for the distance, but with this system you can just make one adjustment for that instead of two.<br/><br/>Altogether, very satisfied with Logitech, as always!<br/><br/>05-12-2013<br/><br/>ADDENDUM: Following a few weeks of the system being properly set up and wall-mounted... couldn't be happier.<br/><br/>Remote works great, and contrary to a review I remember reading before purchase that said you had to point it straight at the unit to get it to work, I can point it basically anywhere. It does get frequently misplaced, but that's my fault (my projector remote is a similar size and I frequently misplace that as well).<br/><br/>Also, a feature I somehow missed previously was the auxiliary stereo line-in on the control module. As mentioned before, I frequently use this system for just ambient music playing, and this would normally mean running the desktop computer just to supply audio. With this jack, you can use a standard 3.5mm audio cable to connect straight to an mp3-playing smartphone or ipod or anything with a standard headphone jack. I can shut down the computer, saving energy and cutting back on unnecessary heat production when I would only be using it for music.<br/><br/>The 5.1 DTS decoding works wonderfully and I have no regrets. It's the perfect compliment to my Viewsonic Pro8200 DLP projector and extra-long-twin bedsheet tacked to the wall serving as a screen (for real though, it's a great substitute to an expensive bulky screen).</span>

<span>I bought it to replace a z906 I had since 2013. Aside from everything being mostly the same for the same price almost 10 years later, the d-sub cable (for the console to the subwoofer) is much shorter than what it was back in 2013. I had to purchase an extension.<br/><br/>The sound quality is what you'd expect from a 5.1 costing $350. It's "okay" compared to a pair of quality bookshelf speakers. The subwoofer handles most of the mids together with the bass which gives it a slight muddy sound in comparison.</span>

<span>In the past, Sony has been fairly reliable for quality and design. This sound bar is pretty good, maybe not the best, but overall we're not unhappy.<br/>I ordered this as a Christmas gift for my husband... but it arrived in a very clearly marked, incredibly odd shaped package right in front of him so installation was a bit earlier than expected. It seemed ridiculous to try to pretend it didn't arrive. Anyway, setting it up to our newer RCA 4K TV wasn't  difficult. You plug the bar and subwoofer into outlets, hook the bar to the TV with a &gt;&gt;&gt;NOT PROVIDED&lt;&lt;&lt; HDMI cable, and the included optic cable if your TV doesn't have an ARC input. Then follow the set up guide to get it going. About that... no matter what your available inputs are this requires the HDMI cable, so it's really annoying that one is not included. We ended up taking one from a game system the kids don't really use so we could finish set up. I'd be really annoyed if this were Christmas day and we didn't have one. Anyway, make sure you have one.<br/>The sound quality is good. I can't say great because getting the subwoofer set isn't simple. It's still a bit overwhelming. The volume on the bar itself does not auto adjust, so if you're watching something and there's an unexpected explosion then the whole house knows there was an unexpected explosion. Super fun when you're asleep in another room at 1AM. I don't think the TV itself has an auto adjust for the volume, so that might not be an issue for every TV.<br/>But there's one "side effect" to this sounds bar that we really did not expect, and frankly still find perplexing. We have a 4 month old puppy, and set up her crate in the living room. The subwoofer sits to the side about 6 feet from her crate with a storage bin between them, and the bar sits overhead by about 4 feet and back by another 4 feet. Immediately after we got this working she freaked out completely. She began barking, howling, whimpering, and shaking throughout her entire body. She then peed and pooped several times in her crate before we could figure out what was going on. She has never acted like that before, she's actually pretty chill. We turned everything off, helped her and cleaned up, then sat with her on the other side of the room and tried again. And again she freaked out, nearly choking herself trying to get away. It was so sad! We still can't figure out what it is about this that she's reacting to. We removed the subwoofer, changed every setting we could, moved her to another room, it doesn't seem to matter. It's just a strange situation. She calmed down after a couple days and we've been able to use this, but she cannot be near it when it comes on. The best we can figure there's some kind of electronic frequency from the equipment that just is, something we can't adjust, that she can hear or feel. My husband has a recording studio so he tried to test the sound frequencies but the TV itself produces them and alters what he can record or test.<br/>So I guess it's just something to watch for if you have a pet. This isn't enough to send it back, and she's adjusted okay after a few days as long as we do our part and pay attention.<br/>And buy a new hdmi cable if you buy this.</span>

<span>Got these speakers to use for a garage/outdoor theater project.  I can't speak to long-term durability, but I bought these with several other passive and active competitors.  I did a head-to-head with these versus the others, using the same video, and the same amp when applicable (obviously no amp needed on the active/powered speakers).  The sound quality on these was noticeably better than the competitors, and they cost less.

<span>I am using 4 of these speakers in my Samsung surround sound system. Two for the front left and right and the other two for the rear left and right. For the money, these speakers have a clean, clear tone and they come with the mounting brackets. They were a good addition to my sound system. I matched these up with a Polk Audio center speaker and movies and TV shows sound great! The speaker inputs are the screw down connectors (not RCA style connectors). They work well when running 16-18 gauge wire. For the low cost of a pair of speakers, they are a great buy!</span>

<span>After 20 years our old system gave up. This system fits our budget and has everything you need . Only that the wire to connect the speakers were not enough. Because of our set up, this was not a plug and play scenario. We called tech support and we were connected to a rep from the Philippines and because of time difference we were connected to another rep from the Caribbean when I called the following day. Both tech were equally good. They went far and above our expectations even calling Yamaha tech the following Monday when the office opened. They did not pass us from one tech to another. Each tech made sure that the issue is resolve before they let us go. These are hard working representatives, not the lazy ones who pretends you called the wrong department.</span>

<span>This was a replacement for a Samsung system that went south!<br/><br/>Delivered July 30, 2021<br/><br/>Pros:<br/>1.  Great Sound :-)<br/>2.  Completely wired System.<br/>3.  Easy to Setup.<br/><br/>Cons:<br/>1.  The speakers that come with the system are 6 ohm speakers and the amplifier needs to be configured to use the 6 ohm speakers.  It would have been nice in the quick setup guide to point this out with instructions on setting up the system to accept the 6 ohm speakers so that you do not have an impedance mismatch.<br/>2.  The manual must be downloaded from the Yamaha site on the Internet.  If you like a printed manual you should have a laser jet printer.  The manual is 112 pages of awesome information.<br/>3.  If you have an old turntable, you need a preamp to use it to play your old records.<br/>4.  The speaker wire that comes with the system is extremely thin and I would suggest buying 16 gauge speaker wire which will have lower resistance thus having a better sound.<br/><br/>Overall:<br/>1.  Yamaha still makes great audio products.  I'm happy that Yamaha has not gone to China and that the amplifier in manufactured in Malaysia.<br/>2.  I would recommend this system to anyone who wants good audio at a good price.<br/>3.  The amplifier delivers 100 watt power to the speakers so whatever speakers you use, it will probably handle very well.</span>

<span>Admittedly the TV hook ups can be intimidating, (for me anyway) and I dreaded set up, especially combined with the TV Settings but figured it out and I really love it, has great sound and is plenty loud.

<span>I was looking for a mid-range soundbar and I feel the Polk Audio Signa S4 delivers on all levels without breaking the bank. The sound is absolutely amazing. Sure it's not the exact same as have speakers all around the room but it is close. I have a tv with earc support so I can use my tv remote to control the soundbar which is a definite plus! (1 remote is better than 2) I use this soundbar in a living room with very high ceilings. Another plus is the voice adjustment control to make the spoken sounds even more clear. I would definitely recommend this soundbar if you're not looking to drop a grand on one but still want high quality sound.<br/><br/>IMPORTANT NOTE:<br/>After using the soundbar for about a week, I noticed that the soundbar would turn on as it normally does when i turn on the tv, but there would be no sound coming from the soundbar. The only way to fix this would be to turn off the sound bar then turn it back on and it would work as normal. This became very annoying understandably! I tried to get help from amazon support and polk support but they were both unable to help me. I ended up returning the soundbar and getting a new one. I've had the new one now for about a month and I have not noted any issues.</span>

<span>UPDATE 4-15-22:  I found a switch (that I don't recall now) on my iPhone and iPad that enabled me to play Apple Airplay through the Polk React, that is a non-issue now.  Otherwise, my review stands as is.<br/><br/>I've had the Polk React for over a week.  I replaced a Sonos Beam and my review perspective is based on that.<br/><br/>BOTTOM LINE UP FRONT:  I want to give the Polk React 5 stars, but in good conscience cannot give more than 4 due to sound quality and not being compatible with the Apple TV streaming device for Apple Airplay.  I cover these below.<br/><br/>SETUP AND CONNECTION:  I was nervous, I read it was easy, but had a bad experience with the first generation Sonos Beam with Alexa.  That process was horrible, taking two hours to get it right.  Then the Beam needed updating, which had to be hard-wired to the router to do, causing a total reset of the Beam and another two hours to restore.<br/><br/>Happily, the advertised setup/connection of the Polk React was exactly as stated.  Plug it into a power source and HDMI to the TV's HDMI/ARC jack, and within 30 seconds the React was connected to Alexa, where I went to it’s app to do final setup.  Full process, including plugging in — 2 minutes and I had full (for me enhanced) Alexa capability, including streaming music.  I never entered a user ID nor password, the Alexa app handled it all.  Which brings me to this VERY IMPORTANT TIP:<br/><br/>I did not catch this when ordering from Amazon, but there is a note on the right side lower ordering block, a box with a blue check for Amazon to link the device to your account.  That was the key to the ultra-fast hands-free connection.  I did a mock reordering and happily discovered that was the default position for an Amazon React order.  DON'T UNCHECK THAT unless you want a more hands-on connection process.<br/><br/>SOUND:  Disclaimer — I have tinnitus in both ears plus a 15% hearing loss.  However, I have to give the edge for sound to the Sonos Beam, which was a bit more high fidelity IMHO.  I have tried the various sound options on the remote control.  Frankly I couldn’t discern a noticeable difference.  The voice control (AKA treble) made no noticeable difference,  I almost agree with another reviewer who suggested the React didn’t sound too much different from their TV's Internal speakers.  The React does, but not much.<br/><br/>Except, when I had a program on that had high quality audio, an eagle screamed in one scene and the sound was projected to where I thought it was literally outside our house, then on the other side.  That was very impressive.  I found that noteworthy.  Just the sound bar, no sub woofer nor rear speakers.<br/><br/>One reviewer suggested the internal bass system on the React could shake the floorboards.  I live too close to neighbors to crank up the sound to see if it does, but the one time I took the sound up mid-way, I did get some pretty good vibrations.  However, I’ve noticed some distortion on higher level sounds with the sound up.  I was not sure if that was the source or the React.<br/><br/>PERIPHERALS:<br/><br/>I am somewhat disappointed with the remote control.  It’s challenging to aim and find the sweet spot on the React, especially from an angle.  As previously mentioned, I don’t find the sound modes all that different.  I mostly just use the remote for Alexa and streaming music when the TV is off.<br/><br/>I use an Apple TV streaming device for video sources; it works with the React for streaming video and sound.  When I tried to use Apple Airplay from my iPad, it would not connect unless I disconnected the HDMI and used internal speakers; was not a problem with the Sonos Beam.  I queried Polk Support, which replied the React does not support the Apple TV's Airplay streaming system at this time.  That was not noted in the various product descriptions and reviews I’ve read.<br/><br/>The React has Bluetooth connectivity.  I see how to do it, but haven’t tried it yet, as the only music service I use is Amazon Music, which Alexa connects to, as well as other services.<br/><br/>I’ve found the React's volumes for various networks and services are not too different.  However, the Alexa voice seems to be low when streaming music.  The Sonos Beam had anything Alexa much lower in volume than what you might have been watching.  Advantage:  React.<br/><br/>MISCELLANEOUS:<br/><br/>Some reviewers mentioned things that concerned me.  One said the volume of the sound mode announcement from the remote control was too loud.  Not for me.  Another said there’s never a time when a sound bar light is off.  Not for me.  The light that stays on when In use is a low level brightness LED on the front, about 1 mm diameter.  When the system is off, all lights are off unless using Alexa.  The Alexa light bar works like any Alexa system, it illuminates when actively using Alexa, but not while streaming music.  The light bar also momentarily illuminates white while adjusting volume, bass, or voice from the remote control.<br/><br/>Another person suggested when streaming from a mobile device or through Alexa, the program abruptly stops after 20 minutes.  That was a real concern as I like to stream music for hours.  But happily, not for me.<br/><br/>I did not mount the React on a wall.  I’d suggest it’s weight could be an issue unless the studs align with the hole template.<br/><br/>SUMMING UP:  Overall I am fairly satisfied, but I expected more in what I thought the sound should be.  And I am frustrated I cannot use Apple Airplay.  Otherwise, a very good purchase in its price range (mine seemed to be on a Polk short time price cut at about $180; the Amazon price went up to $270 two days after ordering).</span>
