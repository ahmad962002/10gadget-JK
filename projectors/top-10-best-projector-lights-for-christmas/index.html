<div class="slideshow-container">
<blockquote><em><div class="a-row a-spacing-small review-data"><span class="a-size-base review-text review-text-content" data-hook="review-body">
<span>We first saw these lights while staying at an Airbnb in Broken Bow and they were so gorgeous I had to ask the host about them.  Got them as an early gift for my hubby to put up for Christmas and they do not disappoint. We absolutely love them!! They cover so much area and twinkle beautifully. Thinking of getting more to add to our backyard for use all year. Expensive but worth it.</span>
</span></div></em></blockquote>
<p> </p>
<blockquote><em><div class="a-row a-spacing-small review-data"><span class="a-size-base review-text review-text-content" data-hook="review-body">
<span>If you buy this and think the remote doesn’t work, you’re not alone! Every time I hit the power button to turn the laser off, the lights blinked and stayed on. Grrr. It took me a while to figure out the remote is -very- sensitive to how long the key is pressed. A very fast press works fine.<br/><br/>The only other minor complaint is that the security cable for the device could be broken with bare hands without a lot of fuss.<br/><br/>Otherwise, the laser does what it should, and I’m happy with it.</span>
</span></div></em></blockquote>
<p> </p>
<blockquote><em><div class="a-row a-spacing-small review-data"><span class="a-size-base review-text review-text-content" data-hook="review-body">
<span>It worked for a month and a half and stopped working.  It was nice while it worked.  If I knew it was only going to last that long, I would not have purchased it.</span>
</span></div></em></blockquote>
<p> </p>
<blockquote><em><div class="a-row a-spacing-small review-data"><span class="a-size-base review-text review-text-content" data-hook="review-body">
<span>I bought this after going to a Christmas display and wanting the same effects at home.  It produces the same firefly effect when shining on trees.  I also like that it came with a cable lock to keep it from being stolen.</span>

<span>I would like to say, I bought this light in 2019, This year in October it stopped working, I called LEDMALL RGB, explained, mine had stopped working. I have to say this was the nicest company I have ever dealt with.<br/><br/>They only asked for proof of purchase which was easy to send them, and my address, and they replaced my light for me, was in about a weeks time it came.<br/><br/>I love these lights. Almost holiday time, and I can turn on the the Christmas scene lights. My neighbors love them, I do as well.<br/><br/>They are very bright, clear, many options, speed to choose from.<br/><br/>If lights are what you were looking for, this LEDMALL 18 patterns in 1 works perfect for me, and hope if you choose these, you will enjoy them as much as we do.<br/><br/>Great company, can't say enough about how nice they are to work with if a problem comes up.<br/><br/>I run them 7 days a week, just different times of the year I use different scenes. Has a timer so I have them come on at dark, and run for 4 hours, then they shut off..<br/><br/>Enjoy if you choose these, personally I would only buy from the LEDMALL company. Great company!</span>

<span>We set the projector up about 50 feet from our barn and it has plenty of power to project, with nice detail, all the 10' diameter shapes.  Love everything about it.  Did notice a little bait and switch with the Amazon add though.  It said it was IP67 rated but the instructions say it is only IP65 rated.  The difference in rating means no water can get inside vs. some water can get inside.</span>

<span>I recommend this. Nice solidly constructed mostly metal unit that has more functions than most of these lasers.  This can be used for Christmas, Halloween and I suppose any other holiday.  It is bright and sharp enough to project clearly on a 2 story 3500 sq foot home. The stars is the most useful pattern with the Christmas symbols being cool but to me they just don’t look right when projected on a large house. The security feature is useful and I roped mine securely around a small tree.  I’ve used it nightly for a month and it functions flawlessly in rain snow and bitter cold. The only thing I do not like is that it does not remember settings and defaults to same fast paced blinking, which I personally do not like so I have to slow it down each time.  I wish it had a totally stationary projection feature, which I would prefer to use. You can slow it down very slow so each design remains for maybe 7 seconds before switching. The remote has one of those old fashioned metal antennas that pull out, which makes me think it could break easily. Overall I recommend this item without hesitation.</span>

<span>This covers a really big square foot and is really pretty with the picture very clear.  Only down fall for me is when you unplug it, and plug it back it in, it does not save your settings you had it on previously.  Not hard to change back, but just aggravating.</span>

<span>The big drawback is that it won't remember your settings after power down.  So when it powers back up, (say with a dawn to dusk timer), it will auto play the snowfall effect (during October), and also play the music at full blast, which is loud enough to disturb neighbors.<br/><br/>Besides that it works fine.

<span>I ordered three of these originally.  I wasn't impressed.  It's not a laser.  It's a light that shines on a ball and mirrors inside the housing, and projects it onto the wall -- kind of like a disco-ball.  The remotes don't work well - you almost have to be right next to the projector to get it to work.  The projection image isn't any better than the ones at home depot for $25.  On top of that, the service appears lacking with this company.<br/>One of the projectors I purchased was not functioning properly at all; it seemed the disco ball wasn't rotating correctly and it didn't look like 'falling snow.'  So I sent it back for a refund within a week of its arrival, and clearly stated that the projector didn't work like the other two.<br/>I didn't get refunded for it, nor did I receive a replacement.<br/>I have to believe, because of the quality and functionality of the product, and the lack of service I received, that this is not a good company.

<span>UPDATED REVIEW AT THE END.<br/>Item stopped working on Christmas Day. I will try something else next year. my other branded laser lights still work!.  Dropped to two stars since the unit lasted less than a month ...Hope my review helps either way.<br/><br/>The Likes.<br/>I love how the movement of the lights makes it look like snowfall, rather than simply going around in a circle or the typical "laser" motion.  The packaging was decent and product came in VERY good condition.  I was able to use the Remote control indoors, close range, and fairly simple to use.  Plug is the US version not requiring any additional purchases of plug adapters.<br/>Dislikes.<br/>Using indoor, this puts out quite a bit of light. however, Most (I believe) would use outdoor, and this does not put out as much light at greater distances (around 20-30ft)  I had to reposition closer to my house, and lose some effect essentially just to make it more noticeable.  The range on the remote is nearly void, you have to be close up to the light to get this to work, like within 7 to 10 ft.<br/><br/>My opinion on this light is in comparison with the other option that just has a circular motion (and is white)  It is brighter, remote range seems to work alot further (I can control the unit form within my house, about 30 feet away), but downside to that one, was I had to buy a plug adapter as it didnt have the appropriate one for the US.<br/><br/>OVERALL<br/>I would prefer the movement that this unit has, however, wish the brightness of the laser was higher, or matched my other unit.  Not a bad purchase, but maybe if purchased again, use for close range stuff.<br/><br/>UPDATE:  DECEMBER 25. 2019,<br/>UNFORTUNATELY for me this was my worse purchase for Xmas decorations. The unit last less than a month and the remote made it impossible to use. Today the unit decided it did not want to stay on. just a huge hassle. I decided to return completely as I had multiple issues. Will search for another option.</span>

<span>We were disappointed.  The product arrived on time and worked perfectly.  It was a 5 min set up.  We bought it because we wanted white lights only.  The light it produces has a bluish tint and when it gets further away or hits at an angle, is not really white but breaks back down into it's components (damn physics).  To be clear, however, it does create the closest you will get to white laser lights.  We are not really returning it for that reason.  It just wasn't bright enough-- and by that I mean it did not light up the house enough for our taste (we use a lot of lights normally).  Unlike previous products, the white spots were definitely visible but it creates a subtle illuminated effect.  The swirling motion was also nice.  Again, I don't want to be unfair to the product.  Our neighbors complimented us on it and were shocked when we said we were returning it and putting up old-school lights.  In summary, the product does create white spots that are definitely bright enough to see even with a street light right out front on the street.  The set up was easy and the swirling effect was nice.  We only tested swirling white light since that 's all we wanted.  However, if you prefer your house to look like the Griswald's (Iike we do) it will not be bright enough.  If it was cheaper we would have kept it and added it to the other decorations but we paid a premium thinking this would be the only lighting we needed so are returning it.</span>

<span>We had this installed for about a week. At first it was a little disappointing because it doesn't do white lights (which is a big part of why we chose it). I decided to keep it originally because I did think it added something to the fainter red, blue, green projector we had. I really liked the brightness of it and the fact there was motion.<br/><br/>Yesterday this display would no longer do the motion and only flash (even after unplugging and plugging back in). The remote also stopped responding. I called the company and they said they would replace the remote and transformer. We have only had this unit for a short time and it was so expensive I have decided to return it instead. It was working fine for at least a week but to have problems so early is too big of a sign for me.<br/><br/>One thing worth noting and this seems to be true for all LEDMALL products (we originally bought Motion Pattern Firefly 3 Models in 1 Continuous 18 Patterns LEDMALL RGB Outdoor Laser Garden and Christmas Lights with RF Remote Control and Security kit) is that if you use a timer (either the built in one or a separate one) it will only do the default setting meaning everyday you have to change it or turn it on manually if you want something else. I didn't feel it was a deal breaker in this unit but I did in the 18 pattern one.</span>

<span>Loved it... for 3 nights.  Then the remote quite working. Yup dead batteries so replaced with new ones.  Remote was working and it showed a red indicator light on the remote that it was signaling.<br/>BUT... no change on the light head. Couldn't turn it off, couldn't change colors nothing works. Oh Wait it did work... oh only that one time. Now it wont' work.  Such a cool idea and lots of promise but not quite there.  Maybe they'll get their act together and fix the problems.<br/>Sigh... Thank You Amazon you'll take the return.</span>

<span>I bought this unit expecting to play music from my indoor Desktop PC and transmit to it via Bluetooth (about 30 feet away). With both indoors, it worked fine; nice clear sound.<br/>Placing the unit outdoors, even 6 feet away thru a glass storm door was a big problem. No signal!<br/>Sure, I could open the door, but that's not practical in the winter time.<br/><br/>Also, the unit only displays 1 color at a time. The "white" has problems aligning the 3 beams onto the same point, resulting in "red" outlines.</span>

<span> It works! The camera itself is a bit flimsy but it tightens to base well. The videos are clear (once you adjust the focus). The plastic screen was a good fit for the one that I have in the video (the eyeballs) but for my big window I went to the dollar store and bought a cheap frosted shower curtain to cover the whole window.<br/><br/>I totally recommend this!!!</span>

<span>I actually really like this projector. I am all about decorating for any holiday so this was perfect for Halloween and Christmas as it has both of those settings on it. I found that it works best simply projecting it on my white garage door at night. It also works on the sheer plastic liner that's provided which I have used on my window. You do have to make sure to position the projector so it's close enough to your surface or choice so that it's vibrant and clear. After, you adjust the lens a bit, then I find that the image and color quality are perfect. My neighbors love walking by our house during the holidays!</span>

<span> Well, this is on the cheaper end, so keep in mind you get what you pay for. We had trouble keeping it where we aimed as the knob that tightened it didn't work well and it's not really clear like HD. That being said...it's really fun and we had so many compliments!! We would change the display occasionally as you do that manually as it will only stay on one scene for about 10 seconds then loop on that one. It was really easy to install, too. Only took about 10 minutes from start to finish. Definitely worth the money! I have posted a video of the ones we used. It also has a scene of eyeballs, but we thought it was weird LOL. Just a lot of floating eyeballs? No thanks! LOL we really just cycled through the skeletons, pumpkin scarecrow and the zombies (people trying to escape??)</span>

<span>After doing research for a laser light I found this one. I saw a video comparing this verses star shower.<br/>There was no comparison. Ledmall is by far brighter and well built. I ordered the two pack and tried one in the house. I was sure I made the right decision. When I installed them outside I found a problem with the one I didn't try inside. I went to their web page and left a contact email. This was at 5pm eastern time. To my delight I received a response within minutes. I thought it would be the next day. I answered a few questions and replied. Again within minutes I was given a tracking number and was told a new unit was on the way which I received that Wednesday. The new unit worked an as I stated in the beginning I definitely made the right choice. They are a very responsive and professional company. I definitely recommend them. They have a great selection.</span>

<h2 style="text-align: center;">FAQS</h2>
<h3><h3>What is the best Xmas projector?</h3></h3>
    

There is no best Xmas projector, as different people will have different preferences. Some people might prefer a projector that is small and easy to carry around, while others might prefer a projector with a lot of features. Ultimately, it comes down to personal preference.
<h3><h3>How does a Christmas projector work?</h3></h3>
    

Light from a Christmas projector is directed through a patterned slide. This slide is placed in front of the lens of the projector. The light shines through the small holes in the slide and creates a design on the wall or other surface behind the projector.
