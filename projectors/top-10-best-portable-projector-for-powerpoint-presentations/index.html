<span>It is a very nice little projector, very portable but you need to consider a couple of aspects before you buy it. First it is not a real Full HD 1080p of projector, it's native resolution is WVGA (854x480), when projecting from your PC in 1080 the image gets downscaled and loses quality which is very noticeable, so make sure you adjust your PC to the right resolution if you want to get a clearer picture, especially when showing text in the screen. The other thing to consider is the power source, this projector consumes 10W which equals 2A at 5V, most of the usb ports in a PC can't give 2A but just 0.5A,  if you have usb 2 or 0.9 if you have usb 3 ports. The same happens with most of phone chargers. I made the mistake to plug the projector to the PC usb port and turn it on without letting it charge first, as the port couldn't handle the amount of current, the projector would turn on and off intermittently every few seconds, when I found out what was going on I turned it off and kept it plugged to let it to charge, that made it work. The projector doesn't come with a charger but only a usb cable, I suggest you get a proper 2A usb wall charger I got the Amazon Basics one, it works well.</span>

<span>My wife and I spent almost an hour trying to get this machine to work, and she is very good at setting up electronic equipment.  We were trying to get it to project single photographs off an iPad.  I was using an HDMI cord.  I could not get the projector to respond, no matter how many buttons I pushed, or how many connections I tried, or how many other ideas I tried.  After plugging and unplugging it several times we finally got it to project the photographs.  What a pain!<br/><br/>One suggestion: when you think the set up is correct for the cords, follow the instructions for pushing the buttons, which is weird, and then push the button for each step, and WAIT.  Wait for a few seconds because the projector does not respond quickly or well.  Make sure you push the whatever out of the button when you push it down.  A quick or light tap will not trigger the machine to react.  Once the menu is projected and you are clicking the small arrows up down and sideways, wait until the unit responds on the screen.  Try to make sure you hit the button firmly.  Another pain is, if you wait too long to hit the buttons after the menu is on the screen the menu goes away.  It actually goes away fairly fast.  If that happens you have to start from the beginning.<br/><br/>Once your picture is on the screen, wall, or whatever, there will be a series of buttons along the bottom of the screen.  So, make sure the projector is adjusted so you can see the bottom of the projected picture with the buttons.  I found that trying to move along the bottom buttons was a chore because the machine did not respond to many of my clicks.<br/><br/>IF you are projecting from a micro SD card you will see a button along the bottom that allows you to reduce the size of the picture.  I was able to reduce the size below what I could achieve on the iPad.  You would have to transfer your photos to a micro SD card before projecting them, but that may  be a necessity if you need smaller pictures like I do.<br/><br/>The projected photo is good enough quality for my purposes.  You can see the picture without all the lights off and curtains closed.  I can see the picture in the daylight without any lights on as long as my blinds are closed.  Compared to other photo projectors I have used, which contain a huge lightbulb and a prism to throw the printed photo, this one is quite strong.<br/><br/>Getting the picture small enough to fit on an 11 x 14 area is impossible.  The smallest picture I could get was about 18 x 24.  As a result, projecting an entire photograph from an iPad, and getting as close to the wall or canvas as possible, even the smallest picture will be blown up to a large size.  It would be OK if you were trying to crop a photo or pick out a small area of a photo, but that is about it.<br/><br/>While the artograph prism projector does get a much smaller photo projection, it is also much weaker.  The artograph prism has a big bulb that gets the projector extremely hot.  You can actually burn yourself on it.  The artograph is also far larger unit, and a person must work from a printed photo because it is not digital.<br/><br/>This Bigasuo projector is small, stays cool, and the picture is bright.  A lot brighter than the artograph prism.  The sound isn't loud to me, but the projector noise was irrelevant to my use.  I have heard others that were much louder.<br/><br/>Other problems with this projector include, but are not limited to, the buttons are the same color as the projector, and the symbols telling a person what the button does are very small, mysterious, and not raised above the button much.  The small, same color as the machine, buttons make it hard to adjust the projector.  The amount of focus is slim.  If the lens was able to focus closer the user could make the picture smaller, which would be useful for people like me who want a small bright image.  The HDMI cord is a problem, plus the manufacture gave us two HDMI connections.  And they are not labeled number 1 and number 2.  Why?  Why not another USB port or a full size SD slot?  The micro SD slot is a pain.  The micro SDs are so small I cannot handle them well.  I keep dropping the things.  Why not use a full size SD slot and allow the user to put the micro SD into an adapter to use the micro SD?<br/><br/>I have not tried to use the streaming or video/movie functions.  I have not tried to use the CD functions.  I cannot say how long the projector will last.<br/><br/>Overall, I think the projector is worth the price and should work well for family use.<br/><br/>AD2</span>

<span>This projector is definitely not worth more than the lightning price of $118. I only received this a couple of days ago, so I can't speak to the longevity of this projector, but I can share my observations regarding it's performance. So, the things that I like are the built-in DVD player, the lens cover and the carrying bag. The things I don't like are the zoom feature - if you use it whatever ratio/zoom setting you put it on it is then projected onto your screen, with NO way to remove it. I've checked the menu and settings page and written the seller with no answer or resolution provided. The only work around I have found is simply to not use it and move the projector closer or further away. The bluetooth feature has worked, but the sound using it and when plugged into the headphone jack resulted in a buzzing sound. The other thing to note is, if using it with a firestick or roku, when looking at the menu features built into those, it is impossible for all the text to be in focus. If the bottom part of the screen was in focus then the upper portion was not. I guess this is why it states in the description that it is not recommended for PowerPoint presentations. I also found it interesting when looking up this company that Fangor actually comes up on the page. If you've been shopping on Amazon for a projector it's quite likely you came across this brand. Apparently, they are one in the same. Now, what I found most interesting is they don't even show BIGASUO projector anywhere on their product page and they only have two projectors listed. Just seems odd to me. Anyway, that's the good and the bad based on using it once.<br/><br/>Update: The company has reached out to me after becoming aware of my dissatisfaction and I have to say their customer service has been great; albeit a little slow. I have increased the rating of this product.</span>

<span>Picture quality is okay.. a lil fuzzy on fast scenes but does okay.. family enjoyed it. However, I had to plug in my brothers sound bar for volume. With nothing plugged in.. the sound is so faint and you have to sit by it to hear anything.. so don't eat loud food like chips or popcorn. I tried the Bluetooth to my portable Bluetooth speaker and it connected but sounded so very low.. as if it were far away. So I charged up my speaker thinking that was the problem, unfortunately I was wrong. So then I thought maybe my speaker is broken, after all it had been a long time since I had used it. So I went and bought a new one, keep in mind I bought a new speaker that cost $25 plus tax. It was the cheapest the store had at the time. So I took it home and connected it through Bluetooth, unfortunately, it had the same results. So then I realized it's the projector with the problem. I went to visit some family and I tried Bluetooth into their speakers, exact same results. Very very very low. Like you literally have to hold speaker up to your ear to hear anything. So then my brother brought out his soundbar. He plugged it into the projector, and what do you know.. it worked finally. Only thing I hated about that is that I had to keep the sound bar plugged in next to the projector. I wanted to use Bluetooth to put the soundbar behind us as if we were in a real theater.  But luckily with the sound bar the volume worked very well. Worked like it was supposed to. Second thing I didn't like was since I couldn't use Bluetooth option .. That meant more cords and things to plug in. It's an eye sore. And more to deal with. The 3rd thing I didn't like was each time I turned the volume up or down a super loud female robot voice would announce it during movie.. "VOLUME UP!"<br/>"VOLUME UP!"<br/> "VOLUME DOWN!"<br/>" VOLUME DOWN!"<br/>it's annoying.<br/>And the last thing I did not like.. was having to adjust the picture quality every time I put in a new movie or when I had to go to menu settings. I could be watching a movie just fine with good quality, but if I paused it and clicked on menu settings, sometimes I had to adjust the quality in order to read the menu settings clearly. But it's not a big big deal because it's not hard to clear it up.. it's very simple to adjust.. just a few seconds. Other than the Bluetooth not working, its  not a bad purchase.. picture quality is good.. I displayed it on the side of my brothers trailer.  Everyone loved it. I played every famous Christmas movie on Christmas for the whole family to watch outside and play Christmas games outside. It played the Grinch with Jim Carey very clear and the Grinch in cartoon very good. Bright quality.</span>

<span>Very good projector especially if you want to do a presentation or watch a movie in daytime or outside, it has enough lumen for that purpose. Maybe you will be surprised with the very loud fan noise at first, but this is resolved turning power consumption in ECO mode. THERE IS NO audio output, not even bluetooth so you have to connect your computer or your blue-ray/DVD player directly to your speaker or soundbar. The built in speaker sound is mediocre so don't count on that unless you are watching movies in your room and not outside. Anyway this projector is mainly for presentation purposes.<br/>Very expensive. If you want a projector to watch a movie in your living room with the curtain closed, and maybe connecting roku directly, this is not your projector. Its preferable to buy a cheap, maybe 400$ LG projector with bluetooth so you can connect to your bluetooth speaker.</span>

<span> UPDATE 8/20 - Just spent 1 hour with Epson support to hear that "Wireless connections are not guaranteed" ..."Did you try another computer". I have attached a video of a stream through the projector, the audio and video on my computer are in perfect sync.<br/><br/>I am a consultant and professional trainer and in a constant search for the perfect presentation combination.  I use a Surface Pro (latest version) with an I7, 16G RAM and 500G storage. I own 3 Epson projectors, the 9200, the 1751 and now the 1795F. All 3 of these have decent pictures, the reason I purchased the 1795 was the size and brightness, it gains about 1000 lumen from the 1751 and is HD (a little bit lower than WUXGA so the 9200 has a better picture).<br/>I had high expectations with  this projector and again I am disappointed by the under performance. The wireless is useless, terrible lag, video is VERY choppy and the audio wasn't even recognizable, just hissing and crackling. Switch to Miracast (another reason for purchase), I was using an Actiontec ScreenBeam 750 for wireless to the other 2 projectors, as far as connectivity it has been flawless. The Miracast on the 1795 is good, not great, connects up quickly but there is some slight choppiness on video (I wouldn't attempt watching a video on this), this chop is prevalent on local video (streaming from the Surface Pro) as well as if watching a youtube video. I've called Epson on this and they can offer nothing, seriously even a 20mps wireless connection should be able to handle streaming video smoothly and they have no answer why the video is choppy. If you want a semblance of decent video, hardwire to HDMI (still not flawlless).<br/>Lets boil this down, if you want a compact, light, easy to pack, bright projector that has Miracast and don't embed videos in your presentations, this will work but its overpriced and loaded with features that don't work.<br/>Hope this helps...</span>

<span>It is small, and for my purpose it fit the bill.  But it is loud, like you notice the fan the entire time it's on.  It also doesnt seem to be as bright as I would have liked.  But it does auto keystone very well and it is a short throw.  So if you have a space or weight concern this will probably work for you.  One downside is the remote is still IR so it does have to be pointed right at it.</span>

<span>They customer service sent a replacement bulb and it solved the overheating issue. Great option. The projector has GREAT picture and GREAT Quality.  The size is GREAT.  Unfortunately, during my first presentation, I am a professional speaker, after about an hour use, it shut down completely.  It not only created a problem, it cost me $200 as i had to use the Hotel's backup projector and the hotel fees are outrageous.  Call tech support, helpful, but they only asked me to wait for the lamp to cool down and retry...  I can do it if I use it for leisure, not as a professional speaker!!  They want me to try it again...  Will do, but do not see why things will be different.  Can I really trust now this projector???? Do not think so...</span>

<span>Most reviews on here are for some older models, for the M2 its nice and bright, very portable, the autofocus works well and it's unlocked where you can get root access if you want to get super technical with different app stores (although since it's a custom version of Android 6 most newer streaming apps like Disney+ will give errors if you install from a third party app store) to do that install apps via the built in chrome (be extremely careful what you install so you don't get malware or brick it) with a keyboard / mouse connected. They fixed the issue where motion smoothing was on all the time, the keystone adjustments work well but add some lag so don't ever use them for gaming or anything. Too much lag for FPS games but it's great for movies.  I use mine with a yard master 2 elite screen indoors or outdoors.  You can power it via usb-c for several hours with a 100w hyper juice battery bank.  The Bluetooth range for audio on it is really bad (like 6 ft and it starts cutting out) and the smart features are kind of a joke, but if you just use hdmi and pair it with a tablet or laptop it is excellent for movie night, use the laptop to send audio to a bluetooth speaker, I'd recommend the marshall kilborn 2.  The onboard app can also play h265 mp4 nvenc files fine from USB drives if you want to save on space.  Onboard audio is decent for its size but it's much better with external audio devices with subwoofers.  Card reader doesn't work with big microsd cards.  All in all its great for portable movie nights.  Also works ok streaming to it directly from an android phone, but the built in YouTube app is buggy. Photo is it projecting on a 100" screen.<br/><br/>Edit: 2021 update, with a 3080 laptop it works at 1080p120 (120hz input but it still only outputs at 60hz) and lag is minimal for gaming with keystone adjustments turned off.</span>

<span>Pros- The M2 is Bright and clear when inside with some ambient light.  love it and glad I bought it despite a few draw backs I can live with.<br/>Nice case, portable.  Bought a Yoobao 26800 mAh 45w power bank works perfect with it.  We enjoy it nightly, i love it, but to be fair I gotta tell you the cons so you know what your getting.<br/><br/>Cons<br/>-the remote feels like sometimes you need to push it more than once but it could be lag, or has to be perfectly aimed, not sure yet but it lacks compared to other remotes, especially considering the year it came out.<br/>- smart apps are lame considering a mouse is required, again pointing to the lame remote that should be able to move the cursor in netflix.  Roku made this a non issue. Seriously viewsonic, this is weak considering smart tvs been around a while.<br/>- the fps seems to be less than 30, sometimes 10 when watching via roku. I'm tech savvy and have yet to find the perfect settings to fix this.  Could be the 4 corner adjustment causing it to lag.<br/>- 4 corner adjustment, hmm, glad it has it, but it shouldn't have to.  The auto keystone works good ONLY if its perfectly level, and your screen is perfectly level (like a blank wall with extra room to spare) however soon as you put it on a limit size (like a pull down screen) where the edges need to be perfectly lined up, you'll need to use the 4 corner adjustment to line it up, which overrides the auto keystone and then seems to lag and slow down the frames per second.<br/>- all of these point me to belive it has a weak processor that can only handle so much.  At first I thought it might be my roku sick but roku stick works fine on all my other TV's and is a higher end 4k stick.  We have very fast internet so i don't feel like it was a connection issue.<br/><br/>- HDR says it has it, even shows in the options, but says off and grayed out, even thought roku supports hdr it doesn't seem to want to turn on in the m2.  No other settings to turn it on, maybe it will get a firmware patch someday.  Not sure it needs it, it's already rich in color and contrast. But just knowing it should...<br/><br/>Summary- still glad I spent extra for the HD and lumens, I can live with the issues or work around them.</span>

<span>I am a photographer who does projector-based installation pieces, so this review is from the perspective of someone who needed a projector that could meet the following demands:<br/><br/>- Portability (needed to be easily packed into carry-on/checked baggage or a gear bag)<br/>- Accuracy (bright enough to be at least partially visible in a lighted space, good focus and color reproduction)<br/>- Adjustability (significant control over projection properties like keystone)<br/><br/>Overall, I think this is a really promising unit, by those metrics.<br/><br/>At 7.2" square and 2.1" tall, the projector is about the size of a microwave dinner, and the included power block has been kept small too. Although not noted in the listing, it ships with a soft carry case that would be fine for people taking it to a friend's house or what have you; however, I will be buying a custom hard case for travel.<br/><br/>I knew it wasn't going to be as bright as non-portable products that I'd used, but given that they are around 4x bigger the M2e punches well above it's proverbial weight. Images are clearly visible in a room with ambient daylight, and at least discernible in standard overhead light (I'm sure a direct spot in a gallery or exhibition hall would overpower it, though).<br/><br/>I'm pleased with the accuracy of the projection as well. The auto focus seems to work most of the time, and there's a manual mode if you need it. To the degree I've tested it, the image looks sharp on a typical wall surface, and also on the fabrics I tend to use in my installations. But perhaps more important to an artist (or movie buff), the color reproduction is quite solid. None of the preset modes is garish (I think I'm liking "Brightest" the best for neutrality) but if you aren't quite happy with them there are sliders and user profiles available. I looked at a LOT of reviews of different portable projectors and was really concerned about the sorts of color distortions that were possible, so I'm feeling relieved on that front.<br/><br/>Operating the M2e is simple, with a friendly user interface, and economical/intuitive remote. Keystone problems can be tackled via Auto mode or with a 4-Corner mode that will really help me deal with the weird surfaces and spaces I tend to use. This level of adjustability was a big reason for my purchase, and I am legitimately impressed with the ease of use and results. There are a few ways to get your images through the projector: USB C, USB A, and HDMI. But that brings me to the CAVEAT: I was honestly shocked that you apparently can't loop video when playing off of a storage device. This is obviously something an artist or retailer, etc. would need and I'm baffled as to why it's not there (especially when it's an option for music playback). Thankfully, although I'd never suspected such a glaring flaw would exist, I often overthink things and had happened to have purchased a separate media player (Micca mplay mini) which does allow that function. Alternately, I'm guessing laptop users can loop from whatever player app they're using. But you can't just plug a thumb drive in and walk away. Weird design decision that mars an otherwise nifty piece of gear. (One other irritation is that there are zero physical controls on the device itself. Lose remote and that's it.)<br/><br/>Specs-wise and considering my limited use so far, I think this is the best possible portable projector for the specific demands of a traveling artist. But make sure you have your playback needs covered!</span>

<span>I've owned two ViewSonic Projectors, the M1 and the M1+ and while I liked them both, the picture was not bright enough for daytime or nightime viewing with lights on in my living room.  But both of them were very good, small, QUIET, easy to use projectors.  The M2 really raises the bar.  Here is a summary of why it is so good:<br/><br/>-&gt; Dead quiet.  No fan, period.  For viewing indoors this is a must.  I tried other more traditional projectors and just could not get past the sound of a fan running constantly.<br/>-&gt; Bright enough.  I had to keep the lights off in my living room, drapes closed, skylight blinds closed with the M1 and M1+.  No longer with the M2.  Easy to watch with lights on or during the daytime.<br/>-&gt; Autofocus - All three ViewSonics have been good for keystone adjustments, but both the M1 and M1+ requires you to manually turn a focus knob on the side of the projector.  The M2 autofocuses every time it powers up and any time you want with a push of the remote button.<br/>-&gt; Complete control - the remote works better on the M2 than either of the M1s - not requiring you to point it precisely at the projector.  The ViewSonic remote app for the iPhone works great.  And the Amazon Alexa integration works great too.<br/><br/>The only downside to the M2 is it doesn't have a built in battery like the M1s both do - if you want to use it for business or educational presentations where you have to setup and project quickly the M1s could be superior, but the lamp brightness of the M2 is so much better that it really shouldn't be an issue to have to plug it in.</span>

<span>Can't use it with a Google phone, an iPad, a samsung phone. Did hook it up to a computer and it works, also works with the Google TV stick. Overall a sub par product. Not my first projector. Sound is pretty quiet, you need to hook it up to some kind of an external speaker. Wouldn't recommend it. I had a better mini projector five years ago and it was built a smart phone. Poor customer service.<br/><br/>I'm giving it three stars because it does work and it is very light-weight, so once you get it to work with something (like the aforementioned Google Chromecast stick) then it serves its purpose. This would have been a five star projector 10 years ago, a four star projector 5 years ago, as of 2017 it's a 3 star projector.<br/><br/>If it's your first projector, then you'll be amazed, but there are much better projectors out there.</span>

<span>This is my second projector. I purchased another one here on Amazon. And I returned it because the keystone was limited and the picture would get blurry on the outside edges of the screen. It also wasn’t as bright and sharp as I wanted. This projector basically resolved all those issues and it was around the same price.<br/><br/>PROS<br/><br/>- 4D Keystone adjustment makes it easy to adjust the screen to the exact size and corners of your screen without getting blurry.<br/><br/>- Projector doesn’t have to be placed in the center. Because of the 4d keystone you can place this projector in a corner and just adjust the keystone to make it a perfect rectangle from an angle.<br/><br/>- The sharpness or picture quality is amazing and HD. There is no blurriness when adjusting the keystone like you find with other projectors.<br/><br/>- Loud speakers. Although I can connect this to my AV receiver using a Bluetooth adapter or wire, the projector internal speakers are extremely loud on their own. You really don’t need any external speakers if you don’t want or have them.<br/><br/>- Easy to set up. I didn’t even bother reading the manual and I was able to figure out how to set up everything.<br/><br/>- Works great with a tv stick like a roku.<br/><br/>- All the ports are on the back so your roku or Amazon stick don’t stick out on the side and look unsightly.<br/><br/>CONS<br/><br/>- The remote isn’t back lit so it’s hard to see what you’re pressing in a dark room.<br/><br/>- The fan is a little loud but eventually you forget it’s there as you’re watching your shows.<br/><br/>- Bluetooth works but there is a slight delay which became annoying. You’re better off using the internal speakers of the projector or using a hardwire.<br/><br/>- I noticed that HBO max and Disney + sound stopped working. I had to change the sound setting of my roku to stereo to resolve it. All the other streaming services seemed to work without having to make that adjustment.<br/><br/>- You won’t be able to properly mirror certain streaming services using your device because they are blocked by those services for projectors. So be sure you get a roku or amazon stick to fix this.<br/><br/>- I wish when you turned the projector turned on it would just default to the last input. But instead you will be brought to the main screen where you need to select the input again. It feels like an extra step that could be fixed with a software update.<br/><br/>All and all I’m happy with this projector. The price is right and the quality is high. I don’t know if I’ll go back to using my 65 inch tv at this point. Lol</span>

<span>I've had this projector for well over a year now. The image is great the sound is good and the overall quality is perfect for the family to enjoy a great night in to enjoy a movie or your favorite tv series. We did have a problem with our first projector and contacted the company and received prompt responses and solutions to our problem. They had a new projector sent out and we were back enjoying it once again in no time. They genuinely wish there customers to enjoy there product and go the extra mile to make them happy. If they have a product that has a problem the are always looking to improve there product and seek as much feed back as they can get. I would highly recommend them to anyone looking to get a projector.</span>

<span>Don't know how many hours this will last, but man o man am I impressed. These folks have got their act together and manufactured a high quality, simple to operate, loaded proyector, that  offers what people need; great picture, great conectivity, and to be user friendly.

<span>This projector will blow you away!<br/>Incredibly compact (4x4 inches or 10x10 cm) and surprisingly bright! I've used this with my living room lights on and could still use the projector, and when you have it in your bedroom with the lights off its a full blown movie projector! The images are sharp and crisp, and the short-throw of the ML750ST is INCREDIBLE! With my projector just 10 feet away by our bed this projects the ENTIRE WALL! We've hooked up an Amazon Fire TV stick to this and now stream all our movies (NetFlix, Vudu, Prime, YouTube, etc). This has ruined my 42" flat-screen TV for me. I have also hooked up our Bose Soundlink speaker (using aux cable) and now have a fantastic experience with a tremendously huge image. I was skeptical at first that this little unit could do 200" images, but not anymore! Great quality, great value, and no regrets! It even comes in a bag the size of a school lunch box! We plan to take this projector to work meetings, volunteer meetings that we belong to, as well as hosting movie nights and generally using this on a daily basis in our room for watching movies from now on. The comfort of having an LED light source with a 20,000 hour lamp life makes this a joy to own and use without any anxiety of trying to limit it's uses or worry about buying an expensive replacement bulb that will dim over time. This is truly how projectors should be, compact, long-life, and really fun to use daily without worry. I highly recommend this projector for first time projector owners and people who want to dabble with what projectors can do for you. The 720p HD image is plenty crisp at these projected wall sizes for movies, trust me, you'll LOVE this projector.<br/><br/>Now my review wouldn't be complete without any drawbacks:<br/>The file reader and system on this projector is slow - like read your USB drive for a minute or two slow. But its mini SD card reader is blazingly fast (which is an okay alternative). To use the internal storage is a real pain though, you need to have a male USB-A to male USB-A cord lying around (or buy one) to hook it up to your computer and copy files over to. It has around 2 GB of file storage internally that you can use and access from the Media menu. Video looping for backgrounds can also be annoying as the unit will display the video titles and controls for 5 seconds every time it loops the file. Ideally this unit shines while using an HDMI smart device (ie. Roku, Fire TV, Chromecast, Shield TV, etc). At least with a Shield TV or Steam Link you can stream your games and play them like never before!<br/>But as other reviewers have pointed out, the speaker on this unit (while it does work) is tin sounding and weak, having an aux input speaker handy will really make you LOVE this unit, so be mindful if you don't already own another usable sound source. If you're worried about Bluetooth the Amazon Fire TV has a Bluetooth connection pairing ability that you can use if this is a deal-breaker for you.</span>

<span>Easy 5 star, just how easy it is to take around and versatile it is for use, I bought a screw on stand for it with adjustable grip and i pretty much hang it from the ceiling, being so light I don't worry much at all from the weight bringing it down/loosening, and thank you so much for the mini PC with AUX plug in adapter! it works like a charm and have it on a 2 speaker + subwoofer set up behind me with a 9.5 wide and 5.7 high (feet) projected screen (max for my room size and can go bigger!), I use it for games a lot and the quality is really good to see far away ahead of me in games!<br/><br/>Though there are 2 small issues that could be fixed (maybe) when it runs for a long time like 5+ hours on a setting that makes the temp go up you can hear the small buzzing sound coming from the fans (on quiet times) but it gets drowned out by noise, and the other thing is that when its hanging up side down all the fan vibration causes the focus to reset/change on its own, I have to climb up like every 30-60 mins to re-adjust, but its been fixed temporarily with tape! and now if I'm lucky I have to re-adjust every 1-2 days if I use it for a long time (adhesive gets worn out) but if its sitting straight up nothing happens, just when its upside down.<br/><br/>If your the kind of person who is smart enough to not buy a big screen TV for the same price as this, and yet not be big enough to match the screen size of this! I totally recommend this for you! showing some of my friends this made them reconsider the choice they made buying such a heavy piece of television! the small carrying bag is very convenient!</span>

<span>I normally don't trust reviews on Amazon, so I went around a lot of other venues, and looked up reviews on this. Most of the reviews were for this unit's predecessor, the ML500.<br/><br/>They gushed. Every single one. I grudgingly got this unit.<br/><br/>I already own an EX330, which is a badass little unit, but is still just a bit too big for carry-on. Whenever I pack it, TSA ALWAYS opens my bag (which is often stuffed to the max, and they will mess things up when they reclose my bag), so I need to carry on the projector.<br/><br/>First, this thing is REALLY SMALL. The pictures don't really show how small it is, because the overall proportions pretty much match those of larger ultraportables. However, the lens is really small.<br/><br/>The cables and power brick are basically bigger and heavier than the unit itself. With a little creative re-packing, you can fit this into a really small package.<br/><br/>I tested with HDMI and some pretty hi-def digital input.<br/><br/>Normally, I've been ignoring pico and LED projectors, as they project tiny, dim images only a couple dozen inches across.<br/><br/>This is not a pico. It will project a full-size image, just like my 330, and almost as bright.<br/><br/>It's visible in a lit room, even an image that covers an entire 72" X 48" whiteboard. The EX330 is a bit brighter in a lit room, but not that much brighter, and the EX330 is rated at over 2000 lumens (LED lumens are basically brighter than incandescent ones, because coherence).<br/><br/>The ML1000 is brighter, but it is also physically larger, and I need this to be very small. I can use my EX330 for bigger stuff.<br/><br/>When you dim the lights, the image is tack-sharp, and beautifully saturated. Once focused, it tends to keep its focus, even when moved around. It's not as nice as a laser projector, which basically never needs focusing, but it is better than an incandescent one, which can be finicky.<br/><br/>There is a focus knob, but no way to adjust the zoom, except by physically moving the unit, which isn't that big a deal, as the unit is fairly short-throw. You should keep this in mind when setting up. Plan to have a long wire to your computer, as you may need to set the unit up on a table (a little one), or a tripod (it has a tripod standard 1/4" threaded hole).<br/><br/>The tripod thing is nice. One of my biggest frustrations is getting a table set up for a projector. Since this thing is so small, you can mount it on even a very small or cheap tripod (like a point-and-shoot tripod).<br/><br/>It has 3 fans, but doesn't get more than a bit warm (It's not like the "hair dryer" from my 330). The fans do contribute a bit of noise, but nothing like the incandescent unit.<br/><br/>I don't particularly care about watching TV on these things. I use them for presentations, and I have yet to encounter a projector, from any manufacturer, that won't handle basic presentations.<br/><br/>If you are gonna shell out $550 bucks on a little thing like this, then you should feel its worth it. I feel it was money well-spent.<br/><br/>PROS:<br/>  Absolutely tiny. Easily fits in a standard brief case or a carry-on.<br/>  Extremely bright. Astonishingly so.<br/>  Can be mounted on a tripod, so you have more options to setting it up.<br/>  Surprisingly "short throw." This means that you can place it fairly near the screen.<br/>  I have the entire thing packaged in a small LowePro digicam bag. That's including an 8-foot HDMI cable and a micro tripod.<br/>  I also dropped the thing from about 3 feet, and nothing happened at all. My 330 would have been destroyed.<br/>  This thing is absolutely fine for 90% of my presentation needs.<br/><br/>CONS:<br/>  Has 3 fans, which can be a bit "whiny."<br/>  No zoom. You have to move the unit.<br/>  Surprisingly "short throw." This means that you have to place it fairly near the screen, which is not always desirable.<br/>  External power brick. This is always a pet peeve of mine. The brick is fairly large, as well, with a 3-prong plug. I'd love it if it were a little dinky thing.<br/>  Color ain't perfect. Tends to have a red cast. I was able to get something better with a calibrator, but still a bit off. The 330 definitely has better color.<br/>  The focus can change from top to bottom if you have the unit fairly near the screen.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, an entire industry has sprung up to create shill reviews. In general, don't believe five-star reviews on Amazon. I wish it were different, but there's lots of money at stake, and whenever there's money at stake, there's unscrupulous people willing to take it.<br/><br/>This isn't a shill; but then, that's what a shill would say. Take this review for what it's worth.<br/><br/>UPDATE: Added a few more notes, now that I have used it a few times.</span>

<span>I shopped around and finally settled on this projector. The several big attributes of this projector that I loved are:<br/><br/>- It's got great resolution, not just 640/480, like many of it's competitors<br/><br/>- The brightness is outstanding and works well in small rooms. IHonestly, it's project specs are better many other brands that cost more<br/><br/>- It's wireless (wi-fi)! I don't need to carry a long cable for the data. I just give it power, sync up with wi-fi and I'm done!<br/><br/>- It's very lightweight, which I wanted. It's bigger than some of the 'cigarette-box size' of some competitors, but their brightness is lousy. this one is great.<br/><br/>I'm very happy I bought it and it's fun to use!<br/><br/>Downside: the documentation borders on worthless! It should be pretty easy to write some decent documentation, but they don't have it. Some things I learned:<br/><br/>- Unplug the wi-fi dongle if you want to cable the device to the laptop. You may ask why I would ever want to wire connect the projector to your laptop/tablet? Because you laptop's wi-fi card connects to the projector which looks like an wifi access device (you connect to it's SSID). If you want the laptop to be able to use wi-fi to connect to the web while you are using the projector, you'll find that you can't have your laptop connected to two things at the same time. For a tech geek like me, no problem, however for 'normal' people, they'll get all tied up trying to figure it out.<br/><br/>- If the wifi dongle is plugged in, you'll have trouble selecting the cable for input. Just pull it, but don't lose it! It's pretty tiny.<br/><br/>- Don't lose the remote! The only way to work through the projector's options is with the remote. I velcro'ed it to the top of the projector so that I can't lose it. No remote, then you'll be unable to change inputs, resolution, etc.<br/><br/>These are the biggies that bothered me - but despite the doc, it's well worth buying if you need a small projector.</span>

<span>First off; I’ve only used the projector once. I will update this review as time goes on and I use it more.<br/><br/>-Background: This is my first projector so I did quite a bit of research trying to find something that worked for me. Once I started researching I ended up going down the rabbit hole so to speak. There’s so many things to keep in mind when buying one (lumens, bulb life, throwback distance, number of connection ports, connectivity to external speakers, whether or not the bulb is replaceable, etc. I learned all this while researching and reading other people’s reviews so take your time and do some reading too).<br/>I first bought an Epson projector because it’s a “brand” name. It was beautiful and easy to navigate. I didn’t even have to read the instructions BUT I returned it because it turned out to be a pain to try and attach external speakers to it.<br/><br/>-What I was looking for: A simple projector to watch movies outdoors with the family (we have two nieces ages 6 and 4). I didn’t want something super expensive because I knew that we would only use it a few times a year, hence it made no sense to me to spend a ton of money on a projector AND external speakers. I just  wanted something fun for the girls (let’s face it, what do kids know about great movie/sound quality?)<br/>We’re not picky people so I wasn’t looking for movie theater quality picture and sound. All I wanted was something fun to share with the family.<br/><br/>-What I found: If you’re looking for movie theater quality picture and sound you’re going to HAVE to spend thousands of dollars on a projector and external speakers. If that’s not a problem for you, then go for it. If you’re just looking to have some fun with the family find something that won’t break the bank BUT remember that you get what pay for. So if you buy one of those $99 projectors, don’t expect greatness.<br/><br/>-Pros: GREAT family projector.<br/>Picture is clear and crisp. Easy to navigate once you figure out how to do it ; )<br/>Giant screen if you have the room to move your projector  back so you get the screen size you want. We played an hour and forty movie for the girls and when it was over the projector was not hot. Not even warm to the touch. We did not notice the noise from the fan at all but keep in mind that we were outdoors and not sitting next to it. I did try it indoors first to figure out how to use it and even then I did not think the fan was very loud.<br/><br/>-Cons: Despite what the product description says, the projector speakers ARE NOT LOUD. You are going to need external speakers.<br/>The instructions for the projector are written weird. It’s really hard to understand them but after playing around for a few minutes I had it down. It’s not rocket science so don’t let that deter you from getting this projector.<br/><br/>BOTTOM LINE: So far I’m totally happy with this projector. I recommend it if like us, you’re looking to have fun with your family. Our first outdoor movie night went great.<br/>For sound I bought a 25ft long audio/video cable and connected that to the headphone jack of the projector and then I connected the other end to one of those Costco square portable black speakers and that worked for us. I also tried it with the computer speakers we have and that worked too (indoors, when I was trying to figure out what to use for sound).<br/>I already had a VGA cable to connect my iPad/iPhone to the projector via their included HDMI cable and stream Disney+ for the movie we saw.<br/><br/>Again, I’m very happy with this purchase and I recommend it.<br/><br/>I will update my review as we get more use out of it.</span>

<span>We bought this off Amazon warehouse and am so glad we did!  This was very easy to set up (even without instructions), it has lots of options for connecting it to phone, DVD players etc.  My husband and I (both mid 40's) missed removing the lens cap (duh).  Thankfully our 18 year old daughter figured that out for us.  Once we had that, and all the proper cords to connect it to our devices it, it's been great.  We purchased this along with a large inflatable screen for our back yard.  Now we can get the thrill of a drive in movie without having to go anywhere!  We plan to use this well into the fall as well. We've been using it on a small table, which is less than desirable outside due to uneven ground but I'm hoping a tripod will correct that issue.  We had purchased one at walmart but the legs were missing.  The cords ended up costing a bit so it might make sense to purchase a blue tooth projector but for us, this was perfect.</span>

<span>Can not beat this projector for the price and resolution.  Unfortunately, mine died after a year and a half of 24/7 use, however due to an electrical surge during a storm.  Instead of buying a new one, I decided since the unit still worked and I could still see half of the screen that I would tear it down and found that it was just the LCD screen that needed to be replaced :) $40 later and a few screws, we are back in business.  Very easy tare down permitting you have a long enough screw driver.  Found the LCD replacement on e-bay from a US based seller in Cali, (PartNo: C058GWW1-0), images attached of the old LCD with dead pixels and the new LCD.</span>
